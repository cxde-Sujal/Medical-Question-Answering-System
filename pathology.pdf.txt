Foreword to the Sixth Edition
A few years ago I wrote the Foreword to the Fifth Edition of this Textbook. For details and reasons why I liked Professor
Mohan’s book and why I recommended it then, please refer to my previous foreword below. My positive reaction to the
previous Edition probably gives some clues on why I accepted the second invitation, this time to introduce the Sixth Edition
to new students of Pathology and other potential readers.
Great French writer André Gide once said “le problème n’est pas comment réussir mais comment durer”, which in
translation to English means: The problem is not how to succeed but how to last. The fact that Dr Mohan’s book has reached
its Sixth Edition is the best sign that you are holding in your hands a very successful book, and probably one of the medical
bestsellers published on the Indian subcontinent. Up to now, it has been used by thousands of students and I am sure that it
will continue to be read and cherished in the new Edition as well.
For the Sixth Edition, Dr Mohan has partially restructured the book, substantially revised it, and updated the text wherever
it was necessary. Following the advances of basic sciences and clinical pathology, the revisions and addition are most evident
in portions pertaining to molecular biology and genetics. Other aspects of modern pathology have not been neglected either
and contain numerous novelties; even the seasoned specialists will learn something new from each and every chapter.
Furthermore, the author has dramatically increased the number of illustrations, which are so essential for understanding
Pathology. The distribution of illustrations has also been changed so that they are now much closer to the text to which they
relate.
For the new generation of modern students who have grown up next to the computers, the author has placed all the
images and tables on the website with facility for downloading them. These images will serve the twin purpose of quick
review and self-assessment for students and will appeal to Pathology teachers who could use them for their lectures, being
assured that their students will have access to the same material for review and study. The Quick Review Book, the ever
popular companion to the previous two Editions, was also updated, succinctly supplementing the main text. It will provide
a helpful study material to many a student and help them review the subject for examinations.
In summary, it is my distinct pleasure and honour to most enthusiastically endorse the new edition of an established
textbook and salute its publication. Dr Mohan deserves kudos for the job well done and for providing the medical students
with such an attractive, modern, up-to-date and useful Textbook of Pathology.

Foreword to the Fifth Edition
As the Book Review Editor of the journal Modern Pathology, the official journal of the United States-Canadian Academy of Pathology I am
used to receiving medical books. These books are sent to my office from publishers, with a standard request for a potential review in the
Journal. Nevertheless a recent package from New Delhi caught me by surprise.
As you already might have guessed, the parcel contained a copy of the 5th Edition of the Textbook of Pathology written by Professor
Harsh Mohan, together with the Second Edition of the pocket size companion Pathology Quick Review and MCQs. Included was also a
friendly letter from Mr JP Vij, the Publisher. I acknowledged the receipt of the books by email, and also congratulated the Publisher on a job
well done. A brief electronic exchange between Kansas City and New Delhi ensued, whereupon Mr Vij asked me to write a foreword for the
Reprint of 5th Edition of the Textbook. I accepted the invitation with pleasure.
Even though there were no specific instructions attached to the request, I assumed that I should address my notes primarily to
undergraduate and graduate students of Pathology. Furthermore, I decided to write the Foreword in the form of answers to the questions
that I would have had if I were a medical student entering the field of Pathology. I hope that these hypothetical questions and answers of
mine will be of interest to the readers of this Textbook.
Question 1: Is this a good book?
Answer: Yes. This is a modern Textbook written by an expert who knows his pathology; an experienced teacher who knows what is
important and what is not, and who has obviously taught pathology for many years; a well informed academician who is au courant with
modern trends in medical education, and knows how to present pathology as a preparatory step for future clinical education of medical
students.
Question 2: How does the book compare with the leading textbooks of pathology in the USA, Great Britain and Germany?
Answer: Very favorably. This Indian Textbook covers more or less the same topics as the equivalent Textbooks currently used in the
Western Hemisphere. Like the Western textbooks it covers the traditional fields of General and Systemic Pathology: one-third of the book
Foreword

viii
Textbook of Pathology
is devoted to General Pathology, whereas the remaining two-thirds cover Systemic Pathology. The emphasis is on classical anatomic
pathology. In that respect the Indian textbook resembles more the European than the American textbooks, which have become more
clinically-oriented. In my opinion this approach gives excellent results, but only if the students have enough time to devote to Pathology. In
most US medical schools this is not the case any more, and thus pathology is not taught as extensively as before. Histopathology has been
deleted from most curricula, and most American medical students do not know to use efficiently the microscope, which is unfortunate.
Question 3: Is the material presented in a “student-friendly” manner?
Answer: The material is presented in a systematic manner in the best tradition of classical British textbooks, a tradition that can be traced to
the classical writers of ancient Greece and Rome. This time tested teaching will be most appreciated by students who are methodical and do
not take shortcuts in their effort to acquire encyclopedic knowledge of pathology. On the other hand, even if your learning method is based
on “cherry-picking”, i.e. you concentrate only on the most important facts in each chapter, the structure of the text will allow you to do it
quite easily as well. There are no ideal books that would satisfy everybody in every respect, but there is no doubt that Professor Mohan’s
book is close to ideal for a classical pathology course and I predict that it will be popular with many students.
Question 4: What are the most salient features of this textbook?
Answer: Clear writing. As we all know clear writing reflects clear thinking, and clear thinking in my opinion, is an absolute prerequisite for
good teaching. Judging from the book at hand, Professor Mohan (whom I do not know personally) is not only a clear thinker, but he must
be also an exceptionally talented teacher.
Clear and visually pleasing presentation. The exposition is logical and well structured. Each chapter is subdivided into smaller entities,
which are further divided into paragraphs, ideally suited for easy reading. Color coded headings and the added emphasis in form of words
printed in bold or capital letters are additional attractions that facilitate learning.
Exceptionally good illustrations, flow-charts and tables. Unique to this Textbook are the numerous hand-drawn color illustrations, including
many renditions of histopathologic slides. These drawings are simple, but to the point and well annotated. Students will most likely
understand them much easier than the relatively impersonal original microphotographs of the same histopathologic lesions. Flow-charts
are most efficiently used to explicate the pathogenesis of various lesions or the pathophysiology of disease processes. The tables are good
for classifications and comparative listings of closely related diseases and their pathologic features.
Companion pocket book (baby-book of pathology). I always recommend to my students to buy a major textbook and a smaller review book
containing a digest of the most important concepts; or a book of questions and answers, so that the student could test his/her knowledge of
pathology and the understanding of the material in the main textbook. I was pleased to see that Professor Mohan shares my teaching
philosophy and has taken upon himself to prepare for his students a shorter version of main text. This pocket book is also garnered with
review questions.
The medical students are thus getting a bargain— two books for the price of one. At the same time, they have a unique opportunity to
see, from the example set by their teacher, on how the same material can be approached from two points of view, and presented in two
formats. The old adage, that you have never learned anything unless you have seen it at least from two sides, is clearly illustrated here. For
the students of medicine the message is clear: if you understand the material presented in both the shorter and the longer version you can
be assured that you know your Pathology inside out; and you are ready for the final examination and clinical training.
Question 5: Do I have to know all that is in this book for my final examination?
Answer: No!! This is the most common question my students ask me and I hope that you believe me when I say that you do not have to
know it all. First of all, neither I nor Professor Mohan know it all. Second, few of us have photographic memory and infinite storage space
in our brains and thus even theoretically, very few of us could learn this book by heart. I can assure you that the book was not written for
those geniuses, but for the average persons like most of us. Third, your goal should not be to memorize all the facts listed in the textbook,
but rather to understand the main concepts. Since the concepts cannot be fully understood or taught without specific examples, by necessity
you will have to learn “some nitty-gritty details”. The more details you know, the deeper your understanding of the basic concepts will be.
Memorizing the details without the understanding of concepts that hold them together is not something that I would recommend. The
beauty of it all is that you can decide for yourself how deep to dig in, when to stop, what to keep and memorize, and what to eliminate. And
remember, deciding on what to eliminate is almost as important as choosing what to retain. As the educational gurus teach us, that is the
gist of what they call active learning. And to repeat again, this Textbook is ideally suited for that approach.
At the end, let me repeat how excited I was perusing this excellent book. I hope that you will be similarly excited and I hope that it will
inspire in you enthusiasm for Pathology.
Remember also the words of the great clinician William Osler, one of the founders of modern medicine in late 19th and early 20th
Century, who said that our clinical practice will be only as good as our understanding of Pathology.
I hope that I have answered most of the questions that you might have had while opening this book. If you have any additional
questions that I did not anticipate, please feel free to send me an email at idamjano@kumc.edu. Good luck!

Preface
The overwhelming success and all-round acceptance of the last edition of the textbook was very encouraging and quite
stimulating but at the same time put an onerous responsibility and expectation to do better in the new edition than the best
of last edition.  In preparing 6th revised edition of my Textbook of Pathology, I pursued this goal with profound enthusiasm
and passionate zeal. I am, thus, pleased to present to users a wholly transformed appearance and updated contents in the
revised edition. While full colour printing had been introduced in the last edition 5 years back maturing the book into an
international edition, the present redesigned and revised edition has utlilised the contemporary technological advances in its
full form in illustrations, lay-out and in printing. The revised edition has almost thrice the number of illustrations of large
number of common diseases placed along with the text, and it is hoped that it will enhance understanding and learning of the
subject readily, besides being a visual treat.
In recent times, advances in genetics, immunology and molecular biology have heightened our understanding of the
mechanisms of diseases. As a result, mention of ‘idiopathic’ in etiology and pathogenesis of most diseases in the literature is
slowly disappearing. Surely, the students of current times need to be enlightened on these modern advances in diseases;
these aspects have been dealt in the revised edition with a simple and lucid approach.
Some of the Key Features of the Sixth Edition are as follows:
Thorough Textual Revision and Updating: All the chapters and topics have undergone thorough revision and updating of
various aspects, including contemporary diagnostic modalities. While most of the newer information has been inserted
between the lines, a few topics have been rewritten, e.g. current concepts on cell injury, immunopathology, carcinogenesis,
newer infectious diseases, lymphomas-leukaemias, hypertension, interstitial lung diseases, etc. to name a few. In doing so,
the basic accepted style of the book —simple, easy-to-understand and reproduce the subject matter, and emphasis on clarity
and accuracy, has not been disturbed. Past experience has shown that the readers find tables on contrasting features and
listing of salient features as a very useful medium for quick learning; considering their utility 15 new tables have been added
in different chapters in the revised edition.
Reorganisation of the Book: In a departure from the conventional division of study of the subject into General and
Systemic Pathology, the revised edition has been reorganised into 3 major sections—General Pathology and Basic Techniques
(Chapters 1 to 11), Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues (Chapters 12 to 14) and Systemic Pathology (Chapters 15 to
30), followed by Appendix (containing Normal Values), Further Readings for references and Index. In my considered
judgement, a separate section on haematology and lymphoid tissues and redistribution of their subtopics was necessitated
for two reasons—firstly, reclassification of leukaemias-lymphomas by the WHO as an integrated topic, making the segregation
of study of diseases of ‘circulating’ and ‘tissue’ leucocytes superfluous; and secondly, due to advances in haematology,
transfusion medicine and diseases of lymphoreticular tissues, these subspecialties of pathology have developed a lot in
recent times, requiring the students to focus on them separately for learning and they are evaluated too on these topics by
separate experts. Similarly, in the revised edition, two chapters on laboratory techniques—Techniques for the Study of
Pathology (Chapter 2) and Basic Diagnostic Cytology (Chapter 11) have been included in Section-I in view of technological
advances in pathology which have gone beyond remaining confined as research tool but have increasingly become part of
diagnostic work-up.
Profusely Illustrated: Majority of illustrations in the revised Edition are new additions while a few old ones have been done
again. All the line-drawing and schematic cartoons have been updated and improved in content as well as their presentation
by preparing them again on CorelDraw in soft colours, eliminating the shortcomings noticed in them in previous edition. All
free-hand labelled sketches of gross specimens and line-drawings of microscopic features of an entity have been placed
alongside the corresponding specimen photograph and the photomicrograph respectively, enhancing the understanding of
the subject for the beginner students in pathology. In doing so, the number of figures has gone up by about three-folds in the
present edition, some incorporated as an inset with focus on a close-up microscopic view.
Truly User-friendly: Rational use of various levels of headings and subheadings in different colours, bold face and in italics
has been done in the text in order to highlight key points. All the citations of figures and tables in the text have been shown
in colour now to make the related text vividly visible and to help user locate the same quickly on a page. It is hoped that these
features will enable the user with rapid revision at the end of a topic, making the book truly user-friendly.
Much More Content but Unaltered Volume: While the new edition has a lot more updated textual material, more tables and
a marked increase in the number of figures than the previous edition, a meticulous and rational page management has
helped in retaining almost the same girth of the book as before.
Preface

Textbook of Pathology
Images and Tables on the Web: All the illustrations and tables included in this edition are being put on the website with a
scratch key word on the inner page of the cover jacket. The students would find these useful for quick review and for self-
assessment in which an unlabelled image (gross specimen or a photomicrograph) appears, followed by the labelled image
with diagnosis corresponding to the same figure and table in the textbook. Besides, ready availability of these downloadable
images and tables would be useful to fellow teachers for possibly including the same in their lectures.
Revised Pathology Quick Review and MCQs: The sixth edition of textbook is accompanied with the new revised baby-book
popular with many students and interns. This small book has been found profoundly useful by the students just before
practical examination to face viva voce when they need to revise huge course content in a short time, or by those preparing to
take postgraduate entrance examinations.  The revised edition has over 100 more new MCQs while some old ones have
either been edited or replaced.
A Word on Foreword: The Foreword by Prof Ivan Damjanov, MD, PhD, from Kansas University, US, for the previous edition
and now for the sixth edition so generously and meticulously prepared with an eye to the details of the book, has been most
welcome development, and has helped to bring the book closer to users in other parts of the world; I express our sincere
gratitude to this eminent teacher and well-known author whom I have yet to meet in person.
In essence, the revised edition is a comprehensive text of pathology meant primarily for students of pathology; however,
the practicing clinicians and students of other branches of medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, alternate system of medicine, and
paramedical courses may also find it useful.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The revision work was indeed a mammoth task to accomplish and would not have been possible without active cooperation
from friends and colleagues and continuous encouragement from well-wishers in general, and my departmental staff in
particular who could bear with me for prolonged spells of my sabbatical leave. All the photomicrographs included in the
present edition have been exposed afresh which has been made possible by the most valuable and selfless assistance rendered
by my colleagues, Drs Shailja, Tanvi and Ujjawal, Senior Residents in Pathology, all of whom worked tirelessly for endless
hours for months, much to the sacrifice of their personal comfort and time of their families, for which I am indebted to them.
Here, I also recall the help accorded by my former students and colleagues in preparation of earlier editions of the book and
thank once again, even though much of that may have been replaced. As always, I remain indebted to those from whom I had
the opportunity to learn pathology; in particular to Prof K Joshi, MD, PhD, PGIMER, Chandigarh, Late Prof TS Jaswal, MD, and
Prof Uma Singh, MD, formerly at PGIMS, Rohtak.
Constant strategic support and encouragement extended by the Department of Medical Education and Research,
Chandigarh Administration, during the completion of work is gratefully acknowledged.
I may have been hard-task master and highly demanding on quality and accuracy from all staff members of the
M/s Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd, at times losing my patience, but all of them have been very cooperative
and quite accommodating. In particular, I would like to thank profusely Mr Manoj Pahuja, Computer Art Designer, for
carrying out Herculean job on figures as per my requirements conscientiously and patiently with competence;
Mrs Y Kapoor, Senior Desktop Operator, for overall lay-out of the book and acceding to all my requests for amendments
smilingly and ungrudgingly till the very last minute; and Ms Chetna Malhotra, MBA, Senior Business Development Manager,
for overseeing the entire project vigilantly and efficiently. All through this period, Mr Tarun Duneja, (Director-Publishing),
M/s Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd, has been highly cooperative and supportive.
Lastly, the vision of Shri JP Vij, Chairman and Managing Director of M/s Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd, has
been to see the revised edition as unmatched internationally and keeping it affordable at the same time, much above his
business interests, and I do hope his dream comes true. Full credit goes to M/s Ajanta Printers, Faridabad, for the admirably
high quality of printing.
Finally, the users of previous editions are gratefully acknowledged for having brought this textbook at this pedestal. In
the past, I have gained profitably by suggestions from colleagues and students and I urge them to continue giving their
valuable suggestions and point out errors, if any, so that I may continue to improve it.

Chapter 1
Introduction to Pathology
Chapter 1
STUDY OF DISEASES
DEFINITION OF PATHOLOGY
The word ‘Pathology’ is derived from two Greek words—pathos
meaning suffering, and logos meaning study. Pathology is, thus,
scientific study of structure and function of the body in disease;
or in other words, pathology consists of the abnormalities that
occur in normal anatomy (including histology) and physiology
owing to disease. Another commonly used term with reference
to study of diseases is ‘pathophysiology’ comprised by two words:
patho=suffering; physiology=study of normal function.
Pathophysiology, thus, includes study of disordered function
or breakdown of homeostasis in diseases. Pathologists are the
diagnosticians of disease. Therefore, knowledge and
understanding of pathology is essential for all would-be doctors,
general medical practitioners and specialists since unless they
know the causes, mechanisms, nature and type of disease, and
understand the language spoken by the pathologist in the form
of laboratory reports, they would not be able to institute
appropriate treatment or suggest preventive measures to the
patient. For the student of any system of medicine, the discipline
of pathology forms a vital bridge between initial learning phase
of preclinical sciences and the final phase of clinical subjects.
Remember the prophetic words of one of the eminent founders
of modern medicine in late 19th and early 20th century, Sir
William Osler, “Your practice of medicine will be as good as
your understanding of pathology.”
HEALTH AND DISEASE
Before there were humans on earth, there was disease, albeit in
early animals. Since pathology is the study of disease, then what
is disease? In simple language, disease is opposite of health i.e.
what is not healthy is disease. Health may be defined as a
condition when the individual is in complete accord with the
surroundings, while disease is loss of ease (or comfort) to the
body (i.e. dis-ease). However, it must be borne in mind that in
health there is a wide range of ‘normality’ e.g. in height, weight,
blood and tissue chemical composition etc. It also needs to be
appreciated that at cellular level, the cells display wide range
of activities within the broad area of health similar to what is
seen in diseased cells. Thus, health and disease are not absolute
but are considered as relative states.
A term commonly confused with disease is illness. While
disease suggests an entity with a cause, illness is the reaction
of the individual to disease in the form of symptoms
(complaints of the patient) and physical signs (elicited by
the clinician). Though disease and illness are not separable,
the study of diseases is done in pathology while the learning
and management of illnesses is done in wards and clinics.
In addition to disease and illness, there are syndromes
(meaning running together) characterised by combination
of symptoms caused by altered physiologic processes.
TERMINOLOGY IN PATHOLOGY
It is important for a beginner in pathology to be familiar
with the language used in pathology:
Patient is the person affected by disease.
Lesions are the characteristic changes in tissues and cells
produced by disease in an individual or experimental
animal.
Pathologic changes or morphology consist of examination
of diseased tissues.
Pathologic changes can be recognised with the naked
eye (gross or macroscopic changes) or studied by microscopic
examination of tissues.
Causal factors responsible for the lesions are included
in etiology of disease (i.e. ‘why’ of disease).
Mechanism by which the lesions are produced is termed
pathogenesis of disease (i.e. ‘how’ of disease).
Functional implications of the lesion felt by the patient
are symptoms and those discovered by the clinician are the
physical signs.
Clinical significance of the morphologic and functional
changes together with results of other investigations help
to arrive at an answer to what is wrong (diagnosis), what is
going to happen (prognosis), what can be done about it
(treatment), and finally what should be done to avoid
complications and spread (prevention) (i.e. ‘what’ of disease).
EVOLUTION OF PATHOLOGY
Pathology as the scientific study of disease processes has
its deep roots in medical history. Since the beginning of

2
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
mankind, there has been desire as well as need to know more
about the causes, mechanisms and nature of diseases. The
answers to these questions have evolved over the centuries—
from supernatural beliefs to the present state of our
knowledge of modern pathology. However, pathology is not
separable from other multiple disciplines of medicine and
owes its development to interaction and interdependence on
advances in diverse neighbouring branches of science, in
addition to the strides made in medical technology. As we
shall see in the pages that follow, pathology has evolved over
the years as a distinct discipline from anatomy, medicine and
surgery, in that sequence.
The brief review of fascinating history of pathology and
its many magnificent personalities with their outstanding
contribution in the opening pages of the book is meant to pay
our obeisance to those great personalities who have laid
glorious foundations of our speciality. Life and works of those
whose names are mentioned below are linked to some disease
or process—the aim being to stimulate the inquisitive beginner
in pathology as to how this colourful specialty has emerged.
FROM RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND
MAGIC TO RATIONAL APPROACH
(PREHISTORIC TIME TO AD 1500)
Present-day knowledge of primitive culture prevalent in the
world in prehistoric times reveals that religion, magic and
medical treatment were quite linked to each other in those
times. The earliest concept of disease understood by the
patient and the healer was the religious belief that disease
was the outcome of ‘curse from God’ or the belief in magic
that the affliction had supernatural origin from ‘evil eye of
spirits.’ To ward them off, priests through prayers and
sacrifices, and magicians by magic power used to act as faith-
healers and invoke supernatural powers and please the gods.
Remnants of ancient superstitions still exist in some parts of
the world. The link between medicine and religion became
so firmly established throughout the world that different
societies had their gods and goddesses of healing; for example:
mythological Greeks had Asclepios and Apollo as the principal
gods of healing, Dhanvantri as the deity of medicine in India,
and orthodox Indians’ belief in Mata Sheetala Devi as the pox
goddess.
The period of ancient religious and magical beliefs was
followed by the philosophical and rational approach to disease
by the methods of observations. This happened at the time
when great Greek philosophers—Socrates, Plato and Aristotle,
introduced philosophical concepts to all natural phenomena.
But the real practice of medicine began with Hippocrates
(460–370 BC), the great Greek clinical genius of all times and
regarded as ‘the father of medicine’ (Fig. 1.1). Hippocrates
followed rational and ethical attitudes in practice and teaching
of medicine as expressed in the collection of writings of that
era. He firmly believed in study of patient’s symptoms and
described methods of diagnosis. The prevailing concept of
mechanism of disease based on disequilibrium of four basic
humors (water, air, fire, and earth) was propagated by
Hippocates too. He recorded his observations on cases in
writing which remained the mainstay of medicine for nearly
two thousand years (Hippocratic aphorism). Some of the
major Hippocratic methods can be summarised as under:
Observe all objectively.
Study the patient rather than the disease.
Evaluate honestly.
Assist nature.
Hippocrates introduced ethical concepts in the practice
of medicine and is revered by the medical profession by taking
‘Hippocratic oath’ at the time of entry into practice of medicine.
Greek medicine after Hippocrates reached Rome (now
Italy), which controlled Greek world after 146 BC and therefore
dominated the field of development of medicine in ancient
Europe then. In fact, since ancient times, many tongue-
twisting terminologies in medicine have their origin from
Latin language which was the official language of countries
included in ancient Roman empire (Spanish, Portugese,
Italian, French and Greek languages have their origin from
Latin).
Hippocratic teaching was propagated in Rome by Roman
physicians, notably by Cornelius Celsus (53 BC-7 AD) and
Cladius Galen (130–200 AD). Celsus first described four cardinal
signs of inflammation—rubor (redness), tumor (swelling),
calor (heat), and dolor (pain). Galen postulated humoral
theory, later called Galenic theory. This theory suggested that
the illness resulted from imbalance between four humors (or
body fluids): blood, lymph, black bile (believed to be from
the spleen), and biliary secretion from the liver.
The hypothesis of disequilibrium of four elements consti-
tuting the body (Dhatus) similar to Hippocratic doctrine finds
mention in ancient Indian medicine books compiled about
200 AD—Charaka Samhita, a finest document by Charaka on
Figure 1.1
Hippocrates (460-370 BC). The great Greek clinical
genius and regarded as ‘the father of medicine’. He introduced ethical
aspects to medicine.

medicine listing 500 remedies, and Sushruta Samhita, similar
book of surgical sciences by Sushruta, and includes about 700
plant-derived medicines.
The end of Medieval period was marked by backward
steps in medicine. There were widespread and devastating
epidemics which reversed the process of rational thinking
again to supernatural concepts and divine punishment for
‘sins.’ The dominant belief during this period was that life
was due to influence of vital substance under the control of
soul (theory of vitalism). Thus, dissection of human body was
strictly forbidden as that would mean hurting the ‘soul.’
FROM HUMAN ANATOMY TO ERA OF
GROSS PATHOLOGY (AD 1500 to 1800)
The backwardness of Medieval period was followed by the
Renaissance period i.e. revival of leaning. The Renaissance
began from Italy in late 15th century and spread to whole of
Europe. During this period, there was quest for advances in
art and science. Since there was freedom of thought, there
was emphasis on philosophical and rational attitudes again.
The beginning of the development of human anatomy
took place during this period with the art works and drawings
of human muscles and embryos by famous Italian painter
Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519). Dissection of human body was
started by Vesalius (1514–1564) on executed criminals. His
pupils, Gabriel Fallopius (1523–1562) who described human
oviducts (Fallopian tubes) and Fabricius who discovered
lymphoid tissue around the intestine of birds (bursa of
Fabricius) further popularised the practice of human anatomic
dissection for which special postmortem amphitheatres came
in to existence in various parts of ancient Europe (Fig. 1.2).
Antony van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723), a cloth merchant by
profession in Holland, during his spare time invented the first
ever microscope by grinding the lenses himself through which
he recognised male spermatozoa as tiny preformed men (or
“homunculi”) and blood corpuscles. He also introduced
histological staining in 1714 using saffron to examine muscle
fibres.
Marcello Malpighi (1624–1694) used microscope extensively
and observed the presence of capillaries and described the
malpighian layer of the skin, and lymphoid tissue in the spleen
(malpighian corpuscles). Malpighi is known as ‘the father of
histology.’
The credit for beginning of the study of morbid anatomy
(pathologic anatomy), however, goes to Italian anatomist-
pathologist, Giovanni B. Morgagni (1682–1771). Morgagni was
an excellent teacher in anatomy, a prolific writer and a
practicing clinician. By his work, Morgagni demolished the
ancient humoral theory of disease and published his life-time
experiences based on 700 postmortems and their
corresponding clinical findings. He, thus, laid the foundations
of clinicopathologic methodology in the study of disease and
introduced the concept of clinicopathologic correlation (CPC),
establishing a coherent sequence of cause, lesions, symptoms,
and outcome of disease (Fig. 1.3).
Sir Percival Pott (1714–1788), famous surgeon in England,
identified the first ever occupational cancer in the chimney
sweeps in 1775 and discovered chimney soot as the first
carcinogenic agent. However, the study of anatomy in
England during the latter part of 18th Century was
dominated by the two Hunter brothers: John Hunter (1728–
1793), a student of Sir Percival Pott, rose to become greatest
surgeon-anatomist of all times and he, together with his elder
brother William Hunter (1718–1788) who was a reputed
anatomist-obstetrician (or man-midwife), started the first
ever museum of pathologic anatomy. John Hunter made a
collection of more than 13,000 surgical specimens from his
flourishing practice, arranged them into separate organ
systems, made comparison of specimens from animals and
plants with humans, and included many clinical pathology
specimens as well, and thus developed the first museum of
comparative anatomy and pathology in the world which
became the Hunterian Museum, now housed in Royal
College of Surgeons of London (Fig.  1.4). Amongst many
pupils of John Hunter was Edward Jenner (1749–1823) whose
work on inoculation in smallpox is well known. Another
prominent English pathologist was Matthew Baillie (1760–
1823), nephew of Hunter brothers, who published first-ever
systematic textbook of morbid anatomy in 1793. The era of
gross pathology had three more illustrious and brilliant
physician-pathologists in England who were colleagues at
Guy’s Hospital in London:
Richard Bright (1789–1858) who described non-
suppurative nephritis, later termed glomerulonephritis or
Bright’s disease;
Thomas Addison (1793–1860) who gave an account of
chronic adrenocortical insufficiency termed Addison’s
disease; and
Thomas Hodgkin (1798–1866), who observed the complex
of chronic enlargement of lymph nodes, often with
enlargement of the liver and spleen, later called Hodgkin’s
disease.
Towards the end of 18th century, Xavier Bichat
(1771–1802) in France described that organs were composed
of tissue and divided the study of morbid anatomy into
General Pathology and Systemic Pathology. R.T.H. Laennec
(1781–1826), another French physician, dominated the early

part of 19th century by his numerous discoveries. He
described several lung diseases (tubercles, caseous lesions,
miliary lesions, pleural effusion, bronchiectasis), chronic
sclerotic liver disease (later called Laennec’s cirrhosis) and
invented stethoscope.
Morbid anatomy attained its zenith with appearance of
Carl F. von Rokitansky (1804–1878), self-taught German
pathologist who performed nearly 30,000 autopsies himself.
He described acute yellow atrophy of the liver, wrote an
outstanding monograph on diseases of arteries and
congenital heart defects. Unlike most other surgeons of that
time, Rokitansky did not do clinical practice of surgery but
instead introduced the concept that pathologists should
confine themselves to making diagnosis which became the
accepted role of pathologist later.
ERA OF TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND
CELLULAR PATHOLOGY (AD 1800 TO 1950s)
Up to middle of the 19th century, correlation of clinical
manifestations of disease with gross pathological findings
at autopsy became the major method of study of disease.
Sophistication in surgery led to advancement in pathology.
The anatomist-surgeons of earlier centuries got replaced
largely with surgeon-pathologists in the 19th century.
Pathology started developing as a diagnostic discipline
in later half of the 19th century with the evolution of cellular
pathology which was closely linked to technology
advancements in machinery manufacture for cutting thin
sections of tissue, improvement in microscope, and
development of chemical industry and dyes for staining.
The discovery of existence of disease-causing micro-
organisms was made by French chemist Louis Pasteur
(1822–1895), thus demolishing the prevailing theory of
spontaneous generation of disease and firmly established
germ theory of disease. Subsequently, G.H.A. Hansen
(1841–1912) in Germany identified Hansen’s bacillus as
causative agent for leprosy (Hansen’s disease) in 1873. While
the study of infectious diseases was being made, the concept
of immune tolerance and allergy emerged which formed the
basis of immunisation initiated by Edward Jenner. Ilya
Metchnikoff (1845-1916), a Russian zoologist, introduced the
existence of phenomenon of phagocytosis by human defense
cells against invading microbes.
Developments in chemical industry helped in switch over
from earlier dyes of plant and animal origin to synthetic dyes;
aniline violet being the first such synthetic dye prepared by
Perkin in 1856. This led to emergence of a viable dye industry
for histological and bacteriological purposes. The impetus for
the flourishing and successful dye industry came from the
works of numerous pioneers as under:
Paul Ehrlich (1854–1915), German physician, conferred Nobel
prize in 1908 for his work in immunology, described Ehrlich’s
test for urobilinogen using Ehrlich’s aldehyde reagent, staining
techniques of cells and bacteria, and laid the foundations of
clinical pathology (Fig. 1.5).
Christian Gram (1853–1938), Danish physician, who
developed bacteriologic staining by crystal violet.
D.L. Romanowsky (1861–1921), Russian physician, who
developed stain for peripheral blood film using eosin and
methylene blue derivatives.
Robert Koch (1843–1910), German bacteriologist who, besides
Koch’s postulate and Koch’s phenomena, developed techniques
of fixation and staining for identification of bacteria, discovered
tubercle bacilli in 1882 and cholera vibrio organism in 1883.
May-Grunwald in 1902 and Giemsa in 1914 developed blood
stains and applied them for classification of blood cells and bone
marrow cells.

Introduction to Pathology
Sir William Leishman (1865–1926) who described Leishman’s
stain for blood films in 1914 and observed Leishman-Donovan
bodies (LD bodies) in leishmaniasis.
Robert Feulgen (1884–1955) who described Feulgen reaction
for DNA staining and laid the foundations of cytochemistry and
histochemistry.
Simultaneous technological advances in machinery
manufacture led to development and upgradation of
microtomes for obtaining thin sections of organs and tissues
for staining by dyes for enhancing detailed study of sections.
Though the presence of cells in thin sections of non-living
object cork had been first demonstrated much earlier by Robert
Hooke in 1667, it was revived as a unit of living matter in the
19th century by F.T. Schwann (1810–1882), the first
neurohistologist, and Claude Bernarde (1813–1878), pioneer in
pathophysiology.
Until the end of the 19th century, the study of morbid
anatomy had remained largely autopsy-based and thus had
remained a retrospective science. Rudolf Virchow (1821–1905) in
Germany is credited with the beginning of microscopic
examination of diseased tissue at cellular level and thus began
histopathology as a method of investigation. Virchow gave two
major hypotheses:
All cells come from other cells.
Disease is an alteration of normal structure and function of
these cells.
Virchow came to be referred as Pope in pathology in Europe
and is aptly known as the ‘father of cellular pathology’
(Fig. 1.6). Thus, sound foundation of diagnostic pathology had
been laid which was followed and promoted by numerous
brilliant successive workers. Thus, knowledge and skill gained
by giving accurate diagnosis on postmortem findings started
being applied to surgical biopsy and thus emerged the discipline
of surgical pathology. Virchow also described etiology of
embolism (Virchow’s triad—slowing of blood-stream, changes
in the vessel wall, changes in the blood itself), metastatic spread
of tumours (Virchow’s lymph node), and components and
diseases of blood (fibrinogen, leukocytosis, leukaemia).
The concept of frozen section examination when the
patient was still on the operation table was introduced by
Virchow’s student, Julius Cohnheim (1839–1884). In fact,
during the initial period of development of surgical
pathology around the turn of the 19th century, frozen
section was considered more acceptable by the surgeons.
Then there was the period when morphologic examination
of cells by touch imprint smears was favoured for diagnostic
purposes than actual tissue sections. Subsequently, further
advances in surgical pathology were made possible by
improved machinery and development of dyes and stains.
The concept of surgeon and physician doubling up in
the role of pathologist which started in the 19th century
continued as late as the middle of the 20th century in most
clinical departments. Assigning biopsy pathology work to
some faculty member in the clinical department was
common practice; that is why some of the notable
pathologists of the first half of 20th century had background
of clinical training e.g. James Ewing (1866–1943), A.P. Stout
(1885–1967) and Lauren Ackerman (1905–1993) in US, Pierre
Masson (1880–1958) in France, and RA Willis in Australia.
A few other landmarks in further evolution of modern
pathology in this era are as follows:
Karl Landsteiner (1863–1943) described the existence of
major human blood groups in 1900 and was awarded Nobel
prize in 1930 and is considered father of blood transfusion
(Fig.  1.7).
Ruska and Lorries in 1933 developed electron microscope
which aided the pathologist to view ultrastructure of cell
and its organelles.
The development of exfoliative cytology for early
detection of cervical cancer began with George N. Papanicolaou
(1883–1962), a Greek-born American pathologist, in 1930s
who is known as ‘father of exfoliative cytology’ (Fig. 1.8).

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
Another pioneering contribution in pathology in the
20th century was by an eminent teacher-author, William
Boyd (1885–1979), psychiatrist-turned pathologist, whose
textbooks—‘Pathology for Surgeons’ (first edition 1925) and
‘Textbook of Pathology’ (first edition 1932), dominated and
inspired the students of pathology all over the world due
to his flowery language and lucid style for about 50 years
till 1970s (Fig.  1.9). M.M. Wintrobe (1901–1986), a pupil of
Boyd who discovered haematocrit technique, regarded him
as a very stimulating teacher with keen interest in the
development of museum.
MODERN PATHOLOGY (1950s TO PRESENT TIMES)
The strides made in the latter half of 20th century until the
beginning of 21st century have made it possible to study
diseases at molecular level, and provide an evidence-based
and objective diagnosis and enable the physician to institute
appropriate therapy. The major impact of advances in
molecular biology are in the field of diagnosis and treatment
of genetic disorders, immunology and in cancer. Some of
the revolutionary discoveries during this time are as under
(Fig. 1.10):
Description of the structure of DNA of the cell by Watson
and Crick in 1953.
Identification of chromosomes and their correct number
in humans (46) by Tijo and Levan in 1956.
Identification of Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22) in
chronic myeloid leukaemia by Nowell and Hagerford in 1960
as the first chromosomal abnormality in any cancer.
In Situ Hybridization introduced in 1969 in which a
labelled probe is employed to detect and localize specific
RNA or DNA sequences ‘in situ’ (i.e. in the original place).
Recombinant DNA technique developed in 1972 using
restriction enzymes to cut and paste bits of DNA.
In 1983, Kary Mullis introduced polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) i.e. “xeroxing” DNA fragments which revolutionised
the diagnostic molecular genetics.
Flexibility and dynamism of DNA invented by Barbara
McClintock for which she was awarded Nobel prize in 1983.

Molecular structure of human chromosome.
In 1997, Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at Roslin Institute in
Edinburgh, successfully used a technique of somatic cell nuclear
transfer to create the clone of a sheep; the cloned sheep was
named Dolly. This has set in the era of mammalian cloning.
Reproductive cloning for human beings, however, is very risky
besides being absolutely unethical.
In 1998, researchers in US found a way of harvesting stem
cells, a type of primitive cells, from embryos and maintaining
their growth in the laboratory, and thus started the era of stem
cell research. Stem cells are seen by many researchers as having
virtually unlimited application in the treatment of many human

7
CHAPTER 1
Introduction to Pathology
diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, cancer, strokes,
etc. There are 2 types of sources of stem cells: embryonic stem
cells and adult stem cells. Since embryonic stem cells are more
numerous, therapeutic cloning of human embryos as a source of
stem cells for treating some incurable diseases has been allowed
in some parts of the world. A time may come when by using
embryonic stem cells, insulin-producing cells may be introduced
into the pancreas in a patient of insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus, or stem cells may be cultured in the laboratory in lieu
of a whole organ transplant. Thus, time is not far when organs
for transplant may be ‘harvested’ from the embryo in lieu of a
whole organ transplant.
In April 2003, Human Genome Project (HGP) consisting of
a consortium of countries, was completed which coincided with
50 years of description of DNA double helix by Watson and
Crick in April 1953. The sequencing of human genome reveals that
human genome contains approximately 3 billion of the base
pairs, which reside in the 23 pairs of chromosomes within the
nucleus of all human cells. Each chromosome contains an
estimated 30,000 genes in the human genome, contrary to the
earlier estimate of about 100,000 genes, which carry the
instructions for making proteins. The HGP gave us the ability
to read nature’s complete genetic blueprint for building each
human being. All this has opened new ways in treating and
researching an endless list of diseases that are currently
incurable. In time to come, medical scientists will be able to
develop highly effective diagnostic tools, to better understand
the health needs of people based on their individual genetic
make-ups, and to design new and highly effective treatments
for disease as well as suggest prevention against disease.
These inventions have set in an era of human molecular
biology which is no longer confined to research laboratories but
is ready for application as a modern diagnostic and therapeutic
tool. Modern day human molecular biology is closely linked to
information technology; the best recent example is the
availability of molecular profiling by cDNA microarrays in which
by a small silicon chip, expression of thousands of genes can be
simultaneously measured.
SUBDIVISIONS OF PATHOLOGY
After a retrospective into the historical aspects of pathology,
and before plunging into the study of diseases in the chapters
that follow, we first introduce ourselves with the branches of
human pathology.
Depending upon the species studied, there are various
disciplines of pathology such as human pathology, animal
pathology, plant pathology, veterinary pathology, poultry
pathology etc. Comparative pathology deals with the study of
diseases in animals in comparison with those found in man.
Human pathology is the largest branch of pathology. It is
conventionally divided into General Pathology dealing with
general principles of disease, and Systemic Pathology that
includes study of diseases pertaining to the specific organs and
body systems. With the advancement of diagnostic tools, the
broad principles of which are outlined in the next chapter, the
speciality of pathology has come to include the following
subspecialities:
A. HISTOPATHOLOGY. Histopathology, used synonymously
with anatomic pathology, pathologic anatomy, or morbid
anatomy, is the classic method of study and still the most
useful one which has stood the test of time. The study
includes structural changes observed by naked eye
examination referred to as gross or macroscopic changes,
and the changes detected by light and electron microscopy
supported by numerous special staining methods including
histochemical and immunological techniques to arrive at
the most accurate diagnosis. Modern time anatomic
pathology includes super-specialities such as cardiac
pathology, pulmonary pathology, neuropathology, renal
pathology, gynaecologic pathology, breast pathology,
dermatopathology, gastrointestinal pathology, oral
pathology, and so on. Anatomic pathology includes the
following 3 main subdivisions:
1.
Surgical pathology. It deals with the study of tissues
removed from the living body. It forms the bulk of tissue
material for the pathologist and includes study of tissue by
paraffin embedding techniques and by frozen section for rapid
diagnosis.
2.
Forensic pathology and autopsy work. This includes
the study of organs and tissues removed at postmortem
for medicolegal work and for determining the underlying
sequence and cause of death. By this, the pathologist
attempts to reconstruct the course of events how they may
have happened in the patient during life which culminated
in his death. Postmortem anatomical diagnosis is helpful
to the clinician to enhance his knowledge about the disease
and his judgement while forensic autopsy is helpful for
medicolegal purposes. The significance of a careful
postmortem examination can be summed up in the old
saying ‘the dead teach the living’.
3.
Cytopathology. Though a branch of anatomic
pathology, cytopathology has developed as a distinct
subspeciality in recent times. It includes study of cells shed
off from the lesions (exfoliative cytology) and fine-needle
aspiration cytology (FNAC) of superficial and deep-seated
lesions for diagnosis (Chapter 11).
B. HAEMATOLOGY. Haematology deals with the diseases
of blood. It includes laboratory haematology and clinical
haematology; the latter covers the management of patient
as well.
C. CHEMICAL PATHOLOGY. Analysis of biochemical
constituents of blood, urine, semen, CSF and other body
fluids is included in this branch of pathology.
D. IMMUNOLOGY. Detection of abnormalities in the
immune system of the body comprises immunology and
immunopathology.
E. EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY. This is defined as
production of disease in the experimental animal and its
study. However, all the findings of experimental work in
animals may not be applicable to human beings due to
species differences.
F. GEOGRAPHIC PATHOLOGY. The study of differences
in distribution of frequency and type of diseases in
populations in different parts of the world forms geographic
pathology.

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
G. MEDICAL GENETICS. This is the branch of human
genetics that deals with the relationship between heredity
and disease. There have been important developments in
the field of medical genetics e.g. in blood groups, inborn
errors of metabolism, chromosomal aberrations in
congenital malformations and neoplasms etc.
H. MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY. The detection and
diagnosis of abnormalities at the level of DNA of the cell
is included in molecular pathology. Recent advancements
in molecular biologic techniques have resulted in
availability of these methods not only for research
purposes but also as a tool in diagnostic pathology.
In conclusion, it is said that specialisation makes human
minds strangers to each other. But the above divisions of
pathology into several specialisations are quite artificial since
pathology embraces all disciplines of medicine and thus
overlapping of specialities is likely. While in the chapters that
follow, efforts have been made to present the entire subject
covering diseases of the whole human body in an integrated
and coordinated manner, knowledge is ever-expanding on a
daily basis and the quest for learning more an ongoing
process. Thus, all of us remain lifelong students of the art of
pathology of diseases!

the Study of Pathology
Chapter 2
For learning contemporary pathology effectively, it is essential
that the student is familiar with the various laboratory
methods, techniques and tools employed for the study of
pathology. This chapter is devoted to the basic aspects of
various such methods as are available in a modern pathology
laboratory—ranging from the basic microscopy to the most
recent methods.
AUTOPSY PATHOLOGY
Professor William Boyd in his unimitable style wrote
‘Pathology had its beginning on the autopsy table’. The
significance of study of autopsy in pathology is summed up
in Latin inscription in an autopsy room translated in English
as “The place where death delights to serve the living’. As
stated in the previous chapter, G.B. Morgagni in Italy (1682-
1771) and T.H.A. Laennec (1781-1826) in France started
collecting the case records of hospital cases and began
correlation of clinical features with the lesions observed at
autopsy and thus marked the beginning of clinicopathologic
correlation (CPC). CPC continues to be the most important
form of clinical teaching activity in medical institutions
worldwide.
There is still no substitute for a careful postmortem
examination which enlightens the clinician about the patho-
genesis of disease, reveals hazardous effects of therapy
administered, and settles the discrepancies finally between
antemortem and postmortem diagnosis.
Traditionally, there are two methods for carrying out
autopsy, either of which may be followed:
1.
Block extraction of abdominal and thoracic organs.
2.
In situ organ-by-organ dissection.
In conditions where multiple organs are expected to be
involved, complete autopsy should be performed. But if a
particular organ-specific disease is suspected, a mini-autopsy
or limited autopsy may be sufficient.
The study of autopsy throws new light on the knowledge
and skills of both physician as well as pathologist. The main
purposes of autopsy are as under:
1.
Quality assurance of patientcare by:
i) confirming the cause of death;
ii) establishing the final diagnosis; and
iii) study of therapeutic response to treatment.
2.
Education of the entire team involved in patientcare by:
i) making autopsy diagnosis of conditions which are often
missed clinically e.g. pneumonia, pulmonary
embolism, acute pancreatitis, carcinoma prostate;
ii) discovery of newer diseases made at autopsy e.g.
Reye’s syndrome, Legionnaire’s disease, severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS);
iii) study of demography and epidemiology of diseases;
and
iv) affords education to students and staff of pathology.
Declining autopsy rate throughout world in the recent times
is owing to the following reasons:
1.
Higher diagnostic confidence made possible by advances
in imaging techniques e.g. CT, MRI, angiography etc.
2.
Physician’s fear of legal liability on being wrong.
Continued support for advocating autopsy by caring
physicians as well as by discernible pathologists in tertiary-
care hospitals is essential for improved patientcare and
progress in medical science.
SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
The term surgical pathology is currently applied synony-
mously with histopathology, morbid anatomy, anatomic
pathology and cellular pathology. Surgical pathology is the
classic and time-tested method of tissue diagnosis made on
gross and microscopic study of tissues.
As discussed already, surgical pathology made a
beginning from pathologic study of tissues made available at
autopsy. Surgeons of old times relied solely on operative or
gross findings and, thereafter, discarded the excised tissues,
without affording an opportunity to the pathologist to make
microscopic diagnosis. However, with technology
development and advances made in the dye industry in the
initial years of 20th Century, the speciality of diagnostic
surgical pathology by biopsy developed.
In the beginning, this task was assigned to a surgeon
faculty member in the surgery departments who was
appropriately called ‘surgical pathologist’. Currently, the field
of surgical pathology has expanded so much that several
subspecialities have developed e.g. nephropathology,
neuropathology, haematopathology, dermatopathology,
gynaecologic pathology cytopathology, paediatric pathology,
and so on.
SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
Surgical pathology services in any large hospital depend
largely on inputs from surgeons and physicians familiar with
the scope and limitations inherent in the speciality. Thus it is
vital that clinician and pathologist communicate freely—
formally as well as informally, through surgical pathology
request forms, verbally, and at different fora such as tissue
committees and interdepartmental conferences.

10
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
SURGICAL PATHOLOGY PROTOCOL
REQUEST FORMS. The first and foremost task of the
clinician requesting tissue diagnosis is to send a completed
request form containing patient’s identification data (ID)
matching with that on accompanying specimen container. The
body of the request form must contain the entire relevant infor-
mation about the case and the disease (history, physical and
operative findings, results of other relevant biochemical/
haematological/radiological investigations, and clinical and
differential diagnosis) and reference to any preceding cytology
or biopsy examination done in the pathology services.
TISSUE ACCESSION. The laboratory staff receiving the
biopsy specimen must always match the ID of the patient
on the request form with that on the specimen container.
For routine tissue processing by paraffin-embedding
technique, the tissue must be put in either appropriate
fixative solution (most commonly 10% formol-saline or 10%
buffered formalin) or received fresh-unfixed. For frozen
section, the tissue is always transported fresh-unfixed.
Microwave fixation may also be used in the laboratory for
rapid fixation and processing of routine surgical specimens.
GROSS ROOM. Gross examination of the specimen received
in the laboratory is the next most important step. Proper gross
tissue cutting, gross description and selection of representative
tissue sample in larger specimens is a crucial part of the
pathologic examination of tissue submitted. Complacency at
this step cannot be remedied at a later stage and might
require taking the tissue pieces afresh if the specimen is large
enough and that may delay the report, or if the biopsy is small
and lost in processing the entire surgical procedure for
biopsy may have to be done again. Modern compact grossing
stations have inbuilt system for recording gross description
through dictaphone without the aid of an assistant to write
it. Some laboratories have a protocol of doing gross specimen
photography and specimen radiography, before and after
tissue cutting for documentation.
Calcified tissues and bone are subjected to decalcification
to remove the mineral and soften the tissue by treatment with
decalcifying agents such as acids and chelating agents (most
often aqueous nitric acid).
It is mandatory that all the gross-room personnel follow
strict precautions in handling the tissues infected with
tuberculosis, hepatitis, HIV and other viruses.
HISTOPATHOLOGY LABORATORY. Tissue cassettes
along with unique number given in the gross room to the
tissue sample is carried throughout laboratory procedures.
Majority of histopathology departments use automated tissue
processors (Fig. 2.1) having 12 separate stages completing the
cycle in about 18 hours by overnight schedule as under:
10% formalin for fixation;
ascending grades of alcohol (70%, 95% through 100%) for
dehydration for about 5 hours in 6-7 jars,
xylene/toluene/chloroform for clearing for 3 hours in two
jars; and
paraffin impregnation for 6 hours in two thermostat-fitted
waxbaths.
In order to avoid contamination of the laboratory with
vapours of formalin and alcohols, vacuum tissue processors
having closed system are also available.
Embedding of tissue is done in molten wax, blocks of
which are prepared using metallic L (Leuckhart’s) moulds.
Nowadays, plastic moulds in different colours for blocking
different biopsies are also available. The entire process of
embedding of tissues and blocking can be temperature-
controlled for which tissue embedding centres are available
(Fig. 2.2). The blocks are then trimmed followed by sectioning
by microtomy, most often by rotary microtome, employing
either fixed knife or disposable blades (Fig. 2.3).
Cryostat or frozen section eliminates all the steps of tissue
processing and paraffin-embedding. Instead, the tissue is
quickly frozen to ice at about –25°C which acts as embed-
ding medium and then sectioned (Fig. 2.4). Sections are then
ready for staining. Frozen section is a rapid intraoperative
diagnostic procedure for tissues before proceeding to a major

radical surgery. Besides, it is also used for demonstration of
certain constituents which are normally lost in processing
in alcohol or xylene e.g. fat, enzymes etc. This procedure
can be carried out in operation theatre complex near the
operating table.
Paraffin-embedded sections are routinely stained with
haematoxylin and eosin (H & E). Frozen section is stained
with rapid H & E or toluidine blue routinely. Special stains
can be employed for either of the two methods according to
need. The sections are mounted and submitted for microscopic
study.
SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT. The final and the most
important task of pathology laboratory is issuance of a
prompt, accurate, brief, and prognostically significant report.
The ideal report must contain five aspects:
i)
History (as available to the pathologist including patient’s
identity).
ii) Precise gross description.
iii) Brief microscopic findings.
iv) Morphologic diagnosis which must include the organ for
indexing purposes using SNOMED (Scientific Nomenclature
in Medicine) codes.
v) Additional comments in some cases.
QUALITY CONTROL. Monitoring the quality of output from
histopathology laboratory is important for detecting
inadequacies, updating procedures and for improving the
final report. An internal quality control by mutual discussion
in controversial cases and self-check on the quality of sections
can be carried out informally in the set up. Presently, external
quality control programme for the entire histopathology
laboratory is also available.
HISTOPATHOLOGIST AND THE LAW. Currently,
problem of allegations of negligence and malpractice in
histopathology have started coming just as with other clinical
disciplines. In equivocal biopsies and controversial cases, it
is desirable to have internal and external consultations.
Besides, the duties of sensitive reporting work should never
be delegated unless the superior is confident that the delegatee
has sufficient experience and ability.
SPECIAL STAINS (HISTOCHEMISTRY)
In H & E staining, haematoxylin stains nuclei and eosin is
used as counterstain for cytoplasm and various extracellular
material. H & E staining is routinely used to diagnose
microscopically vast majority of surgical specimens.
However, in certain ‘special’ circumstances when the
pathologist wants to demonstrate certain specific substances
or constituents of the cells to confirm etiologic, histogenic
or pathogenetic components, special stains (also termed
histochemical stains), are employed. The staining depends
upon either physical or chemical or differential solubility of
the stain with the tissues. The principles of some of the
staining procedures are well known while those of others
are unknown.
Some of the substances for which special stains are
commonly used in a surgical pathology laboratory are
amyloid, carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids,
connective tissue, microorganisms, neural tissues, pigments,
minerals; these stains are listed in Table 2.1.

ENZYME HISTOCHEMISTRY
Enzyme histochemical techniques require fresh tissues for
cryostat section and cannot be applied to paraffin-embedded
sections or formalin-fixed tissues since enzymes are damaged
rapidly. Currently, enzyme histochemistry has limited
diagnostic applications and not so popular, partly due to
requirement of fresh tissues and complex technique, and
partly due to relative lack of specificity of reaction in many
cases, and hence have been largely superseded by immuno-
histochemical procedures and molecular pathology
techniques.
Presently, some of common applications of enzyme
histochemistry in diagnostic pathology are in demonstration
of muscle related enzymes (ATPase) in myopathies,
acetylcholinesterase in diagnosis of Hirschsprung’s disease,
choloroacetate esterase for identification of myeloid cells and
mast cells, DOPA reaction for tyrosinase activity in
melanocytes, endogenous dehydrogenase (requiring
nitroblue tetrazolium or NBT) for viability of cardiac muscle,
and acid and alkaline phosphatases.
BASIC MICROSCOPY
Microscope is the basic tool of the pathologist just as is the
stethoscope for the physician and speculum for gynaecologist.
It is an instrument which produces greatly enlarged images
of minute objects.
LIGHT MICROSCOPY. The usual type of microscope used
in clinical laboratories is called light microscope. In general,
there are two types of light microscopes:
Simple microscope. This is a simple hand magnifying lens.
The magnification power of hand lens is from 2x to 200x.
Compound microscope. This has a battery of lenses which
are fitted in a complex instrument. One type of lens remains
near the object (objective lens) and another type of lens near
the observer’s eye (eye piece lens). The eyepiece and objective
lenses have different magnification. The compound
microscope can be monocular having single eyepiece or
binocular which has two eyepieces (Fig.  2.5). Multi-headed
microscopes are used as an aid to teaching and for
demonstration purposes.
VARIANTS OF LIGHT MICROSCOPY. Besides the light
microscopes, other modifications for special purposes in the
clinical laboratories are as under:
Dark ground illumination (DGI). This method is used for
examination of unstained living microorganisms e.g.
Treponema pallidum. The microorganisms are illuminated by
an oblique ray of light which does not pass through the
microorganism. The condenser is blackened in the centre and
light passes through its periphery illuminating the living
microorganism on a glass slide.
Polarising microscope. This method is used for demonstration
of birefringence e.g. amyloid, foreign body, hair etc. The light
is made plane polarised. After passing through a disc, the

14
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
rays of light vibrate in a single plane at right angle to each
other. Two discs made up of prism are placed in the path of
light, one below the object known as polariser and another
placed in the body tube which is known as analyser. The lower
disc is rotated to make the light plane polarised. .
IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE
Immunofluorescence technique is employed to localise
antigenic molecules on the cells by microscopic examination.
This is done by using specific antibody against the antigenic
molecule forming antigen-antibody complex at the specific
antigenic site which is made visible by employing a
fluorochrome which has the property to absorb radiation in
the form of ultraviolet light so as to be within the visible
spectrum of light in microscopic examination.
The immunofluorescent method has the following
essential components:
FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPE. Fluorescence microscopy
is based on the principle that the exciting radiation from
ultraviolet light of shorter wavelength (360 nm) or blue light
(wavelength 400 nm) causes fluorescence of certain substances
and thereafter re-emits light of a longer wavelength.
Some substances fluoresce naturally; this is termed
primary fluorescence or autofluorescence though UV light is
required for visualising them better e.g. vitamin A, porphyrin,
chlorophyll.
Secondary fluorescence is more commonly employed and
is the production of fluorescence on addition of dyes or chemi-
cals called fluorochromes.
Source of light. Mercury vapour and xenon gas lamps are
used as source of light for fluorescence microscopy.
Filters. A variety of filters are used between the source of
light and objective: first, heat absorbing filter; second, red-light
stop filter; and third exciter filter to allow the passage of light
of only the desired wavelength. On passing through the
specimen, light of both exciting and fluorescence wavelength
collects. Exciter light is removed by another filter called barrier
filter between the objective and the observer to protect the
observer’s eyes so that only fluorescent light reaches the eyes
of observer.
Condenser. Dark-ground condenser is used in fluorescence
microscope so that no direct light falls into the object and
instead gives dark contrast background to the fluorescence.
TECHNIQUES. There are two types of fluorescence
techniques both of which are performed on cryostat sections
of fresh unfixed tissue: direct and indirect.
In the direct technique, first introduced by Coons (1941)
who did the original work on immunofluorescence, antibody
against antigen is directly conjugated with the fluorochrome
and then examined under fluorescence microscope.
In the indirect technique, also called sandwich technique,
there is interaction between tissue antigen and specific anti-
body, followed by a step of washing and then addition of
fluorochrome for completion of reaction. Indirect
immunofluorescence technique is applied to detect auto-
antibodies in patient’s serum.
APPLICATIONS. Immunofluorescence methods are applied
for the following purposes:
1.
Detection of autoantibodies in the serum e.g. smooth muscle
antibodies (SMA), antinuclear antibodies (ANA),
antimitochondrial antibody (AMA), thyroid microsomal
antibody etc.
2.
In renal diseases for detection of deposits of immuno-
globulins, complement and fibrin in various types of
glomerular diseases by frozen section as discussed in
Chapter 22.
3.
In skin diseases to detect deposits of immunoglobulin by
frozen section, particularly at the dermo-epidermal junction
and in upper dermis e.g. in various bullous dermatosis
(Chapter 26).
4.
For study of mononuclear cell surface markers using mono-
clonal antibodies.
5.
For specific diagnosis of infective disorders e.g. viral
hepatitis.
ELECTRON MICROSCOPY
Electron microscope (EM) first developed in 1930s in Germany
has undergone modifications so as to add extensive new
knowledge to our understanding the structure and function
of normal and diseased cells at the level of cell organelles.
However, more recently, widespread use of diagnostic
immunohistochemistry in surgical pathology has restricted
the application of EM to the following areas of diagnostic
pathology:
1.
In renal pathology in conjunction with light microscopy
and immunofluorescence (Chapter 22).

4.
For research purposes.
TYPES OF EM
There are two main types of EM:
1.
Transmission electron microscope (TEM). TEM is the tool
of choice for pathologist for study of ultrastructure of cell at
organelle level. In TEM, a beam of electrons passes through
ultrathin section of tissue. The magnification obtained by TEM
is 2,000 to 10,000 times.
2.
Scanning electron microscope (SEM). SEM scans the cell
surface architecture and provides three-dimensional image.
For example, for viewing the podocytes in renal glomerulus.
Technical Aspects
Following are some of the salient technical considerations
pertaining to EM:
1.
Fixation. Whenever it is planned to undertake EM
examination of tissue, small thin piece of tissue not more than
1 mm thick should be fixed in 2-4% buffered glutaraldehyde
or in mixture of formalin and glutaraldehyde. Following
fixation, the tissue is post-fixed in buffered solution of osmium
tetroxide to enhance the contrast.
2.
Embedding. Tissue is plastic-embedded with resin on
grid.
3.
Semithin sections. First, semithin sections are cut at a
thickness of 1 μm and stained with methylene blue or
toluidine blue. Sometimes, paraffin blocks can also be cut for
EM study but generally are not quite satisfactory due to
numerous artefacts. Semithin sections guide in making the
differential diagnosis and in selecting the area to be viewed
in ultrathin sections.
4.
Ultrathin sections. For ultrastructural examination,
ultrathin sections are cut by use of diamond knife. In order to
increase electron density, thin sections may be stained by
immersing the grid in solution of lead citrate and urinyl
acetate.
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the application of immuno-
logic techniques to the cellular pathology. The technique is
used to detect the status and localisation of particular antigen
in the cells (membrane, cytoplasm or nucleus) by use of
specific antibodies which are then visualised by chromogen
as brown colour. This then helps in determining cell lineage
specifically, or is used to confirm a specific infection. IHC has
revolutionised diagnostic pathology (“brown revolution”) and
in many sophisticated laboratories IHC has replaced
histochemistry as an ancillary technique. Besides the different
principles underlying immunohistochemistry and
histochemistry, these two techniques differ in the end-result:
while histochemistry produces variety of colours for different
constituents stained depending upon the substance stained,
immunohistochemistry characteristically produces brown
colour only at the appropriate place in the cell as the end-
result for interpretation.
In the last decade, significant advances have been made
in techniques for IHC. Now, it is possible to use routinely
processed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks for IHC, thus
making profound impact on diagnostic surgical pathology.
Earlier, diagnostic surgical pathology used to be considered
a subjective science with inter-observer variation, particularly
in borderline lesions and lesions of undetermined origin, but
use of IHC has added objectivity, specificity and reproducibility
to the surgical pathologist’s diagnosis.
Overview of IHC
Evolution of IHC can be traced to immunofluorescence
methods in which antibodies labelled with fluorescent
compound could localise the specific antigen in the cryostat
section.
Need for fluorescent microscope was obviated by
subsequent development of horseradish peroxidase enzymatic
labelling technique with some colorogenic system instead of
fluorochrome so that the frozen section with labelled antibody
could be visualised by light microscopy. Chromogens
commonly used in immunohistochemical reaction are
diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) and aminoethyl
carbazole (AEC), both of which produce stable dark brown
reaction end-product.
Subsequently, immunoperoxidase technique employing
labelled antibody method to formalin-fixed paraffin sections was
developed which is now widely used.
Currently, the two most commonly used procedures in
IHC are as under:
i)
Peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) method in which PAP
reagent is pre-formed stable immune-complex which is linked
to the primary antibody by a bridging antibody.
ii) Avidin-biotin conjugate (ABC) immunoenzymatic technique
in which biotinylated secondary antibody serves to link the
primary antibody to a large preformed complex of avidin,
biotin and peroxidase.
Selection of antibody/antibodies for performing IHC
staining is done after making differential diagnosis on H & E
sections. Generally, a panel of antibodies is preferable over a
single test to avoid errors.
Antibodies for IHC are produced by polyclonal and
monoclonal (hybridoma) techniques; the latter is largely used to
produce specific high-affinity antibodies. At present, vast
number of antibodies against cell antigens for IHC stains are
available and the list is increasing at a steady rate.
IHC stains should always be done with appropriate
positive controls i.e. tissue which is known to express particular
antigen acts as a control, which may be either internal control
or separate tissue. ‘Sausage’ tissue block technique combines
the staining of multiple tissues in a single slide with a single
staining procedure and is quite economical.
For interpretation of results of IHC stains, it is important
to remember that different antigens are localised at different sites
in cells (membrane, cytoplasm or nucleus) and accordingly
positive staining is seen and interpreted at those sites e.g.

16
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
membranous staining for leucocyte common antigen (LCA),
nuclear staining for oestrogen-progesterone receptors (ER-
PR), cytoplasmic staining for smooth muscle actin (SMA) etc.
IHC stains cannot be applied to distinguish between
neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions, or between benign and
malignant tumours. These distinctions have to be done by
traditional methods in surgical pathology.
Major Applications of IHC
At present, IHC stains are used for the following purposes,
in order of diagnostic utility:
1.
Tumours of uncertain histogenesis. IHC has brought
about a revolution in approach to diagnosis of tumours of
uncertain origin, primary as well as metastatic from an
unknown primary tumour. A panel of antibodies is chosen
to resolve such diagnostic problem cases; the selection of
antibodies being made is based on clinical history,
morphologic features, and results of other relevant
investigations. Towards this, IHC stains for intermediate
filaments (keratin, vimentin, desmin, neurofilaments, and glial
fibillary acidic proteins) expressed by the tumour cells are of
immense value besides others listed in Table 2.2.
2.
Prognostic markers in cancer. The second important
application of IHC is to predict the prognosis of tumours by
detection of micrometastasis, occult metastasis, and by
identification of certain features acquired, or products
elaborated, or genes overexpressed, by the malignant cells to
predict the biologic behaviour of the tumour. These include:
proto-oncogenes (e.g. HER-2/neu overexpression in
carcinoma breast), tumour suppressor genes or antioncogenes
(e.g. Rb gene, p53), growth factor receptors (e.g. epidermal
growth factor receptor or EGFR), and tumour cell proliferation
markers (e.g. Ki67, proliferation cell nuclear antigen PCNA).
Analysis of tumours by these methods is a significant
improvement in management over the conventional
prognostic considerations by clinical staging and histologic
grading.
3.
Prediction of response to therapy. IHC is widely used to
predict therapeutic response in two important tumours—
carcinoma of the breast and prostate. Both these tumours are
under the growth regulation of hormones—oestrogen and
androgen, respectively. The specific receptors for these growth
regulating hormones are located on respective tumour cells.
Tumours expressing high level of receptor positivity would
respond favourably to removal of the endogenous source of
such hormones (oophorectomy in oestrogen-positive breast
cancer and orchiectomy in androgen-positive prostatic
carcinoma), or hormonal therapy is administered to lower
their levels: oestrogen therapy in prostatic cancer and
androgen therapy in breast cancer. The results of oestrogen-
receptors and progesterone-receptors in breast cancer have
significant prognostic correlation, though the results of
androgen-receptor studies in prostatic cancer have limited
prognostic value.
4.
Infections. IHC stains are now being applied to confirm
infectious agent in tissues by use of specific antibodies against
microbial DNA or RNA e.g. detection of viruses (HBV, CMV,
HPV, herpesviruses), bacteria (e.g. Helicobacter pylori), and
parasites (Pneumocystis carinii ) etc.
CYTOGENETICS
Applied aspects of cytogenetics have been discussed in
Chapter 10. Here, we shall concentrate on brief technical
considerations only.
Human somatic cells are diploid and contain 46 chromo-
somes: 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex
chromosomes (XX in the case of female and XY in the males).
Gametes (sperm and ova) contain 23 chromosomes and are
called haploid cells. All ova contain 23X while sperms contain
either 23X or 23Y chromosomes. Thus, the sex of the offspring
is determined by paternal chromosomal contribution i.e. if
the ovum is fertilised by X-bearing sperm, female zygote
results, while an ovum fertilised by Y-bearing sperm forms
male zygote.
Karyotyping
Karyotype is defined as the sequence of chromosomal align-
ment on the basis of size, centromeric location and banding
pattern. The structure of chromosome is described in
Chapter 3.
Determination of karyotype of an individual is an
important tool in cytogenetic analysis. Broad outlines of
karyotyping are as under:

CHAPTER 2
Techniques for the Study of Pathology
1.
Cell selection. Cells capable of growth and division are
selected for cytogenetic analysis. These include: cells from
amniotic fluid, chorionic villus (CVS) sampling, peripheral
blood lymphocytes, bone marrow, lymph node, solid tumours
etc.
2.
Cell culture. The sample so obtained is cultured in mito-
gen media. A mitogen is a substance which induces mitosis in
the cells e.g. PPD, phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), pokeweed
mitogen (PWM), phorbol ester etc. The dividing cells are
then arrested in metaphase by the addition of colchicine or
colcemid, both of which are inhibitory to microtubule
formation. Subsequently, the cells are lysed by adding
hypotonic solution.
The metaphase cells are then fixed in methanol-glacial
acetic acid mixture.
3.
Staining/banding. When stained, chromosomes have the
property of forming alternating dark and light bands. For this
purpose, fixed metaphase preparation is stained by one of
the following banding techniques:
a) Giemsa banding or G-banding, the most commonly used.
b) Quinacrine banding or Q-banding used to demonstrate
bands along chromosomes.
c)
Constitutive banding or C-banding is used to demonstrate
constitutive heterochromatin.
d) Reverse staining Giemsa banding (or R-banding) gives pattern
opposite to those obtained by G-banding.
4.
Microscopic analysis. Chromosomes are then photo-
graphed by examining the preparation under the microscope.
From the photograph, chromosomes are cut and then
arranged according to their size, centromeric location and
banding patterns. The pairs of chromosomes are identified
by the arm length of chromosomes. The centromere divides
the chromosome into a short upper arm called p arm (p for
petit in French meaning ‘short’) and a long lower arm called q
arm (letter q next to p).
Currently, molecular cytogenetic analysis and charac-
terisation of chromosomes is possible by the revolutionary
technique of multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) (vide infra under Molecular Pathology).
Applications
The field of cytogenetics has widespread applications in
diagnostic pathology (Chapter 10). In brief, karyotyping is
employed for the following purposes:
i)
Chromosomal numerical abnormalities e.g. Down’s syndrome
(trisomy 21 involving autosome 21), Klinefelter’s syndrome
(trisomy 46), Turner’s syndrome (monosomy 45, XO),
spontaneous abortions.
ii) Chromosome structural abnormalities include translocations
{e.g. Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22), cri-du-chat (5p)
syndrome, repeated spontaneous miscarriages}, deletions,
insertions, isochromosome, and ring chromosome formation.
iii) Cancer is characterised by multiple and complex chromo-
somal abnormalities which include deletions, amplifications,
inversions and translocations, especially in leukaemias and
lymphomas, germ cell tumours, some sarcomas.
DIAGNOSTIC MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY
During the last quarter of 20th Century, rapid strides have
been made in the field of molecular biology. As a result,
molecular techniques which were earlier employed for
research purposes only have now been made available for
diagnostic purposes. These techniques detect abnormalities
at the level of DNA or RNA of the cell.
Broadly speaking, all the DNA/RNA-based molecular
techniques employ hybridization (meaning joining together)
technique based on recombinant technology. Specific region
of DNA or RNA is detected by labelling it with a probe (Probe
is a chain of nucleotides consisting of certain number of known
base pairs). Probes are of different sizes and sources as under:
1.
Genomic probes derived from a region of DNA of cells.
2.
cDNA probe derived from RNA by reverse transcription.
3.
Oligonucleotide probe is a synthetic probe contrary to
genomic DNA and cDNA probe both of which are deri-
ved from cellular material.
4.
Riboprobe is prepared by in vitro transcription system.
MOLECULAR METHODS
Following is a brief account of various molecular techniques
available as diagnostic tool in surgical pathology:
1. IN SITU HYBRIDISATION. In situ hybridisation (ISH) is
a molecular hybridisation technique which allows localisation
of nucleic acid sequence directly in the intact cell (i.e. in situ)
without DNA extraction unlike other hybridisation-based
methods described below. ISH involves specific hybridisation
of a single strand of a labelled nucleic acid probe to a single
strand of complementary target DNA or RNA in the tissue.
The end-product of hybridisation is visualised by radioactive-
labelled probe (32P, 125I), or non-radioactive-labelled probe
(e.g. biotin, digoxigenin).
Applications. ISH is used for the following:
i)
In viral infections e.g. HPV, EBV, HIV, CMV, HCV etc.
ii) In human tumours for detection of gene expression and
oncogenes.
iii) In chromosomal disorders, particularly by use of fluorescent
in situ hybridisation (FISH).
2.
FILTER HYBRIDISATION. In this method, target DNA
or RNA is extracted from the tissue, which may either be fresh,
frozen and unfixed tissue, or formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded tissue. Extracted target DNA or RNA is then
immobilised on nitrocellulose filter or nylon. Hybridisation
of the target DNA is then done with labelled probe. DNA
analysis by filter hybridisation includes various methods as
under:
i)
Slot and dot blots in which the DNA sample is directly
bound to the filter without fractionation of nucleic acid size.
ii) Southern blot which is similar to dot-blot but differs in
performing prior DNA-size fractionation by gel electro-
phoresis (E.M. Southern is the name of scientist who described
Southern blot technique).
iii) Northern blot is similar to Southern blot but involves size
fractionation of RNA (Northern is, however, opposite
direction of southern and not someone’s name).

18
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
iv) Western blot is analogous to the previous two methods but
is employed for protein fractionation; in this method
antibodies are used as probes.
Applications. In view of high degree of specificity and
sensitivity of the molecular hybridisation techniques, these
techniques have widespread applications in diagnostic
pathology:
i)
In neoplasia, haematologic as well as non-haematologic.
ii) In infectious diseases for actual diagnosis of causative agent,
epidemiologic studies and identification of newer infectious
agents.
iii) In inherited genetic diseases for carrier testing, prenatal diag-
nosis and direct diagnosis of the genetic disease.
iv) In identity determination for tissue transplantation, forensic
pathology, and parentage testing.
3.
POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION. Polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) is a revolutionary technique for molecular
genetic purpose with widespread applications in diagnostics
and research. The technique is based on the principle that a
single strand of DNA has limitless capacity to duplicate itself
to form millions of copies. In PCR, a single strand of DNA
generates another by DNA polymerase using a short
complementary DNA fragment; this is done using a primer
which acts as an initiating template.
A cycle of PCR consists of three steps:
i)
Heat denaturation of DNA (at 94°C for 60-90 seconds).
ii) Annealing of the primers to their complementary
sequences (at 55°C for 30-120 seconds).
iii) Extension of the annealed primers with DNA polymerase
(at 72°C for 60-180 seconds).
Repeated cycling can be done in automated thermal cycler
and yields large accumulation of the target sequence since
each newly generated product, in turn, acts as template in
the next cycle.
Applications. PCR analysis has the same applications as for
filter hybridisation techniques and has many advantages over
them in being more rapid, can be automated by thermal
cyclers and requires much lower amount of starting DNA.
However, PCR suffers from the risk of contamination; thus
extreme caution is required in the laboratory during PCR
technique.
OTHER MODERN AIDS IN
DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY
FLOW CYTOMETRY
Flow cytometry is a modern tool used for the study of pro-
perties of cells suspended in a single moving stream. Flow
cytometry, thus, overcomes the problem of subjectivity
involved in microscopic examination of cells and tissues in
histopathology and cytopathology.
Flow cytometer has a laser-light source for fluorescence,
cell transportation system in a single stream, monochromatic
filters, lenses, mirrors and a computer for data analysis. Flow
cytometer acts like a cell sorter to physically sort out cells
from liquid suspension flowing in a single-file. Since single-
cell suspensions are required for flow cytometry, its
applications are limited to flow assays e.g. leucocytes,
erythrocytes and their precursors; body fluids, and sometimes
solid tissues homgenised to make into cell suspensions.
Applications. Flow cytometric analysis finds uses in clinical
practice in the following ways:
1.
Immunophenotyping by detailed antigenic analysis of
various haematopoietic neoplasias e.g. acute and chronic
leukaemias, lymphomas (Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s), and
plasmacytic neoplasms.
2.
Measurement of proliferation-associated antigens e.g. Ki67,
PCNA.
3.
Measurement of nucleic acid content e.g. measuring RNA
content of reticulocytes, quantifying DNA content and DNA
ploidy counts in various types of cancers.
4.
Diagnosis and prognostication of immunodeficiency e.g. in
AIDS by CD4 + T lymphocyte counts. Patients with CD4 + T
cell counts below 500/ml require antiviral treatment.
5.
To diagnose the cause of allograft rejection in renal trans-
plantation in end-stage renal disease by CD3 + T cell counts.
Patients with CD3 + T cells below 100-200/ml have lower
risk of graft rejection.
6.
Diagnosis of autoantibodies in ITP, autoimmune neutro-
penia.
METHODS FOR CELL PROLIFERATION ANALYSIS
Besides flow cytometry, the degree of proliferation of cells in
tumours can be determined by various other methods. These
include the following:
1.
Mitotic count. This is the oldest but still widely used
method in routine diagnostic pathology work. The number
of cells in mitosis are counted per high power field e.g. in
categorising various types of smooth muscle tumours.
2.
Radioautography. In this method, the proliferating cells
are labelled in vitro with thymidine and then the tissue
processed for paraffin-embedding. Thymidine-labelled cells
(corresponding to S-phase) are then counted per 2000 tumour
cell nuclei and expressed as thymidine-labelling index. The
method is employed as prognostic marker in breast
carcinoma.
3.
Microspectrophotometric analysis. The section is stained
with Feulgen reaction which imparts staining to DNA content
of the cell and then DNA content is measured by
microspectrophotometer. The method is tedious and has
limited use.
4.
Immunohistochemistry. The nuclear antigen specific for
cell growth and division is stained by immunohistochemical
method and then positive cells are counted under the
microscope or by an image analyser. Such proliferation
markers include Ki-67, PCNA, cyclins.
5.
Nucleolar organiser region (NOR). Nucleolus contains
ribosomal components which are formed at chromosomal
regions containing DNA called NORs. NORs have affinity
for silver. This property is made use in staining the section

19
CHAPTER 2
Techniques for the Study of Pathology
with silver (AgNOR technique). NORs appear as black
intranuclear dots while the background is stained yellow-
brown.
COMPUTERS IN  PATHOLOGY LABORATORY
A busy pathology laboratory has a lot of data to be
communicated to the clinicians. Pathologist too requires access
to patient’s data prior to reporting of results on specimens
received. It is, therefore, imperative that a modern pathology
laboratory has laboratory information system (LIS) which
should be ideally connected to hospital information system
(HIS).
Besides, the laboratory staff and doctors should have
adequate computer literacy on these systems.
There are two main purposes of having computers in the
laboratory:
for the billing of patients’ investigations; and
for reporting of results of tests in numeric, narrative and
graphic format.
Applications. Application of computers in the pathology
laboratory has several advantages as under:
1.
The laboratory as well as the hospital staff have access to
information pertaining to the patient which helps in improving
patientcare.
2.
The turn-around time (i.e. time between specimen collec-
tion and reporting of results) of any test is shortened.
3.
It improves productivity of laboratory staff at all levels who
can be utilised for other jobs.
4.
Coding and indexing of results and data of different tests
are possible on computer system.
5.
For research purposes and getting accreditation so as to get
grants for research, computerised data of results are
mandatory.
6.
Storage and retrieval of laboratory data to save time and space
occupied by the records.
SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM. Computer systems are
now available which can recognise and transform spoken
words of gross and microscopic description of reports through
dictaphone into text without the use of secretarial staff.
IMAGE ANALYSER AND MORPHOMETRY
Pathology is very visual subject and hence analysis of
microscopic images forms the main plank of its study. There
has been need as well as desire to impart more and more
objectivity to the rather subjective reports of histopatholgogy.
Now, with advances in computing techniques, objective
measurement of microscopic features quantitatively to impart
reproducibility in histopathology has been achieved.
Image analyser is a system that is used to perform
measurement of architectural, cellular and nuclear features
of cells. Briefly, the image analyser consists of the following:
1.
Standard light microscope with a video camera mounted
it.
2.
A computer system (CPU, monitor, key board, mouse etc)
connected to the microscope.
3.
An image capture board to convert displayed video image
on the monitor into digital image and store it in the CPU.
4.
Image analysis software installed in the computer system
according to the requirement of the user for making
measurements and calculations.
APPLICATIONS. Image analyser can be used for various
purposes as under:
1.
Morphometric study of tumour cells by measurement of
architectural, cellular and nuclear features.
2.
Quantitative nuclear DNA ploidy measurement.
3.
Quantitative valuation of immunohistochemical staining.
DNA MICROARRAYS
DNA microarray is the newer application of silicon chip
technology for simultaneous analysis of large volume of data
pertaining to human genes such as detection and
quantification of point mutation and single nuceotide
pleomorphism. The method eliminates use of DNA probes.
Instead fluorescent labelling of an array of DNA fragment
(complimentary or cDNA) is used to hybridise with target
from test sample. High resolution laser scanners are used for
detecting fluorescent signals emitted, while the level of gene
expression and genotyping of the biologic samples is
measured by application of bioinformatics.
APPLICATIONS. DNA microarrays is used for molecular
profiling of tumours which aids in arriving at specific
histogenetic diagnosis and predicting prognosis.
LASER MICRODISSECTION
Laser microdissection is another newer technique in
diagnostic surgical pathology for carrying out molecular
profiling on tissue material. It involves dissection of a single
cell or part of the cell (e.g. chromosomes) by sophisticated
laser technology and employs software for the procedure. The
isolated material can then be used for performing available
molecular tests.
TELEPATHOLOGY AND VIRTUAL MICROSCOPY
Telepathology is defined as the practice of diagnostic pathology
by a remote pathologist utilising images of tissue specimens
transmitted over a telecommunications network. The main
components of a telepathology system are as under:
Conventional light microscope.
Method of image capture, commonly a camera mounted
on light microscope.
Telecommunications link between sending and receiving
side.
Workstation at receiving end with a high quality
monitor.
Depending upon need and budget, telepathology system
is of two types:
Static (store-and-forward, passive telepathology): In this,
selected images are captured, stored and then transmitted
over the internet via e-mail attachment, file transfer protocol,
web page or CD-ROM. It is quite inexpensive and is more
common but suffers from disadvantage of having sender’s
bias in selection of transmitted images.
Dynamic (Robotic interactive telepathology): Here, the
images are transmitted in real-time from a remote

20
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
microscope. Robotic movement of stage of microscope is
controlled remotely and the desired images and fields are
accessioned from a remote/local server. Thus, it almost
duplicates to perfection the examination of actual slides
under the microscope, hence is referred to as Virtual
Microscopy. However, image quality and speed of internet
can be major hurdles.
The era of “digital pathology” in 21st Century has reached
its zenith with availability of technology for preparation
of virtual pathology slides (VPS) by high speed scanners and
then storing the scanned data in large memory output
computers. VPS stored in the memory of the computer can
then be examined and reported at any place on computer,
without having to use microscope. However, the moot
question remains whether current pathologists used to
conventional microscopy will get the same perception on
monitor. At present, this technology holds potential for
pathology education, clinical meetings and quality control.

Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations
Chapter 3
Cell Injury and
Cellular Adaptations
Chapter 3
Cells are the basic units of tissues, which form organs and
systems in the human body. Traditionally, body cells are
divided in to two main types: epithelial and mesenchymal
cells. In health, the cells remain in accord with each other. In
1859, Virchow first published cellular theory of disease,
bringing in the concept that diseases occur due to
abnormalities at the level of cells. Since then, study of
abnormalities in structure and function of cells in disease has
remained the focus of attention in understanding of diseases.
Thus, most forms of diseases begin with cell injury followed
by consequent loss of cellular function. Cell injury is defined as
a variety of stresses a cell encounters as a result of changes in its
internal and external environment.
In general, cells of the body have inbuilt mechanism to
deal with changes in environment to an extent. The cellular
response to stress may vary and depends upon the following
variables:
i)
The type of cell and tissue involved.
ii) Extent and type of cell injury.
Various forms of cellular responses to cell injury may be
as follows (Fig. 3.1):
1.
When there is increased functional demand, the cell may
adapt to the changes which are expressed morphologically
and then revert back to normal after the stress is removed
(cellular adaptations, see Fig. 3.39).
2.
When the stress is mild to moderate, the injured cell may
recover (reversible cell injury), while when the injury is
persistent cell death may occur (irreversible cell injury).
3.
The residual effects of reversible cell injury may persist
in the cell as evidence of cell injury at subcellular level
(subcellular changes), or metabolites may accumulate within
the cell (intracellular accumulations).
In order to learn the fundamentals of disease processes
at cellular level, it is essential to have an understanding of
the causes and mechanisms of cell injury and cellular
adaptations, which can be best understood in the context of
basic knowledge of normal structure and functions of cell
outlined below.
THE NORMAL CELL
Different types of cells of the body possess features which
distinguish one type from another. However, most
mammalian cells have a basic plan of common structure and
function, except the red blood cell which is devoid of nucleus
and its structure is described separately on page 288.
CELL STRUCTURE
Under normal conditions, cells are dynamic structures
existing in fluid environment. A cell is enclosed by cell
membrane that extends internally to enclose nucleus and
various subcellular organelles suspended in cytosol
(Fig. 3.2).
Cell Membrane
Electron microscopy has shown that cell membrane or
plasma membrane has a trilaminar structure having a total
thickness of about 7.5 nm and is known as unit membrane.
The three layers consist of two electron-dense layers
separated by an electronlucent layer. Biochemically, the cell
membrane is composed of complex mixture of phos-
pholipids, glycolipids, cholesterol, proteins and carbo-
hydrates. These layers are in a gel-like arrangement and are
in a constant state of flux. The outer surface of some types of
cells shows a coat of mucopolysaccharide forming a fuzzy
layer called glycocalyx. Proteins and glycoproteins of the cell
membrane may act as antigens (e.g. blood group antigens),
or may form receptors (e.g. for viruses, bacterial products,
hormones, immunoglobulins and many enzymes). The cell
Figure 3.1

22
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
receptors are probably related to the microtubules and micro-
filaments of the underlying cytoplasm. The microtubules
connect one receptor with the next. The microfilaments are
contractile structures so that the receptor may move within
the cell membrane. Bundle of microfilaments along with
cytoplasm and protein of cell membrane may form
projections on the surface of the cell called microvilli.
Microvilli are especially numerous on the surface of
absorptive and secretory cells (e.g. small intestinal mucosa)
increasing their surface area.
In brief, the cell membrane performs the following
important functions:
i)
Selective permeability that includes diffusion, membrane
pump (sodium pump) and pinocytosis (cell drinking).
ii) Bears membrane antigens (e.g. blood group antigens,
transplantation antigen).
iii) Possesses cell receptors for cell-cell recognition and
communication.
Nucleus
The nucleus consists of an outer nuclear membrane enclosing
nuclear chromatin and nucleoli.
NUCLEAR MEMBRANE.  The nuclear membrane is the
outer envelop consisting of 2 layers of the unit membrane
which are separated by a 40-70 nm wide space. The outer
layer of the nuclear membrane is studded with ribosomes
and is continuous with endoplasmic reticulum. The two
layers of nuclear membrane at places are fused together
forming circular nuclear pores which are about 50 nm in
diameter. The nuclear membrane is crossed by  several factor
which regulate the gene expression and repair the DNA
damage as soon as it occurs.
NUCLEAR CHROMATIN. The main substance of the
nucleus is comprised by the nuclear chromatin which is in
the form of shorter pieces of thread-like structures called
chromosomes of which there are 23 pairs (46 chromosomes)
Figure 3.2
Schematic diagram of the structure of an epithelial cell.

23
CHAPTER 3
Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations
together measuring about a metre in length in a human
diploid cell. Of these, there are 22 pairs (44 chromosomes) of
autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes, either XX (female)
or XY (male). Each chromosome is composed of two
chromatids connected at the centromere to form ‘X’
configuration having variation in location of the centromere.
Depending upon the length of chromosomes and centromeric
location, 46 chromosomes are categorised into 7 groups from
A to G according to Denver classification (adopted at a meeting
in Denver, USA).
Chromosomes are composed of 3 components, each with
distinctive function. These are: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
comprising about 20%, ribonucleic acid (RNA) about 10%,
and the remaining 70% consists of nuclear proteins that
include a number of basic proteins (histones), neutral
proteins, and acid proteins. DNA of the cell is largely
contained in the nucleus. The only other place in the cell that
contains small amount of DNA is mitochondria. Nuclear
DNA along with histone nuclear proteins form bead-like
structures called nucleosomes which are studded along the
coils of DNA. Nuclear DNA carries the genetic information
that is passed via RNA into the cytoplasm for manufacture
of proteins of similar composition. During cell division, one
half of DNA molecule acts as a template for the manufacture
of the other half by the enzyme, DNA polymerase, so that
the genetic characteristics are transmitted to the next progeny
of cells (replication).
The DNA molecule as proposed by Watson and Crick in
1953 consists of two complementary polypeptide chains
forming a double helical strand which is wound spirally
around an axis composed of pentose sugar-phosphoric acid
chains. The molecule is spirally twisted in a ladder-like
pattern, the steps of which are composed of 4 nucleotide bases:
two purines (adenine and guanine, i.e. A and G) and two
pyrimidines (cytosine and thymine, i.e. C and T); however, A
pairs specifically with T while G pairs with C (Fig. 3.3). The
sequence of these nucleotide base pairs in the chain,
determines the information contained in the DNA molecule
or constitutes the genetic code. In April 2003, sequencing of
human genome was completed which revealed that 23 pairs
of chromosomes in the nucleus of each human cell contains
approximately 3 billion base pairs, and each chromosome
contains an estimated 30,000 genes in the human genome,
which carry the instructions for making proteins.
In the interphase nucleus (i.e. between mitosis), part of
the chromatin that remains relatively inert metabolically and
appears deeply basophilic due to condensation of
chromosomes is called heterochromatin, while the part of
chromatin that is lightly stained (i.e. vesicular) due to
dispersed chromatin is called euchromatin. For example, in
lymphocytes there is predominance of heterochromatin while
the nucleus of a hepatocyte is mostly euchromatin.
NUCLEOLUS. The nucleus may contain one or more
rounded bodies called nucleoli. Nucleolus is the site of
synthesis of ribosomal RNA. Nucleolus is composed of
granules and fibrils representing newly synthesised
ribosomal RNA.
Cytosol and Organelles
The cytosol or the cytoplasm is the gel-like ground substance
in which the organelles (meaning little organs) of the cells are
suspended. These organelles are the site of major enzymatic
activities of the cell which are possibly mediated by enzymes
in the cytosol. The major organelles are the cytoskeleton,
mitochondria, ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi
apparatus, lysosomes, and microbodies or peroxisomes.
1.
CYTOSKELETON. Microfilaments, intermediate
filaments, and microtubules are responsible for maintaining
cellular form and movement and are collectively referred to
as cytoskeleton.
i)
Microfilaments are long filamentous structures having
a diameter of 6-8 nm. They are composed of contractile
proteins, actin and myosin, and diverse materials like parts
of microtubules and ribonucleoprotein fibres. Bundles of
microfilaments are especially prominent close to the plasma
membrane and form terminal web. Extension of these bundles
of microfilaments along with part of plasma membrane on
the surface of the cell form microvilli which increase the
absorptive surface of the cells.
ii) Intermediate filaments  are filamentous structures, 10 nm
in diameter, and are cytoplasmic constituent of a number of
cell types. They are composed of proteins. There are
5 principal types of intermediate filaments:
a) Cytokeratin (found in epithelial cells).
b) Desmin (found in skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscle).

e) Neurofilaments (seen in neurons of central and peripheral
nervous system).
Their main function is to mechanically integrate the cell
organelles within the cytoplasm.
iii) Microtubules are long hollow tubular structures about
25 nm in diameter. They are composed of protein, tubulin.
Cilia and flagella which project from the surface of cell are
composed of microtubules enclosed by plasma membrane
and are active in locomotion of the cells. Basal bodies present
at the base of each cilium or flagellum and centriole located
at the mitotic spindle of cells are the two other morpho-
logically similar structures composed of microtubules.
2.
MITOCHONDRIA.Mitochondria are oval structures
and are more numerous in metabolically active cells. They
are enveloped by two layers of membrane—the outer smooth
and the inner folded into incomplete septa or sheaf-like ridges
called cristae. Chemically and structurally, membranes of
mitochondria are similar to cell membrane. The inner
membrane, in addition, contains lollipop-shaped globular
structures projecting into the matrix present between the
layers of membrane. The matrix of the mitochondria contains
enzymes required in the Krebs’ cycle by which the products
of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism are oxidised to
produce energy which is stored in the form of ATP in the
lollipop-like globular structures. Mitochondria are not static
structures but undergo changes in their configuration during
energised state by alteration in the matrix and intercristal
space; the outer membrane is, however, less elastic.
Mitochondria perform the important metabolic function
of oxidative phosphorylation, and in the process generate
free radicals injurious to membranes. They also have role in
apoptosis. Mitochondria contain 37 genes out of which
13 encode for synthesising proteins. In addition,
mitochondria also have some DNA and ribosomes.
3.
RIBOSOMES. Ribosomes are spherical particles which
contain 80-85% of the cell’s RNA. They may be present in
the cytosol as ‘free’ unattached form, or in ‘bound’ form when
they are attached to membrane of endoplasmic reticulum.
They may lie as ‘monomeric units’ or as ‘polyribosomes’
when many monomeric ribosomes are attached to a linear
molecule of messenger RNA.
Ribosomes synthesise proteins by translation of
messenger RNA into peptide sequences followed by
packaging of proteins for the endoplasmic reticulum.
4.
ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM.  Endoplasmic reticulum
is composed of vesicles and intercommunicating canals. It is
composed of unit membrane which is continuous with both
nuclear membrane and the Golgi apparatus, and possibly
with the cell membrane. The main function of endoplasmic
reticulum is the manufacture of protein. Morphologically,
there are 2 forms of endoplasmic reticulum: rough (or
granular) and smooth (or agranular).
i)
Rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) is so-called because
its outer surface is rough or granular due to attached
ribosomes on it. RER is especially well-developed in cells
active in protein synthesis e.g. Russell bodies of plasma cells,
Nissl granules of nerve cells.
ii) Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) is devoid of ribosomes
on its surface. SER and RER are generally continuous with
each other. SER contains many enzymes which metabolise
drugs, steroids, cholesterol, and carbohydrates and partake
in muscle contraction.
5.
GOLGI APPARATUS.  The Golgi apparatus or Golgi
complex is generally located close to the nucleus. Morpho-
logically, it appears as vesicles, sacs or lamellae composed
of unit membrane and is continuous with the endoplasmic
reticulum. The Golgi apparatus is particularly well-
developed in exocrine glandular cells.
Its main functions are synthesis of carbohydrates and
complex proteins and packaging of proteins synthesised in
the RER into vesicles. Some of these vesicles may contain
lysosomal enzymes and specific granules such as in
neutrophils and in beta cells of the pancreatic islets.
6.
LYSOSOMES. Lysosomes are rounded to oval
membrane-bound organelles containing powerful lysosomal
digestive (hydrolytic) enzymes. There are 3 forms of
lysosomes:
i)
Primary lysosomes or storage vacuoles are formed from the
various hydrolytic enzymes synthesised by the RER and
packaged in the Golgi apparatus.
ii) Secondary lysosomes or autophagic vacuoles are formed by
fusion of primary lysosomes with the parts of damaged or
worn-out cell components.
iii) Residual bodies are indigestible materials in the lysosomes,
e.g. lipofuscin.
7.
CENTRIOLE OR  CENTROSOME. Each cell contains a
pair of centrioles in the cytoplasm close to nucleus in the
area called centrosome. Centrioles are cylindrical structure
composed of electron-dense evenly-shaped microtubules.
They perform the function of formation of cilia and
flagellae and constitute the mitotic spindle of fibrillary
protein during mitosis.
INTERCELLULAR COMMUNICATION
All cells in the body constantly exchange information with
each other to perform their functions properly. This process
is accomplished in the cells by direct cell-to-cell contact
(intercellular junctions), and by chemical agents, also called
as molecular agents or factors (molecular interactions between
cells) as under.
Intercellular Junctions
Plasma membranes of epithelial and endothelial cells, though
closely apposed physically, are separated from each other
by 20 nm wide space. These cells communicate across this
space through intercellular junctions or junctional complexes
visible under electron microscope and are of 4 types
(Fig. 3.4):
1.
Occluding junctions (Zonula occludens). These are tight
junctions situated just below the luminal margin of adjacent

25
CHAPTER 3
Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations
cells. As a result, the regions of occluding zones are
impermeable to macromolecules. The examples of occluding
zones are seen in renal tubular epithelial cells, intestinal
epithelium, and vascular endothelium in the brain
constituting blood-brain barrier.
2.
Adhering junctions (Zonula adherens).  These are located
just below the occluding zones between the adjacent cells
and are permeable to tracer particles. These zones are in
contact with actin microfilaments e.g. in small cell carcinoma
of the lung.
3.
Desmosomes (Macula densa).  These are tiny adhesion
plates present focally between the adjacent epithelial cells,
especially numerous in the epidermis. Bundles of
intermediate filaments (termed tonofilaments in the case of
epidermis) project from the intercellular desmosomes and
radiate into the cytoplasm. Hemidesmosomes are a variant
of desmosomes, occurring at the basal region of epithelial
cells between plasma membrane and the basement
membrane.
4.
Gap junctions (Nexus).  Gap junctions or nexus are the
regions on the lateral surfaces of epithelial cells where the
gap between the adjoining plasma membranes is reduced
from 20 nm to about 2 nm in width. Pits or holes are present
in the regions of gap junctions so that these regions are
permeable to small tracer particles.
Molecular Interactions between Cells
Besides having intercellular junctions, most cells
communicate at molecular level as follows:
1.
Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)
2.
Cytokines
3.
Membrane receptors
1.
CELL ADHESION MOLECULES (CAMs).  These are
chemicals which mediate the interaction between cells (cell-
cell interaction) as well as between cells and extracellular
matrix (cell-ECM interaction). The ECM is the ground
substance or matrix of connective tissue which provides
environment to the cells and consists of 3 components:
i)
fibrillar structural proteins (collagen, elastin);
ii) adhesion proteins (fibronectin, laminin, fibrillin,
osteonectin, tenacin); and
iii) molecules of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans
(heparan sulphate, chondroitin sulphate, dermatan sulphate,
keratan sulphate, hyaluronic acid).
CAMs participate in fertilisation, embryogenesis, tissue
repair, haemostasis, cell death by apoptosis and in
inflammation. CAMs may be detected on the surface of cells
as well as free in circulation. There are 5 groups of CAMs:
i) Integrins. They have alpha (or CD11*) and beta (CD18)
subunits and have a role in cell-ECM interactions and in
leucocyte-endothelial cell interaction.
ii) Cadherins. These are calcium-dependent adhesion
molecules which bindadjacent cells together and prevent
invasion of ECM by cancer cells. Various types of cadherins
include: E-cadherin (epithelial cell), N-cadherin (nerve cell),
M-cadherin (muscle cell), and P-cadherin (placenta).
iii) Selectins.Also called as lectins, these CAMs contain
lectins or lectin-like protein molecules which bind to
glycoproteins and glycolipids on the cell surface. Their major
role is in movement of leucocytes and platelets and develop
contact with endothelial cells. Selectins are of 3 types:
P-selectin (from platelets, also called CD62), E-selectin (from
endothelial cells, also named ECAM), and L-selectin (from
leucocytes, also called LCAM).
iv) Immunoglobulin superfamily. This group consists of a
variety of immunoglobulin molecules present on most cells
of the body. These partake in cell-to-cell contact through
various other CAMs and cytokines. They have a major role
in recognition and binding of immunocompetent cells. This
group includes ICAM-1,2 (intercellular adhesion molecule,
also called CD54), VCAM (vascular cell adhesion molecule,
also named CD106), NCAM (neural cell adhesion molecule).
v)CD44. The last group of adhesion molecules is a break
away from immunoglobulin superfamily. CD44 molecule
binds tohyaluronic acid and is expressed on leucocytes. It
is involved in leucocyte-endothelial interactions as well
as in cell-ECM interactions.
2.
CYTOKINES. Another way the cells may communicate
with each other is by release of peptides and other molecules
acting as paracrine function. Cytokines are soluble proteins
secreted by haemopoietic and non-haemopoietic cells in
response to various stimuli. Their main role is in activation
of immune system. Presently, about 200 cytokines have been
identified which are grouped in 6 categories:
i)
Interferons (IFN)
ii) Interleukins (IL)
iii) Tumour necrosis factor group (TNF, cachectin)
iv) Transforming growth factor (TGF)
v) Colony stimulating factor (CSF)
vi) Growth factors (e.g. platelet-derived growth factor PDGF,
epidermal growth factor EGF, fibroblast growth factor FGF,
Figure 3.4
Diagrammatic representation of the intercellular
junctions.
*CD number (for Cluster of Differentiation) is the nomenclature given to
the clone of cells which carry these molecules on their cell surface or in
their cytoplasm.

26
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
endothelial-derived growth factor EDGF, transforming
growth factor TGF).
Many of these cytokines have further subtypes as alpha,
beta, or are identified by numbers. Cytokines involved in
leucocyte-endothelial cell interaction are called chemokines
while growth factors and other cytokines are named
crinopectins.
3.
CELL MEMBRANE RECEPTORS. Cell receptors are
molecules consisting of proteins, glycoproteins or
lipoproteins and may be located on the outer cell membrane,
inside the cell, or may be trans-membranous. These receptor
molecules are synthesised by the cell itself depending upon
their requirement, and thus there may be upregulation or
downregulation of number of receptors. There are 3 main
types of receptors:
i)Enzyme-linked receptors.  These receptors are involved
incontrol of cell growth e.g. tyrosine kinase associated
receptors take part in activation of synthesis and secretion
of various hormones.
ii) Ion channels.  The activated receptor for ion exchange such
as for sodium, potassium and calcium and certain peptide
hormones, determines inward or outward movement of these
molecules.
iii) G-protein receptors. These are trans-membranous
receptors and activate phosphorylating enzymes for
metabolic and synthetic functions of cells.The activation of
adenosine monophosphate-phosphatase cycle (c-AMP) by
the G-proteins (guanosine nucleotide binding regulatory
proteins) is the most important signal system, also known
as ‘second messenger’ activation. The activated second
messenger(cyclic-AMP) then regulates other intracellular
activities.
Heat Shock Proteins and Ubiquitin
Two proteins which move molecules within the cell
cytoplasm are heat shock proteins (HSP) (also called stress
proteins) and ubiquitin (so named due to its universal presence
in the cells of the body).
HSPs. These are a variety of intracellular carrier proteins
present in most cells of the body, especially in renal tubular
epithelial cells. They normally perform the role of chaperones
(house-keeping) i.e. they direct and guide metabolic
molecules to the sites of metabolic activity e.g. protein
folding, disaggregation of protein-protein complexes and
transport of proteins into various intracellular organelles
(protein kinesis). However, in response to stresses of various
types (e.g. toxins, drugs, poisons, ischaemia), their level goes
up both inside the cell as well as they leak out into the plasma,
and hence the name stress proteins.
In experimental studies HSPs have been shown to limit
tissue necrosis in ischaemic reperfusion injury in myocardial
infarcts. In addition, they have also been shown to have a
central role in protein aggregation in amyloidosis.
Ubiquitin. This is another related stress protein which has
ubiquitous presence in human body cells. Like HSPs,
ubiquitin too directs intracellular molecules for either
degradation or for synthesis. Ubiquitin has been found to be
involved in a variety of human degenerative diseases,
especially in the nervous system in aging e.g. activation of
genes for protein synthesis in neurodegenerative diseases
such as in Alzheimer’s disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,
Parkinson’s disease.
CELL CYCLE
Multiplication of the somatic (mitosis) and germ (meiosis)
cells is the most complex of all cell functions. Mitosis is
controlled by genes which encode for release of specific
proteins molecules that promote or inhibit the process of
mitosis at different steps. Mitosis-promoting protein
molecules are cyclins A, B and E. These cyclins activate cyclin-
dependent kinases (CDKs) which act in conjunction with
cyclins.After the mitosis is complete, cyclins and CDKs are
degraded and the residues of used molecules are taken up
by cytoplasmic caretaker proteins, ubiquitin, to the
peroxisome for further degradation.
Period between the mitosis is called interphase. The cell
cycle is the phase between two consecutive divisions
(Fig. 3.5). There are 4 sequential phases in the cell cycle: G1
(gap 1) phase, S (synthesis) phase, G2 (gap 2) phase, and M
(mitotic) phase.
G1 (Pre-mitotic gap) phase is the stage when messenger
RNAs for the proteins and the proteins themselves required
for DNA synthesis (e.g. DNA polymerase) are synthesised.
The process is under control of cyclin E and CDKs.
S phase involves replication of nuclear DNA. Cyclin A and
CDKs control it.
G2 (Pre-mitotic gap) phase is the short gap phase in which
correctness of DNA synthesised is assessed. This stage is
promoted by cyclin B and CDKs.
M phase  is the stage in which process of mitosis to form two
daughter cells is completed. This occurs in 4 sequential
stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase  (acronym=
PMAT).
 Prophase. Each chromosome divides into 2 chromatids
which are held together by centromere. The centriole divides
and the two daughter centrioles move towards opposite poles
of the nucleus and the nuclear membrane disintegrates.
Metaphase. The microtubules become arranged between
the two centrioles forming spindle, while the chromosomes
line up at the equatorial plate of the spindle.
Anaphase. The centromeres divide and each set of
separated chromosomes moves towards the opposite poles
of the spindle. Cell membrane also begins to divide.
Telophase. There is formation of nuclear membrane around
each set of chromosomes and reconstitution of the nucleus.
The cytoplasm of the two daughter cells completely
separates.
G0 phase. The daughter cells may continue to remain in the
cell cycle and divide further, or may go out of the cell cycle
into resting phase, called G0 phase.
Stimulation of mitosis can be studied in a number of ways
as under:
Compensatory stimulation of mitosis by removal of part of
an organ.
Reparative stimulation of mitosis occurs when a tissue is
injured.

27
CHAPTER 3
Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations
Target organ stimulation of mitosis occurs under the
influence of specific hormones which have mitogenic effect
on cells of the target organ.
ETIOLOGY OF CELL INJURY
The cells may be broadly injured by two major ways:
A. By genetic causes
B. By acquired causes
The genetic causes of various diseases are discussed in
Chapter 10. The acquired causes of disease comprise vast
majority of common diseases afflicting mankind. Based on
underlying agent, the acquired causes of cell injury can be
further categorised as under:
1.
Hypoxia and ischaemia
2.
Physical agents
3.
Chemical agents and drugs
4.
Microbial agents
5.
Immunologic agents
6.
Nutritional derangements
7.
Aging
8.
Psychogenic diseases
9.
Iatrogenic factors
10. Idiopathic diseases.
In a given situation, more than one of the above etiologic
factors may be involved. These are briefly outlined below.
1.
HYPOXIA AND ISCHAEMIA.   Cells of different tissues
essentially require oxygen to generate energy and perform
metabolic functions. Deficiency of oxygen or hypoxia results
in failure to carry out these activities by the cells. Hypoxia is
the most common cause of cell injury. Hypoxia may result
from the following:
The most common mechanism of hypoxic cell injury is
by reduced supply of blood to cells due to interruption i.e.
ischaemia.
Figure 3.5
The cell cycle in mitosis. Premitotic phases are the G1, S and G2 phase while M (mitotic) phase is accomplished in 4 sequential
stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. On completion of cell division, two daughter cells are formed which may continue to
remain in the cell cycle or go out of it in resting phase (interphase), the G0 phase. (CDK = cyclin dependent kinase).

28
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
However, hypoxia may result from other causes as well
e.g. disorders of oxygen-carrying RBCs (e.g. anaemia, carbon
monoxide poisoning), heart diseases, lung diseases and
increased demand of tissues.
2.
PHYSICAL AGENTS. Physical agents in causation of
disease are as under:
mechanical trauma (e.g. road accidents);
thermal trauma (e.g. by heat and cold);
electricity;
radiation (e.g. ultraviolet and ionising); and
rapid changes in atmospheric pressure.
3.
CHEMICALS AND DRUGS. An ever increasing list of
chemical agents and drugs may cause cell injury. Important
examples include the following:
chemical poisons such as cyanide, arsenic, mercury;
strong acids and alkalis;
environmental pollutants;
insecticides and pesticides;
oxygen at high concentrations;
hypertonic glucose and salt;
social agents such as alcohol and narcotic drugs; and
therapeutic administration of drugs.
4.
MICROBIAL AGENTS. Injuries by microbes include
infections caused by bacteria, rickettsiae, viruses, fungi,
protozoa, metazoa, and other parasites.
Diseases caused by biologic agents are discussed in
Chapter 7.
5.
IMMUNOLOGIC AGENTS. Immunity is a ‘double-
edged sword’—it protects the host against various injurious
agents but it may also turn lethal and cause cell injury e.g.
hypersensitivity reactions;
anaphylactic reactions; and
autoimmune diseases.
Immunologic tissue injury  is discussed in Chapter 4.
6.
NUTRITIONAL DERANGEMENTS. A deficiency or an
excess of nutrients may result in nutritional imbalances.
Nutritional deficiency diseases may be due to overall
deficiency of nutrients (e.g. starvation), of protein calorie (e.g.
marasmus, kwashiorkor), of minerals (e.g. anaemia), or of
trace elements.
Nutritional excess is a problem of affluent societies
resulting in obesity, atherosclerosis, heart disease and
hypertension.
Nutritional diseases are discussed in Chapter 9.
7.AGING. Cellular aging or senescence leads to impaired
ability of the cells to undergo replication and repair, and
ultimately lead to cell death culminating in death of the
individual. This aspect is dealt at the end of this chapter.
8.
PSYCHOGENIC DISEASES. There are no specific
biochemical or morphologic changes in common acquired
mental diseases due to mental stress, strain, anxiety,
overwork and frustration e.g. depression, schizophrenia.
However, problems of drug addiction, alcoholism, and
smoking result in various organic diseases such as liver
damage, chronic bronchitis, lung cancer, peptic ulcer,
hypertension, ischaemic heart disease etc.
9.
IATROGENIC CAUSES. Although as per Hippocratic
oath, every physician is bound not to do or administer
anything that causes harm to the patient, there are some
diseases as well as deaths attributed to iatrogenic causes
(owing to physician). Examples include occurrence of disease
or death due to error in judgment by the physician and
untoward effects of administered therapy (drugs, radiation).
10. IDIOPATHIC DISEASES.  Idiopathic means “of
unknown cause”. Finally,  although so much is known about
the etiology of diseases, there still remain many diseases for
which exact cause is undetermined. For example, most
common form of hypertension (90%) is idiopathic (or
essential) hypertension. Similarly, exact etiology of many
cancers is still incompletely known.
PATHOGENESIS OF CELL INJURY
Injury to the normal cell by one or more of the above listed
etiologic agents may result in a state of reversible or
irreversible cell injury. The underlying alterations in
biochemical systems of cells for reversible and irreversible
cell injury by various agents is complex and varied. However,
in general, the following principles apply in pathogenesis of
most forms of cell injury by various agents:
1.
Type, duration and severity of injurious agent: The
extent of cellular injury depends upon type, duration and
severity of the stimulus e.g. small dose of chemical toxin or
short duration of ischaemia cause reversible cell injury while
large dose of the same chemical agent or persistent ischaemia
cause cell death.
2.
Type, status and adaptability of target cell: The type of
cell as regards its susceptibility to injury, its nutritional and
metabolic status, and adaptation of the cell to hostile
environment determine the extent of cell injury e.g. skeletal
muscle can withstand hypoxic injury for long-time while
cardiac muscle suffers irreversible cell injury after 20-30
minutes of persistent ischaemia.
3.
Underlying intracellular phenomena: Irrespective of
other factors, following essential biochemical phenomena
underlie all forms of cell injury:
i)
Mitochondrial damage causing ATP depletion.
ii) Cell membrane damage disturbing the metabolic and
trans-membrane exchanges.
iii). Release of toxic free radicals.
4.
Morphologic consequences: All forms of biochemical
changes underlying cell injury are expressed in terms of
morphologic changes. The ultrastructural changes become
apparent earlier than the light microscopic alterations. The
morphologic changes of reversible cell injury (e.g. hydropic
swelling) appear earlier than morphologic alterations in cell
death (e.g. in myocardial infarction).
The interruption of blood supply (i.e. ischaemia) and
impaired oxygen supply to the tissues (i.e. hypoxia) are
most common form of cell injury in human beings. Patho-

29
CHAPTER 3
Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations
genesis of hypoxic and ischaemic cell injury is, therefore,
described in detail below followed by brief discussion on
pathogenesis of chemical and physical (ionising radiation)
agents.
PATHOGENESIS OF ISCHAEMIC AND HYPOXIC INJURY
Ischaemia and hypoxia are the most common forms of cell
injury. Although underlying intracellular mechanisms and
ultrastructural changes involved in reversible and
irreversible cell injury by hypoxia and ischaemia depending
upon extent of hypoxia and type of cells are involved are a
continuation of the process, these mechanisms are discussed
separately below and illustrated diagrammatically in
Figs. 3.6  and 3.7:
REVERSIBLE CELL INJURY. If the ischaemia or hypoxia is
of short duration, the effects may be reversible on rapid
restoration of circulation e.g. in coronary artery occlusion,
myocardial contractility, metabolism and ultrastructure are
reversed if the circulation is quickly restored. The sequential
biochemical and ultrastructural changes in reversible cell
injury are as under (Fig. 3.7,A):
1.
Decreased generation of cellular ATP: Damage by
ischaemia versushypoxia  from other  causes.All living cells
require continuous supply of oxygen to produce ATP which
is essentially required for a variety of cellular functions (e.g.
membrane transport, protein synthesis, lipid synthesis and
phospholipid metabolism). ATP in human cell is derived
from 2 sources:
firstly, by aerobic respiration or oxidative phosphorylation
(which requires oxygen) in the mitochondria, and
secondly, cells may switch over to anaerobic glycolytic
oxidation to maintain constant supply of ATP (in which ATP
is generated from glucose/glycogen in the absence of
oxygen).
Ischaemia due to interruption in blood supply as well as
hypoxia from other causes limit the supply of oxygen to the
cells, thus causing decreased ATP generation from ADP:
In ischaemia, aerobic respiration as well as glucose availa-
bility are both compromised resulting in more severe and
faster effects of cell injury. Ischaemic cell injury also causes
accumulation of metabolic waste products in the cells.
On the other hand, in hypoxia from other causes (RBC
disorders, heart disease, lung disease), anaerobic glycolytic
ATP generation continues, and thus cell injury is less severe.
However, highly specialised cells such as myocardium,
proximal tubular cells of the kidney, and neurons of the CNS
are dependent solely on aerobic respiration for ATP
generation and thus these tissues suffer from ill-effects of
ischaemia more severely and rapidly.
2.
Intracellular lactic acidosis:Nuclear clumping.  Due to
low oxygen supply to the cell, aerobic respiration by
Figure 3.6
Sequence of events in the pathogenesis of reversible and irreversible cell injury caused by hypoxia/ischaemia.

30
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
mitochondria fails first. This is followed by switch to
anaerobic glycolytic pathway for the requirement of energy
(i.e. ATP). This results in rapid depletion of glycogen and
accumulation of lactic acid lowering the intracellular pH.
Early fall in intracellular pH (i.e. intracellular lactic acidosis)
results in clumping of nuclear chromatin.
3.
Damage to plasma membrane pumps: Hydropic
swelling and other membrane changes. Lack of ATP
interferes in generation of phospholipids from the cellular
fatty acids which are required for continuous repair of
membranes. This results in damage to membrane pumps
operating for regulation of sodium and calcium as under:
i) Failure of sodium-potassium pump. Normally, the energy
(ATP)-dependent sodium pump (Na+-K+ ATPase) operating
at the plasma membrane allows active transport of sodium
out of the cell and diffusion of potassium into the cell.
Lowered ATP in the cell and consequent increased ATPase
activity interfere with this membrane-regulated process. This
results in intracellular accumulation of sodium and diffusion
of potassium out of cell. The accumulation of sodium in the
cell leads to increase in intracellular water to maintain iso-
osmotic conditions (i.e. hydropic swelling occurs, discussed
later in the chapter).
ii) Failure of calcium pump. Membrane damage causes
disturbance in the calcium ion exchange across the cell
membrane. Excess of calcium moves into the cell (i.e. calcium
influx), particularly in the mitochondria, causing its swelling
and deposition of phospholipid-rich amorphous densities.
Ultrastructural evidence of reversible cell membrane
damage is seen in the form of loss of microvilli,
intramembranous particles and focal projections of the
cytoplasm (blebs). Myelin figures may be seen lying in the
cytoplasm or present outside the cell, these are derived from
membranes (plasma or organellar) enclosing water and
dissociated lipoproteins between the lamellae of injured
membranes.
4.
Reduced protein synthesis: Dispersed ribosomes. As a
result of continued hypoxia, membranes of endoplasmic
reticulum and Golgi apparatus swell up. Ribosomes are
detached from granular endoplasmic reticulum and
polysomes are degraded to monosomes, thus dispersing
ribosomes in the cytoplasm and inactivating their function.
Similar reduced protein synthesis occurs in Golgi apparatus.
Up to this point, withdrawal of acute stress that resulted
in reversible cell injury can restore the cell to normal state.
IRREVERSIBLE CELL INJURY. Persistence of ischaemia or
hypoxia results in irreversible damage to the structure and
function of the cell (cell death). The stage at which this point
of no return or irreversibility is reached from reversible cell
injury is unclear but the sequence of events is a continuation
of reversibly injured cell. Two essential phenomena always
distinguish irreversible from reversible cell injury(Fig. 3.6):
Inability of the cell to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction
on reperfusion or reoxygenation.
Disturbance in cell membrane function in general, and in
plasma membrane in particular.
In addition, there is further reduction in ATP, continued
depletion of proteins, reduced intracellular pH, and leakage
of lysosomal enzymes into the cytoplasm. These biochemical
changes have effects on the ultrastructural components of
the cell (Fig. 3.7):
1.
Calcium influx: Mitochondrial damage. As a result of
continued hypoxia, a large cytosolic influx of calcium ions
occurs, especially after reperfusion of irreversibly injured cell.
Excess intracellular calcium collects in the mitochondria
disabling its function. Morphologically, mitochondrial
changes are vacuoles in the mitochondria and deposits of
amorphous calcium salts in the mitochondrial matrix.
2.
Activated phospholipases: Membrane damage.  Damage
to membrane function in general, and plasma membrane in
particular, is the most important event in irreversible cell
injury in ischaemia. As a result of sustained ischaemia, there
is increased cytosolic influx of calcium in the cell. Increased
calcium activates endogenous phospholipases. These in turn
degrade membrane phospholipids progressively which are
the main constituent of the lipid bilayer membrane. Besides,
there is also decreased replacement-synthesis of membrane
phospholipids due to reduced ATP. Other lytic enzyme
which is activated is ATPase which causes further depletion
of ATP.
3.
Intracellular proteases: Cytoskeletal damage. The
normal cytoskeleton of the cell (microfilaments, microtubules
and intermediate filaments) which anchors the cell
membrane is damaged due to degradation by activated
intracellular proteases or by physical effect of cell swelling
producing irreversible cell membrane injury.
4. Activated endonucleases: Nuclear damage.  The
nucleoproteins are damaged by the activated lysosomal
enzymes such as proteases and endonucleases. Irreversible
damage  to the nucleus can be in three forms:
i) Pyknosis: Condensation and clumping of nucleus which
becomes dark basophilic.
ii) Karyorrhexis: Nuclear fragmentation in to small bits
dispersed in the cytoplasm.
iii) Karyolysis: Dissolution of the nucleus.
5.
Lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes: Lysosomal damage, cell
death and phagocytosis.  The lysosomal membranes are
damaged and result in escape of lysosomal hydrolytic
enzymes. These enzymes are activated due to lack of oxygen
in the cell and acidic pH. These hydrolytic enzymes include:
hydrolase, RNAase, DNAase, protease, glycosidase, phos-
phatase, lipase, amylase, cathepsin etc) which on activation
bring about enzymatic digestion of cellular components and
hence cell death. The dead cell is eventually replaced by
masses of phospholipids called myelin figures which are either
phagocytosed by macrophages or there may be formation of
calcium soaps.
Liberated enzymes just mentioned leak across the
abnormally permeable cell membrane into the serum, the
estimation of which may be used as clinical parameters of
cell death. For example, in myocardial infarction, estimation
of elevated serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT),
lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), isoenzyme of creatine kinase
(CK-MB), and more recently cardiac troponins (cTn) are
useful guides for death of heart muscle. Some of the common
enzyme markers of cell death in different forms of cell death
are given in Table 3.1.

CHAPTER 3
Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations
While cell damage from oxygen deprivation by above
mechanisms develops slowly, taking several minutes to
hours, the cell injury is accentuated after restoration of blood
supply and subsequent events termed ischaemic-reperfusion
injury and liberation of toxic free radicals, discussed below.
Ischaemia-Reperfusion Injury and
Free Radical-Mediated Cell Injury
Depending upon the duration of ischaemia/hypoxia,
restoration of blood flow may result in the following
3 different consequences:
Figure 3.7
Ultrastructural changes during cell injury due to hypoxia-ischaemia.

32
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
1.
From ischaemia to reversible injury. When the period of
ischaemia is of short duration, reperfusion with resupply of
oxygen restores the structural and functional state of the
injured cell i.e. reversible cell injury.
2.
From ischaemia to reperfusion injury. When ischaemia is
for longer duration, then rather than restoration of structure
and function of the cell, reperfusion paradoxically
deteriorates the already injured cell. This is termed
ischaemia-reperfusion injury.
3.
From ischaemia to irreversible injury.
 Much longer period
of ischaemia may produce irreversible cell injury during
ischaemia itself when so much time has elapsed that neither
blood flow restoration is helpful nor reperfusion injury can
develop. Cell death in such cases is not attributed to
formation of activated oxygen species. But instead, on
reperfusion there is further marked intracellular excess of
sodium and calcium ions due to persistent cell membrane
damage.
The underlying mechanism of reperfusion injury and free
radical mediated injury is complex but following three main
components are involved in it:
1.
Calcium overload.
2.
Generation of reactive oxygen radicals (superoxide, H2O2,
hydroxyl radicals).
3.
Subsequent inflammatory reaction.
These are discussed below:
1. CALCIUM OVERLOAD. Upon restoration of blood
supply, the ischaemic cell is further bathed by the blood fluid
that has more calcium ions at a time when the ATP stores of
the cell are low. This results in further calcium overload on
the already injured cells, triggering lipid peroxidation of the
membrane causing further membrane damage.
2. GENERATION OF REACTIVE OXYGEN RADICALS.
Although oxygen is the lifeline of all cells and tissues, its
molecular forms as reactive oxygen radicals or reactive
oxygen species can be most devastating for the cells. In recent
times, free radical-mediated cell injury has been extensively
studied and a brief account is given below.
Mechanism of oxygen free radical generation. Normally,
metabolism of the cell involves generation of ATP by
oxidative process in which biradical oxygen (O2) combines
with hydrogen atom (H) and in the process forms water
(H2O). This reaction of O2  to H2O involves ‘four electron
donation’ in four steps involving transfer of one electron at
each step.  Oxygen free radicals are the intermediate chemical
species having an unpaired oxygen in their outer orbit. These
are generated within mitochondrial inner membrane where
cytochrome oxidase catalyses the O2  to H2O reaction. Three
intermediate molecules of partially reduced species of oxygen
are generated depending upon the number of electrons
transferred(Fig. 3.8):
Superoxide oxygen (O’2): one electron
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2): two electrons
Hydroxyl radical (OH–): three electrons
These are generated from enzymatic and non-enzymatic
reaction as under:
1.
Superoxide (O’2): Superoxide anion O’2 may be generated
by direct auto-oxidation of O2 during mitochondrial electron
transport reaction. Alternatively, O’2 is produced
enzymatically by xanthine oxidase and cytochrome P450 in
the mitochondria or cytosol. O’2 so formed is catabolised to
produce H2O2 by superoxide dismutase (SOD).

CHAPTER 3
Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations
2.
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2): H2O2 is reduced to water
enzymatically by catalase (in the peroxisomes) and
glutathione peroxidase GSH (both in the cytosol and
mitochondria).
3.
Hydroxyl radical (OH–): OH– radical is formed by 2 ways
in biologic processes—by radiolysis of water and by reaction
of H2O2 with ferrous (Fe++) ions; the latter process is termed
as Fenton reaction.
Other oxygen free radicals.  In addition to superoxide, H2O2
and hydroxyl radicals generated during of O2  to H2O
reaction, a few other more active oxygen free  radicals which
formed in the body are as follows:
i)
Release of superoxide free radical in Fenton reaction (see
below).
ii) Nitric oxide (NO), a chemical mediator generated by
various body cells (endothelial cells, neurons, macrophages
etc), combines with superoxide and forms peroxynitrate
(ONOO) which is a potent free radical.
iii)  Halide reagent (chlorine or chloride) released in the
leucocytes reacts with superoxide and forms hypochlorous acid
(HOCl) which is a cytotoxic free radical.
iv) Exogenous sources of free radicals include some environ-
mental agents such as tobacco and industrial pollutants.
Cytotoxicity of oxygen free radicals.
 Free radicals are formed
in physiologic as well as pathologic processes. Basically,
oxygen radicals are unstable and are destroyed spon-
taneously. The rate of spontaneous destruction is determined
by catalytic action of certain enzymes such as superoxide
dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione peroxidase. The
net effect of free radical injury in physiologic and disease
states, therefore, depends upon the rate of free radical
formation and rate of their elimination.
However, if not degraded, then free radicals are highly
destructive to the cell since they have electron-free residue
and thus bind to all molecules of the cell; this is termed
oxidative stress.  Out of various free radicals, hydroxyl radical
is the most reactive species. Free radicals may produce
membrane damage by the following mechanisms (Fig. 3.9):
i)
Lipid peroxidation. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of
membrane are attacked repeatedly and severely by oxygen-
derived free radicals to yield highly destructive PUFA
radicals—lipid hydroperoxy radicals and lipid hypo-
peroxides. This reaction is termed lipid peroxidation. The
lipid peroxides are decomposed by transition metals such
as iron. Lipid peroxidation is propagated to other sites
causing widespread membrane damage and destruction of
organelles.
ii) Oxidation of proteins. Oxygen-derived free radicals cause
cell injury by oxidation of protein macromolecules of the cells,
crosslinkages of labile amino acids as well as by fragmen-
tation of polypeptides directly. The end-result is degradation
of cytosolic neutral proteases and cell destruction.
iii) DNA damage. Free radicals cause breaks in the single
strands of the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. This results
in cell injury; it may also cause malignant transformation of
cells.
iv) Cytoskeletal damage. Reactive oxygen species are also
known to interact with cytoskeletal elements and interfere
in mitochondrial aerobic phosphorylation and thus cause
ATP depletion.
Conditions with free radical injury.  Currently, oxygen-
derived free radicals have been known to play an important
role in many forms of cell injury:
i)
Ischaemic reperfusion injury
ii) Ionising radiation by causing radiolysis of water
iii) Chemical toxicity
iv) Chemical carcinogenesis
v) Hyperoxia (toxicity due to oxygen therapy)
vi) Cellular aging
vii) Killing of microbial agents
viii)  Inflammatory damage
ix) Destruction of tumour cells
x) Atherosclerosis.
Antioxidants. Antioxidants are endogenous or exogenous
substances which inactivate the free radicals. These
substances include the following:
Vitamins E, A and C (ascorbic acid)
Sulfhydryl-containing compounds e.g. cysteine and
glutathione.
Serum proteins e.g. ceruloplasmin and transferrin.
3. SUBSEQUENT INFLAMMATORY EACTION.
Ischaemia-reperfusion event is followed by inflammatory
reaction. Incoming activated neutrophils utilise oxygen
quickly (oxygen burst) and release a lot of oxygen free radicals.
Ischaemia is also associated with accumulation of precursors
of ATP, namely ADP and pyruvate, which further build-up
generation of free radicals.
Pathogenesis of Chemical Injury
Chemicals induce cell injury by one of the two mechanisms:
by direct cytotoxicity, or by conversion of chemical into
reactive metabolites.
DIRECT CYTOTOXIC EFFECTS. Some chemicals combine
with components of the cell and produce direct cytotoxicity
without requiring metabolic activation. The cytotoxic damage
is usually greatest to cells which are involved in the
metabolism of such chemicals e.g. in mercuric chloride
Figure 3.9
Mechanism of cell death by hydroxyl radical, the most
reactive oxygen species.

34
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
poisoning, the greatest damage occurs to cells of the alimen-
tary tract where it is absorbed and kidney where it is excreted.
Cyanidekills the cell by poisoning mitochondrial cyto-
chrome oxidase thus blocking oxidative phosphorylation.
Other examples of directly cytotoxic chemicals include
chemotherapeutic agents used in treatment of cancer, toxic
heavy metals such as mercury, lead and iron.
CONVERSION TO REACTIVE TOXIC METABOLITES.
This mechanism involves metabolic activation to yield
ultimate toxin that interacts with the target cells. The target
cells in this group of chemicals may not be the same cell that
metabolised the toxin. Example of cell injury by conversion
of reactive metabolites is toxic liver necrosis caused by carbon
tetrachloride (CCl4), acetaminophen (commonly used anal-
gesic and antipyretic) and bromobenzene. Cell injury by CCl4
is classic example of an industrial toxin (earlier used in dry-
cleaning industry) that produces cell injury by conversion
to a highly toxic free radical, CCl3, in the body’s drug-meta-
bolising P450 enzyme system in the liver cells. Thus, it
produces profound liver cell injury by free radical generation.
Other mechanism of cell injury includes direct toxic effect
on cell membrane and nucleus.
Pathogenesis of Physical Injury
Injuries caused by mechanical force are of medicolegal
significance. But they may lead to a state of shock. Injuries
by changes in atmospheric pressure (e.g. decompression
sickness) are detailed in Chapter 5. Radiation injury to human
by accidental or therapeutic exposure is of importance in
treatment of persons with malignant tumours as well as may
have carcinogenic influences (Chapter 8).
Killing of cells by ionising radiation is the result of direct
formation of hydroxyl radicals from radiolysis of water
(Fig. 3.10). These hydroxyl radicals damage the cell memb-
rane as well as may interact with DNA of the target cell. In
proliferating cells, there is inhibition of DNA replication and
eventual cell death by apoptosis (e.g. epithelial cells). In non-
proliferating cells there is no effect of inhibition of DNA
synthesis and in these cells there is cell membrane damage
followed by cell death by necrosis (e.g. neurons).
MORPHOLOGY OF CELL INJURY
After having discussed the molecular and biochemical
mechanisms of various forms of cell injury, we now turn to
light microscopic morphologic changes of reversible and
irreversible cell injury.
Depending upon the severity of cell injury, degree of
damage and residual effects on cells and tissues are variable.
In general, morphologic changes in various forms of cell
injury can be classified as shown in Table 3.2 and are
discussed below.
MORPHOLOGY OF REVERSIBLE CELL INJURY
In conventional description of morphologic changes, the term
degeneration has been used to denote morphology of
reversible cell injury. However, now it is realised that this
term does not provide any information on the nature of
underlying changes and thus currently more acceptable
terms of retrogressive changes or simply reversible cell injury
are applied to non-lethal cell injury.
Following morphologic forms of reversible cell injury are
included under this heading:
1.
Hydropic change (cloudy swelling, or vacuolar
degeneration)
2.
Fatty change
3.
Hyaline change
4.
Mucoid change
Hydropic Change
Hydropic change means accumulation of water within the
cytoplasm of the cell. Other synonyms used are cloudy
swelling (for gross appearance of the affected organ) and
vacuolar degeneration (due to cytoplasmic vacuolation).
ETIOLOGY. This is the commonest and earliest form of cell
injury from almost all causes. The common causes include

CHAPTER 3
Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations
acute and subacute cell injury from various etiologic agents
such as bacterial toxins, chemicals, poisons, burns, high fever,
intravenous administration of hypertonic glucose or saline
etc.
PATHOGENESIS. Cloudy swelling results from impaired
regulation of sodium and potassium at the level of cell
membrane. This results in intracellular accumulation of
sodium and escape of potassium. This, in turn, leads to rapid
flow of water into the cell to maintain iso-osmotic conditions
and hence cellular swelling occurs. In addition, influx of
calcium too occurs. Hydropic swelling is an entirely
reversible change upon removal of the injurious agent.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the affected
organ such as kidney, liver, pancreas, or heart muscle is
enlarged due to swelling. The cut surface bulges outwards
and is slightly opaque.
Microscopically, it is characterised by the following
features (Fig. 3.11):
i) The cells are swollen and the microvasculature
compressed.
ii) Small clear vacuoles are seen in the cells and hence
the term vacuolar degeneration. These vacuoles represent
distended cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum.
iii) Small cytoplasmic blebs may be seen.
iv) The nucleus may appear pale.
Hyaline Change
The word ‘hyaline’ means glassy (hyalos = glass). Hyaline is
a descriptive histologic term for glassy, homogeneous,
eosinophilic appearance of material in haematoxylin and
eosin-stained sections and does not refer to any specific
substance. Though fibrin and amyloid have hyaline appear-
ance, they have distinctive features and staining reactions
and can be distinguished from non-specific hyaline material.
Hyaline change is associated with heterogeneous pathologic
conditions. It may be intracellular or extracellular.
INTRACELLULAR HYALINE. Intracellular hyaline is
mainly seen in epithelial cells. A few examples are as follows:
1.
Hyaline droplets in the proximal tubular epithelial cells in
cases of excessive reabsorption of plasma proteins.
2.
Hyaline degeneration of rectus abdominalis muscle called
Zenker’s degeneration, occurring in typhoid fever. The
muscle loses its fibrillar staining and becomes glassy and
hyaline.
3.
Mallory’s hyaline represents aggregates of intermediate
filaments in the hepatocytes in alcoholic liver cell injury.
4.
Nuclear or cytoplasmic hyaline inclusions seen in some
viral infections.
5.
Russell’s bodies representing excessive immunoglobulins
in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of the plasma cells
(Fig. 3.12).
EXTRACELLULAR HYALINE. Extracellular hyaline is seen
in connective tissues. A few examples of extracellular hyaline
change are as under:
1.
Hyaline degeneration in leiomyomas of the uterus
(Fig. 3.13).
2.
Hyalinised old scar of fibrocollagenous tissues.
3.
Hyaline arteriolosclerosis in renal vessels in hypertension
and diabetes mellitus.
4.
Hyalinised glomeruli in chronic glomerulonephritis.
5.
Corpora amylacea are rounded masses of concentric hya-
line laminae seen in the prostate in the elderly, in the brain
and in the spinal cord in old age, and in old infarcts of the
lung.
Mucoid Change
Mucus secreted by mucous glands is a combination of
proteins complexed with mucopolysaccharides. Mucin, a
glycoprotein, is its chief constituent. Mucin is normally
produced by epithelial cells of mucous membranes and
mucous glands, as well as by some connective tissues like
in the umbilical cord. By convention, connective tissue
mucin is termed myxoid (mucus like). Both types of mucin

compressed. The nuclei of affected tubules are pale.

are stained by alcian blue. However, epithelial mucin stains
positively with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), while connective
tissue mucin is PAS negative but is stained positively with
colloidal iron.
EPITHELIAL MUCIN.  Following are some examples of
functional excess of epithelial mucin:
1.
Catarrhal inflammation of mucous membrane (e.g. of
respiratory tract, alimentary tract, uterus).
2.
Obstruction of duct leading to mucocele in the oral cavity
and gallbladder.
3.
Cystic fibrosis of the pancreas.
4.
Mucin-secreting tumours (e.g. of ovary, stomach, large
bowel etc) (Fig. 3.14) .
CONNECTIVE TISSUE  MUCIN.  A few examples of
disturbances of connective tissue mucin are as under:
1.
Mucoid or myxoid degeneration in some tumours e.g.
myxomas, neurofibromas, fibroadenoma, soft tissue
sarcomas etc(Fig. 3.15) .
2.
Dissecting aneurysm of the aorta due to Erdheim’s medial
degeneration and Marfan’s syndrome.
3.
Myxomatous change in the dermis in myxoedema.
4.
Myxoid change in the synovium in ganglion on the wrist.
SUBCELLULAR ALTERATIONS IN CELL INJURY
Certain morphologically distinct alterations at subcellular
level are noticeable in both acute and chronic forms of cell

CHAPTER 3
Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations
injury. These occur at the level of cytoskeleton, lysosomes,
endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria:
1. CYTOSKELETAL CHANGES. Components of cyto-
skeleton may show the following morphologic abnormalities:
i)
Defective microtubules:
In Chédiak-Higashi syndrome characterised by poor
phagocytic activity of neutrophils.
Poor sperm motility causing sterility.
Immotile cilia syndrome (Kartagener’s syndrome)
characterised by immotile cilia of respiratory tract and
consequent chronic infection due to defective clearance of
inhaled bacteria.
Defects in leucocyte function of phagocytes such as
migration and chemotaxis.
ii) Defective microfilaments:
In myopathies
Muscular dystrophies
iii) Accumulation of intermediate filaments: Various classes
of intermediate filaments (cytokeratin, desmin, vimentin,
glial fibrillary acidic protein, and neurofilament) may
accumulate in the cytosol. For example:
Mallory’s body or alcoholic hyaline as intracytoplasmic
eosinophilic inclusion seen in alcoholic liver disease which
is collection of cytokeratin intermediate filaments.
Neurofibrillary tangles, neurities and senile plaques in
Alzheimer’s disease are composed of neurofilaments and
paired helical filaments.
2.L YSOSOMAL CHANGES. Lysosomes contain powerful
hydrolytic enzymes. Heterophagy and autophagy are the two
ways by which lysosomes show morphologic changes of
phagocytic function.
i)
Heterophagy. Phagocytosis (cell eating) and pinocytosis
(cell drinking) are the two forms by which material from
outside is taken up by the lysosomes of cells such as
polymorphs and macrophages to form phagolysosomes. This
is termed heterophagy. Microbial agents and foreign
particulate material are eliminated by this mechanism.
ii) Autophagy. This is the process by which worn out
intracellular organelles and other cytoplasmic material form
autophagic vacuole that fuses with lysosome to form
autophagolysosome.
iii) Indigestible material. Some indigestible exogenous
particles such as carbon or endogenous substances such as
lipofuscin may persist in the lysosomes of the cells for a long
time as residual bodies.
iv) Storage diseases. As discussed in Chapter 10, a group of
lysosomal storage diseases due to hereditary deficiency of
enzymes may result in abnormal collection of metabolites in
the lysosomes of cells.
3. SER CHANGES. Hypertrophy of smooth endoplasmic
reticulum of liver cells as an adaptive change may occur in
response to prolonged use of barbiturates.
4.
MITOCHONDRIAL CHANGES. Mitochondrial injury
plays an important role in cell injury. Morphologic changes
of cell injury in mitochondria may be seen in the following
conditions:
i)
Megamitochondria. Megamitochondria consisting of
unusually big mitochondria are seen in alcoholic liver disease
and nutritional deficiency conditions.
ii) Alterations in the number of mitochondria may occur. Their
number increases in hypertrophy and decreases in atrophy.
iii) Oncocytoma in the salivary glands, thyroid and kidneys
consists of tumour cells having very large mitochondria.
iv) Myopathies having defect in mitochondria have abnormal
cristae.
INTRACELLULAR ACCUMULATIONS
Intracellular accumulation of substances in abnormal amounts
can occur within the cytoplasm (especially lysosomes) or
nucleus of the cell. This phenomenon was previously referred
to as infiltration, implying thereby that something unusual
has infiltrated the cell from outside which is not always the
case. Intracellular accumulation of the substance in mild
degree causes reversible cell injury while more severe damage
results in irreversible cell injury.
Such abnormal intracellular accumulations can be divided
into 3 groups:
i)
Accumulation of constituents of normal cell metabolism
produced in excess e.g. accumulations of lipids (fatty change,
cholesterol deposits), proteins and carbohydrates. In
addition, deposits of amyloid and urate are discussed
separately later.
ii) Accumulation of abnormal substances produced as a result
of abnormal metabolism due to lack of some enzymes e.g.
storage diseases or inborn errors of metabolism. These are
discussed in Chapter 10.
iii) Accumulation of pigments e.g. endogenous pigments under
special circumstances, and exogenous pigments due to lack
of enzymatic mechanisms to degrade the substances or
transport them to other sites.
These pathologic states are discussed below.
FATTY CHANGE (STEATOSIS)
Fatty change, steatosis or fatty metamorphosis is the
intracellular accumulation of neutral fat within parenchymal
cells. It includes the older, now abandoned, terms of fatty
degeneration and fatty infiltration because fatty change neither
necessarily involves degeneration nor infiltration. The
deposit is in the cytosol and represents an absolute increase
in the intracellular lipids. It is especially common in the liver
but may occur in other non-fatty tissues like the heart, skeletal
muscle, kidneys (lipoid nephrosis or minimum change
disease) and other organs.
Fatty Liver
Liver is the commonest site for accumulation of fat because
it plays central role in fat metabolism. Depending upon the
cause and amount of accumulation, fatty change may be mild
and reversible, or severe producing irreversible cell injury
and cell death.

38
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
ETIOLOGY. Fatty change in the liver may result from one
of the two types of causes:
1.
Conditions with excess fat (hyperlipidameia), exceeding the
capacity of the liver to metabolise it.
2.
 Liver cell  damage, when fat cannot be metabolised in it.
These causes are listed below:
1.
Conditions with excess fat:
i)
Obesity
ii) Diabetes mellitus
iii) Congenital hyperlipidaemia
2.
Liver cell damage:
i)
Alcoholic liver disease (most common)
ii) Starvation
iii) Protein calorie malnutrition
iv) Chronic illnesses (e.g. tuberculosis)
v) Acute fatty liver in late pregnancy
vi) Hypoxia (e.g. anaemia, cardiac failure)
vii) Hepatotoxins (e.g. carbon tetrachloride, chloroform,
ether, aflatoxins and other poisons)
viii) Drug-induced liver cell injury (e.g. administration of
methotrexate, steroids, CCl4, halothane anaesthetic,
tetracycline etc)
ix)  Reye’s syndrome
PATHOGENESIS. Mechanism of fatty liver depends upon
the stage at which the etiologic agent acts in the normal fat
transport and metabolism. Hence, pathogenesis of fatty liver
is best understood in the light of normal fat metabolism in
the liver (Fig. 3.16).
Lipids as free acids enter the liver cell from either of the
following 2 sources:
From diet as chylomicrons (containing triglycerides and
phospholipids) and as free fatty acids; and
From adipose tissue as free fatty acids.
Normally, besides above two sources, a small part of
fatty acids is also synthesised from acetate in the liver cells.
Most of free fatty acid is esterified to triglycerides by the
action of α-glycerophosphate and only a small part is
changed into cholesterol, phospholipids and ketone bodies.
While cholesterol, phospholipids and ketones are used in the
body, intracellular triglycerides are converted into
lipoproteins, which requires ‘lipid acceptor protein’.
Lipoproteins are released from the liver cells  into circulation
as plasma lipoproteins (LDL, VLDL).
In fatty liver, intracellular accumulation of triglycerides
can occur due to defect at one or more of the following 6
steps in the normal fat metabolism shown in Fig. 3.16:
1.
Increased entry of free fatty acids into the liver.
2.
Increased synthesis of fatty acids by the liver.
3.
Decreased conversion of fatty acids into ketone bodies
resulting in increased esterification of fatty acids to
triglycerides.
4.
Increased α-glycerophosphate causing increased
esterification of fatty acids to triglycerides.
5.
Decreased synthesis of ‘lipid acceptor protein’ resulting
in decreased formation of lipoprotein from triglycerides.
6.
Block in the excretion of lipoprotein from the liver into
plasma.
In most cases of fatty liver, one of the above mechanisms
is operating. But in the case of liver cell injury by chronic
alcoholism, many factors are implicated which includes:
increased lipolysis;
increased free fatty acid synthesis;
decreased triglyceride utilisation;
decreased fatty acid oxidation to ketone bodies; and
block in lipoprotein excretion.
Even a severe form of liver cell dysfunction may be
reversible; e.g. an alcoholic who has not developed
progressive fibrosis in the form of cirrhosis, the enlarged fatty
liver may return to normal if the person becomes teetotaller.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the liver in fatty
change is enlarged with a tense, glistening capsule and
rounded margins. The cut surface bulges slightly and is
pale-yellow to yellow and is greasy to touch (Fig. 3.17).
Microscopically, characteristic feature is the presence of
numerous lipid vacuoles in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes.
Fat in H & E stained section prepared by paraffin-
embedding technique appear non-staining vauloes
because it is dissolved in alcohol (Fig. 3.18):
i) The vacuoles are initially small and are present around
the nucleus (microvesicular).
ii) But with progression of the process, the vacuoles
become larger pushing the nucleus to the periphery of
the cells (macrovesicular).
iii) At times, the hepatocytes laden with large lipid
vacuoles may rupture and lipid vacuoles coalesce to form
fatty cysts.

in the text) can produce fatty liver by different etiologic agents.

CHAPTER 3
Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations
iv) Infrequently, lipogranulomas may appear consisting of
collections of lymphocytes, macrophages, and some multi-
nucleated giant cells.
v) Fat can be demonstrated in fresh unfixed tissue by
frozen section followed by fat stains such as Sudan dyes
(Sudan III, IV, Sudan black) and oil red O. Alternatively,
osmic acid which is a  fixative as well as a stain can be
used to demonstrate fat in the tissue.
Cholesterol Deposits
Intracellular deposits of cholesterol and its esters in macro-
phages may occur when there is hypercholesterolaemia. This
turns macrophages into foam cells. The examples are as
follows:
1.
Fibrofatty plaques of atherosclerosis (Chapter 15).
2.
Clusters of foam cells in tumour-like masses called
xanthomas and xanthelasma.
Stromal Fatty Infiltration
This form of lipid accumulation is quite different from fatty
change just described. Stromal fatty infiltration is the
deposition of mature adipose cells in the stromal connective
tissue in contrast to intracellular deposition of fat in the
parenchymal cells in fatty change. The condition occurs most
often in patients with obesity. The two commonly affected
organs are the heart and the pancreas. Thus, heart can be the
site for intramyocardial fatty change as well as epicardial
(stromal) fatty infiltration. The presence of mature adipose
cells in the stroma generally does not produce any
dysfunction. In the case of heart, stromal fatty infiltration is
associated with increased adipose tissue in the epicardium.
INTRACELLULAR ACCUMULATION OF PROTEINS
Pathologic accumulation of proteins in the cytoplasm of cells
may occur in the following conditions:
1.
In proteinuria, there is excessive renal tubular reabsorp-
tion of proteins by the proximal tubular epithelial cells which
show pink hyaline droplets in their cytoplasm. The change
is reversible so that with control of proteinuria the protein
droplets disappear.
2.
The cytoplasm of actively functioning plasma cells shows
pink hyaline inclusions called Russell’s bodies representing
synthesised immunoglobulins.
3.
In α1-antitrypsin deficiency, the cytoplasm of hepatocytes
shows eosinophilic globular deposits of a mutant protein.
4.
Mallory’s body or alcoholic hyalin in the hepatocytes is
intracellular accumulation of intermediate filaments of
cytokeratin and appear as amorphous pink masses.

parenchyma with rounded borders.

while others show multiple small vacuoles in the cytoplasm (microvesicles).

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
INTRACELLULAR ACCUMULATION OF GLYCOGEN
Conditions associated with excessive accumulation of
intracellular glycogen are as under:
1.
In diabetes mellitus, there is intracellular accumulation of
glycogen in different tissues because normal cellular uptake
of glucose is impaired. Glycogen deposits in diabetes mellitus
are seen in epithelium of distal portion of proximal convolu-
ted tubule and descending loop of Henle, in the hepatocytes,
in beta cells of pancreatic islets, and in cardiac muscle cells.
Deposits of glycogen produce clear vacuoles in the cytoplasm
of the affected cells. Best’s carmine and periodic acid-Schiff
(PAS) staining may be employed to confirm the presence of
glycogen in the cells.
2.
In glycogen storage diseases or glycogenosis, there is defec-
tive metabolism of glycogen due to genetic disorders. These
conditions along with other similar genetic disorders are
discussed in Chapter 10.
PIGMENTS
Pigments are coloured substances present in most living
beings including humans. There are 2 broad categories of
pigments: endogenous and exogenous (Table 3.3) .
A. ENDOGENOUS PIGMENTS
Endogenous pigments are either normal constituents of cells
or accumulate under special circumstances e.g. melanin,
ochronosis, haemoprotein-derived pigments, and lipofuscin.
Melanin
Melanin is the brown-black, non-haemoglobin-derived
pigment normally present in the hair, skin, choroid of the
eye, meninges and adrenal medulla. It is synthesised in the
melanocytes and dendritic cells, both of which are present
in the basal cells of the epidermis and is stored in the form of
cytoplasmic granules in the phagocytic cells called the
melanophores, present in the underlying dermis. Melano-
cytes possess the enzyme tyrosinase necessary for synthesis
of melanin from tyrosine. However, sometimes tyrosinase is
present but is not active and hence no melanin pigment is
visible. In such cases, the presence of tyrosinase can be
detected by incubation of tissue section in the solution of
dihydroxy phenyl alanine (DOPA). If the enzyme is present,
dark pigment is identified in pigment cells. This test is called
as DOPA reaction and is particularly useful in differentiating
amelanotic melanoma from other anaplastic tumours.
Various disorders of melanin pigmentation cause
generalised and localised hyperpigmentation and
hypopigmentation:
i)
Generalised hyperpigmentation:
a) In Addison’s disease, there is generalised hyper-
pigmentation of the skin, especially in areas exposed to light,
and of buccal mucosa.
b) Chloasma observed during pregnancy is the hyper-
pigmentation on the skin of face, nipples, and genitalia and
occurs under the influence of oestrogen. A similar appear-
ance may be observed in women taking oral contraceptives.
c)
In chronic arsenical poisoning, there is characteristic rain-
drop pigmentation of the skin.
ii) Focal hyperpigmentation:
a) Cäfe-au-lait spots are pigmented patches seen in
neurofibromatosis and Albright’s syndrome.
b) Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is characterised by focal peri-oral
pigmentation.
c)
Melanosis coli is pigmentation of the mucosa of the colon.
d) Melanotic tumours, both benign such as pigmented naevi
(Fig. 3.19 ), and malignant such as melanoma, are associated
with increased melanogenesis.
e) Lentigo is a pre-malignant condition in which there is focal
hyperpigmentation on the skin of hands, face, neck, and arms.
f)
Dermatopathic lymphadenitis is an example of deposition
of melanin pigment in macrophages of the lymph nodes
draining skin lesions.
iii) Generalised hypopigmentation:Albinism is an extreme
degree of generalised hypopigmentation in which tyrosinase
activity of the melanocytes is genetically defective and no
melanin is formed. Albinos have blond hair, poor vision and
severe photophobia. They are highly sensitive to sunlight.
Chronic sun exposure may lead to precancerous lesions and
squamous and basal cell cancers of the skin in such
individuals.
iv) Localised hypopigmentation:
a) Leucoderma is a form of partial albinism and is an inherited
disorder.
b) Vitiligo is local hypopigmentation of the skin and is more
common. It may have familial tendency.
c)
Acquired focal hypopigmentation can result from various
causes such as leprosy, healing of wounds, DLE, radiation
dermatitis etc.
Melanin-like Pigments
ALKAPTONURIA. This is a rare autosomal recessive
disorder in which there is deficiency of an oxidase enzyme
required for break-down of homogentisic acid which then
accumulates in the tissues and is excreted in the urine
(homogentisic aciduria). The urine of patients of
alkaptonuria, if allowed to stand for some hours in air, turns
black due to oxidation of homogentisic acid. The pigment is

melanin-like and is deposited both intracellularly and
intercellularly and is termed ochronosis, first described by
Virchow. Most commonly affected tissues are the cartilages,
capsules of joints, ligaments and tendons.
DUBIN-JOHNSON SYNDROME. Hepatocytes in patients
of Dubin-Johnson syndrome, an autosomal recessive form
of hereditary conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, contain
melain-like pigment in the cytoplasm (Chapter 21).
Haemoprotein-derived Pigments
Haemoproteins are the most important endogenous
pigments derived from haemoglobin, cytochromes and their
break-down products. For an understanding of disorders of
haemoproteins, it is essential to have knowledge of normal
iron metabolism and its transport which is described in
Chapter 12. In disordered iron metabolism and transport,
haemoprotein-derived pigments accumulate in the body.
These pigments are haemosiderin, acid haematin
(haemozoin), bilirubin, and porphyrins.
1.
HAEMOSIDERIN. Iron is stored in the tissues in 2 forms:
Ferritin, which is iron complexed to apoferritin and can
be identified by electron microscopy.
Haemosiderin, which is formed by aggregates of ferritin
and is identifiable by light microscopy as golden-yellow to
brown, granular pigment, especially within the mononuclear
phagocytes of the bone marrow, spleen and liver where
break-down of senescent red cells takes place. Haemosiderin
is ferric iron that can be demonstrated by Perl’s stain that
produces Prussian blue reaction. In this reaction, colourless
potassium ferrocyanide reacts with ferric ions of
haemosiderin to form deep blue ferric-ferrocyanide (Fig. 3.20).
Excessive storage of haemosiderin occurs in situations
when there is increased break-down of red cells, or systemic
overload of iron due to primary (idiopathic, hereditary)
haemochromatosis, and secondary (acquired) causes such as
in thalassaemia, sideroblastic anaemia, alcoholic cirrhosis,
multiple blood transfusions etc.
Accordingly, the effects of haemosiderin excess are as
under (Fig. 3.21 ):
a) Localised haemosiderosis.  This develops whenever there
is haemorrhage into the tissues. With lysis of red cells,
haemoglobin is liberated which is taken up by macrophages
where it is degraded and stored as haemosiderin. A few
examples are as under :
The changing colours of a bruise or a black eye are caused
by the pigments like biliverdin and bilirubin which are
formed during transformation of haemoglobin into
haemosiderin.
Brown induration in the lungs as a result of small haemor-
rhages as occur in mitral stenosis and left ventricular failure.
Microscopy reveals the presence of ‘heart failure cells’ which
are haemosiderin-laden alveolar macrophages.
b) Generalised (Systemic or Diffuse) haemosiderosis.
Systemic overload with iron may result in generalised
haemosiderosis. There can be two types of patterns:
Figure 3.19
Compound naevus showing clusters of benign naevus cells in the dermis as well as in lower epidermis. These cells contain
coarse, granular, brown-black melanin pigment.
Figure 3.20
Haemosiderin pigment in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes
seen as Prussian blue granules.

42
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
Parenchymatous deposition of haemosiderin occurs in the
parenchymal cells of the liver, pancreas, kidney, and heart.
Reticuloendothelial deposition occurs in the liver, spleen,
and bone marrow.
Generalised or systemic overload of iron may occur due
to following causes:
i)
Increased erythropoietic activity: In various forms of
chronic haemolytic anaemia, there is excessive break-down
ofhaemoglobin and hence iron overload. The problem is
further compounded by treating the condition with blood
transfusions (transfusional haemosiderosis) or by parenteral
iron therapy. The deposits of iron in these cases, termed as
acquired haemosiderosis, are initially in reticuloendothelial
tissues but may secondarily affect other organs.
ii) Excessive intestinal absorption of iron: A form of
haemosiderosis in which there is excessive intestinal
absorption of iron even when the intake is normal, is known
as idiopathic or hereditary haemochromatosis. It is an autosomal
dominant disease associated with much more deposits of iron
than cases of acquired haemosiderosis.It is characterised
by triad of pigmentary liver cirrhosis, pancreatic damage
resulting in diabetes mellitus, and skin pigmentation. On the
basis of the last two features, the disease has come to be
termed as bronze diabetes.
iii)  Excessive dietary intake of iron: A common example of
excessive intake of iron is Bantu’s disease in black tribals of
South Africa who conventionally brew their alcohol in cast
iron pots that serves as a rich source of additional dietary
iron. The excess of iron gets deposited in various organs
including the liver causing pigment cirrhosis.
2.
ACID HAEMATIN (HAEMOZOIN). Acid haematin or
haemozoin is a haemoprotein-derived brown-black pigment
containing haem iron in ferric form in acidic medium. But it
differs from haemosiderin because it cannot be stained by
Prussian blue (Perl’s) reaction, probably because of formation
of complex with a protein so that it is unable to react in the
stain. Haematin pigment is seen most commonly in chronic
malaria and in mismatched blood transfusions. Besides, the
malarial pigment can also be deposited in macrophages and
in the hepatocytes. Another variety of haematin pigment is
formalin pigment formed in blood-rich tissues which have been
preserved in acidic formalin solution.
3.
BILIRUBIN. Bilirubin is the normal non-iron containing
pigment present in the bile. It is derived from porphyrin ring
of the haem moiety of haemoglobin. Normal level of bilirubin
in blood is less than 1 mg/dl. Excess of bilirubin or hyper-
bilirubinaemia causes an important clinical condition called
jaundice. Normal bilirubin metabolism and pathogenesis of
jaundice are described in Chapter 21. Hyperbilirubinaemia
may be unconjugated or conjugated, and jaundice may
appear in one of the following 3 ways:
a) Prehepatic or haemolytic, when there is excessive destruc-
tion of red cells.
b) Posthepatic or obstructive, which results from obstruction
to the outflow of conjugated bilirubin.
c)
Hepatocellular that results from failure of hepatocytes to
conjugate bilirubin and inability of bilirubin to pass from
the liver to intestine.
Excessive accumulation of bilirubin pigment can be seen
in different tissues and fluids of the body, especially in the
hepatocytes, Kupffer cells and bile sinusoids. Skin and sclerae
become distinctly yellow. In infants, rise in unconjugated
bilirubin may produce toxic brain injury called kernicterus.
4.PORPHYRINS. Porphyrins are normal pigment present
in haemoglobin, myoglobin and cytochrome. Porphyria
refers to an uncommon disorder of inborn abnormality of
porphyrin metabolism. It results from genetic deficiency of
one of the enzymes required for the synthesis of haem,
resulting in excessive production of porphyrins. Often, the
genetic deficiency is precipitated by intake of some drugs.
Porphyrias are associated with excretion of intermediate
products in the urine—delta-aminolaevulinic acid, porpho-
bilinogen, uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin, and protoporphy-
rin. Porphyrias are broadly of 2 types—erythropoietic and
hepatic.
(a) Erythropoietic porphyrias. These have defective
synthesis of haem in the red cell precursors in the bone
marrow. These may be further of 2 subtypes:
Congenital erythropoietic porphyria, in which the urine is
red due to the presence of uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin.
The skin of these infants is highly photosensitive. Bones and
skin show red brown discolouration.
Erythropoietic protoporphyria, in which there is excess of
protoporphyrin but no excess of porphyrin in the urine.
(b) Hepatic porphyrias. These are more common and have
a normal erythroid precursors but have  a defect in synthesis
of haem in the liver. Its further subtypes include the
following:
Acute intermittent porphyria is characterised by acute
episodes of 3 patterns: abdominal, neurological, and psycho-
tic. These patients do not have photosensitivity. There is
excessive delta aminolaevulinic acid and porphobilinogen
in the urine.
Porphyria cutanea tarda is the most common of all
porphyrias. Porphyrins collect in the liver and small quantity
is excreted in the urine. Skin lesions are similar to those in
Figure 3.21
Effects of haemosiderosis.

variegate porphyria. Most of the patients have associated
haemosiderosis with cirrhosis which may eventually develop
into hepatocellular carcinoma.




Mixed (Variegate) porphyrias. It is rare and combines
skin photosensitivity with acute abdominal and neurological
manifestations.
Lipofuscin (Wear and  Tear Pigment)
Lipofuscin or lipochrome is yellowish-brown intracellular
lipid pigment (lipo = fat, fuscus = brown). The pigment is
often found in atrophied cells of old age and hence the name
‘wear and tear pigment’. It is seen in the myocardial fibres,
hepatocytes, Leydig cells of the testes and in neurons in senile
dementia. However, the pigment may, at times, accumulate
rapidly in different cells in wasting diseases unrelated to
aging.
By light microscopy, the pigment is coarse, golden-brown
granular and often accumulates in the central part of the
cells around the nuclei. In the heart muscle, the change is
associated with wasting of the muscle and is commonly
referred to as ‘brown atrophy’ (Fig. 3.22). The pigment
can be stained by fat stains but differs from other lipids in
being fluorescent and having acid-fastness.
By electron microscopy, lipofuscin appears as intralysoso-
mal electron-dense granules in perinuclear location. These
granules are composed of lipid-protein complexes.
Lipofuscin represents the collection of indigestible material
in the lysosomes after intracellular lipid peroxidation and is
therefore an example of residual bodies. Unlike in normal
cells, in aging or debilitating diseases the phospholipid end-
products of membrane damage mediated by oxygen free
radicals fail to get eliminated and hence are deposited as
lipofuscin pigment.
B. EXOGENOUS PIGMENTS
Exogenous pigments are the pigments introduced into the body
from outside such as by inhalation, ingestion or inoculation.
Inhaled Pigments
The lungs of most individuals, especially of those living in
urban areas due to atmospheric pollutants and of smokers,
show a large number of inhaled pigmented materials. The
most commonly inhaled substances are carbon or coal dust;
others are silica or stone dust, iron or iron oxide, asbestos
and various other organic substances. These substances may
produce occupational lung diseases called pneumoconiosis
(Chapter 17). The pigment particles after inhalation are taken
up by alveolar macrophages. Some of the pigment-laden
macrophages are coughed out via bronchi, while some settle
in the interstitial tissue of the lung and in the respiratory
bronchioles and pass into lymphatics to be deposited in the
hilar lymph nodes. Anthracosis (i.e. deposition of carbon
particles) is seen in almost every adult lung and generally
provokes no reaction of tissue injury (Fig. 3.23). However,
extensive deposition of particulate material over many years
in coal-miners’ pneumoconiosis, silicosis, asbestosis etc.
provoke low grade inflammation, fibrosis and impaired
respiratory function.
Ingested Pigments
Chronic ingestion of certain metals may produce
pigmentation. The examples are as under:
i)
Argyria is chronic ingestion of silver compounds and
results in brownish pigmentation in the skin, bowel, and
kidney.
ii) Chronic lead poisoning may produce the characteristic blue
lines on teeth at the gumline.
iii) Melanosis coli results from prolonged ingestion of certain
cathartics.
iv) Carotenaemia is yellowish-red colouration of the skin
caused by excessive ingestion of carrots which contain
carotene.
Injected Pigments (Tattooing)
Pigments like India ink, cinnabar and carbon are introduced
into the dermis in the process of tattooing where the pigment

the nuclei.

General Pathology and Basic Techniques
is taken up by macrophages and lies permanently in the
connective tissue. The examples of injected pigments are
prolonged use of ointments containing mercury, dirt left
accidentally in a wound, and tattooing by pricking the skin
with dyes.
MORPHOLOGY OF IRREVERSIBLE
CELL INJURY (CELL DEATH)
Cell death is a state of irreversible injury. It may occur in the
living body as a local or focal change (i.e. autolysis, necrosis
and apoptosis) and the changes that follow it (i.e. gangrene
and pathologic calcification), or result in end of the life
(somatic death). These pathologic processes involved in cell
death are described below.
AUTOLYSIS
Autolysis (i.e. self-digestion) is disintegration of the cell by its
own hydrolytic enzymes liberated from lysosomes. Autolysis
can occur in the living body when it is surrounded by
inflammatory reaction (vital reaction), but the term is generally
used for postmortem change in which there is complete
absence of surrounding inflammatory response. Autolysis
is rapid in some tissues rich in hydrolytic enzymes such as in
the pancreas, and gastric mucosa; intermediate in tissues like
the heart, liver and kidney; and slow in fibrous tissue.
Morphologically, autolysis is identified by homogeneous and
eosinophilic cytoplasm with loss of cellular details and
remains of cell as debris.
NECROSIS
Necrosis is defined as a localised area of death of tissue
followed by degradation of tissue by hydrolytic enzymes
liberated from dead cells; it is invariably accompanied by
inflammatory reaction.
Necrosis can be caused by various agents such as
hypoxia, chemical and physical agents, microbial agents,
immunological injury, etc. Two essential changes characterise
irreversible cell injury in necrosis of all types (Fig. 3.24,A):
i)Cell digestion by lytic enzymes. Morphologically this
change is identified as homogeneous and intensely
Figure 3.23
Anthracosis lung. There is presence of abundant coarse black carbon pigment in the septal walls and around the bronchiole.
Figure 3.24
Necrosis and apoptosis. A, Cell necrosis is identified
by homogeneous, eosinophilic cytoplasm and nuclear changes of
pyknosis, karyolysis, and karyorrhexis. B, Apoptosis consists of
condensation of nuclear chromatin and fragmentation of the cell into
membrane-bound apoptotic bodies which are engulfed by macrophages.

45
CHAPTER 3
Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations
eosinophilic cytoplasm. Occasionally, it may show
cytoplasmic vacuolation or dystrophic calcification.
ii) Denaturation of proteins. This process is morphologically
seen as characteristic nuclear changes in necrotic cell. These
nuclear changes may include: condensation of nuclear
chromatin (pyknosis) which may either undergo dissolution
(karyolysis) or fragmentation into many granular clumps
(karyorrhexis) (see Fig. 3.7).
Types of Necrosis
Morphologically, there are five types of necrosis: coagulative,
liquefaction (colliquative), caseous, fat, and fibrinoid necrosis.
1. COAGULATIVE NECROSIS. This is the most common
type of necrosis caused by irreversible focal injury, mostly
from sudden cessation of blood flow (ischaemia), and less
often from bacterial and chemical agents. The organs
commonly affected are the heart, kidney, and spleen.
Grossly, foci of coagulative necrosis in the early stage are
pale, firm, and slightly swollen. With progression, they
become more yellowish, softer, and shrunken.
Microscopically, the hallmark of coagulative necrosis is
the conversion of normal cells into their ‘tombstones’ i.e.
outlines of the cells are retained so that the cell type can
still be recognised but their cytoplasmic and nuclear
details are lost. The necrosed cells are swollen and appear
more eosinophilic than the normal, along with nuclear
changes described above. But cell digestion and lique-
faction fail to occur (c.f. liquefaction necrosis). Eventually,
the necrosed focus is infiltrated by inflammatory cells and
the dead cells are phagocytosed leaving granular debris
and fragments of cells (Fig. 3.25).
2. LIQUEFACTION (COLLIQUATIVE) NECROSIS.  Lique-
faction or colliquative necrosis occurs commonly due to
ischaemic injury and bacterial or fungal infections. It occurs
due to degradation of tissue by the action of powerful
Figure 3.25

but the outlines of tubules are still maintained. The nuclei show granular debris. The interface between viable and non-viable area shows non-
specific chronic inflammation and proliferating vessels.
hydrolytic enzymes. The common examples are infarct brain
and abscess cavity.
Grossly, the affected area is soft with liquefied centre
containing necrotic debris. Later, a cyst wall is formed.
Microscopically, the cystic space contains necrotic cell
debris and macrophages filled with phagocytosed
material. The cyst wall is formed by proliferating
capillaries, inflammatory cells, and gliosis (proliferating
glial cells) in the case of brain and proliferating fibroblasts
in the case of abscess cavity (Fig. 3.26).
3.
CASEOUS NECROSIS.  Caseous necrosis is found in the
centre of foci of tuberculous infections. It combines features
of both coagulative and liquefactive necrosis.
Grossly, foci of caseous necrosis, as the name implies,
resemble dry cheese and are soft, granular and yellowish.
This appearance is partly attributed to the histotoxic
effects of lipopolysaccharides present in the capsule of the
tubercle bacilli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Microscopically, the necrosed foci are structureless,
eosinophilic, and contain granular debris (Fig. 3.27). The
surrounding tissue shows characteristic granulomatous
inflammatory reaction consisting of epithelioid cells with
interspersed giant cells of Langhans’ or foreign body type
and peripheral mantle of lymphocytes.
4. FAT NECROSIS.  Fat necrosis is a special form of cell death
occurring at two anatomically different locations but
morphologically similar lesions. These are: following acute
pancreatic necrosis, and traumatic fat necrosis commonly in
breasts.
In the case of pancreas, there is liberation of pancreatic
lipases from injured or inflamed tissue that results in necrosis
of the pancreas as well as of the fat depots throughout the
peritoneal cavity, and sometimes, even affecting the extra-
abdominal adipose tissue.

46
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
Fat necrosis hydrolyses neutral fat present in adipose cells
into glycerol and free fatty acids. The damaged adipose cells
assume cloudy appearance. The leaked out free fatty acids
complex with calcium to form calcium soaps (saponification)
discussed later under dystrophic calcification.
Grossly, fat necrosis appears as yellowish-white and firm
deposits. Formation of calcium soaps imparts the necrosed
foci firmer and chalky white appearance.
Microscopically, the necrosed fat cells have cloudy
appearance and are surrounded by an inflammatory
reaction. Formation of calcium soaps is identified in the
tissue sections as amorphous, granular and basophilic
material (Fig. 3.28).
5. FIBRINOID NECROSIS. Fibrinoid necrosis is
characterised by deposition of fibrin-like material which
has the staining properties of fibrin. It is encountered in
various examples of immunologic tissue injury (e.g. in
immune complex vasculitis, autoimmune diseases,
Arthus reaction etc), arterioles in hypertension, peptic
ulcer etc.
Microscopically, fibrinoid necrosis is identified by
brightly eosinophilic, hyaline-like deposition in the vessel
wall. Necrotic focus is surrounded by nuclear debris of
neutrophils (leucocytoclasis) (Fig. 3.29). Local haemor-
rhage may occur due to rupture of the blood vessel.
APOPTOSIS
Apoptosis is a form of ‘coordinated and internally
programmed cell death’ having significance in a variety of
physiologic and pathologic conditions (apoptosis is a Greek

surrounding zone shows granulation tissue and gliosis.

inflammation.

CHAPTER 3
Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations
word meaning ‘falling off’ or ‘dropping off’). The term was
first introduced in 1972 as distinct from necrosis by being a
form of cell death which is controlled and regulated by the
rate of cell division; when the cell is not needed, pathway of
cell death is activated (‘cell suicide’) and is unaccompanied
by any inflammation and collateral tissue damage.
APOPTOSIS IN BIOLOGIC PROCESSES.Apoptosis is
responsible for mediating cell death in a wide variety of
physiologic and pathologic processes as under:
Physiologic Processes:
1.
Organised cell destruction in sculpting of tissues during
development of embryo.
2.
Physiologic involution of cells in hormone-dependent tissues
e.g. endometrial shedding, regression of lactating breast after
withdrawal of breast-feeding.
3.
Normal cell destruction followed by replacement
proliferation such as in intestinal epithelium.
4.
Involution of the thymus in early age.
Pathologic Processes:
1.
Cell death in tumours exposed to chemotherapeutic agents.
2.
Cell death by cytotoxic T cells in immune mechanisms such
as in graft-versus-host disease and rejection reactions.
3.
Progressive depletion of CD4+T cells in the pathogenesis
of AIDS.
4.
Cell death in viral infections e.g. formation of Councilman
bodies in viral hepatitis.
5.
Pathologic atrophy of organs and tissues on withdrawal of
stimuli e.g. prostatic atrophy after orchiectomy, atrophy of
kidney or salivary gland on obstruction of ureter or ducts,
respectively.
6.
Cell death in response to injurious agents involved in
causation of necrosis e.g. radiation, hypoxia and mild thermal
injury.
7.
In degenerative diseases of CNS e.g. in Alzheimer’s disease,
Parkinson’s disease, and chronic infective dementias.
8. Heart diseases e.g. heart failure, acute myocardial infarction
(20% necrosis and 80% apoptosis).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The characteristic
morphologic changes in apoptosis seen in histologic and
electron microscopic examination are as under (see
Fig. 3.24,B):
1.
Involvement of single cells or small clusters of cells in
the background of viable cells.
2.
The apoptotic cells are round to oval shrunken masses
of intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm (mummified cell)
containing shrunken or almost-normal organelles
(Fig. 3.30).

3.
The nuclear chromatin is condensed or fragmented
(pyknosis or karyorrehexis).
4.
The cell membrane may show convolutions or projections
on the surface.
5.
There may be formation of membrane-bound near-
spherical bodies on or around the cell called apoptotic bodies
containing compacted organelles.
6.
Characteristically, unlike necrosis, there is no acute
inflammatory reaction around apoptosis.
7.
Phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies by macrophages takes
place at varying speed. There may be swift phagocytosis,
or loosely floating apoptotic cells after losing contact, with
each other and basement membrane as single cells, or may
result in major cell loss in the tissue without significant
change in the overall tissue structure.
Techniques to identify and count apoptotic cells.
 In addition
to routine H & E stain, apoptotic cells can be identified and
counted by following methods:
1.
Staining of chromatin condensation (haematoxylin,
Feulgen, acridine orange).
2.
Flow cytometry to visualise rapid cell shrinkage.
3.
DNA changes detected by in situ techniques or by gel
electrophoresis.
4.
Annexin V as marker for apoptotic cell membrane having
phosphatidylserine on the cell exterior.
BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES. Biochemical processes
underlying the morphologic changes are as under:
1.
Proteolysis of cytoskeletal proteins.
2.
Protein-protein cross linking.
3.
Fragmentation of nuclear chromatin by activation of
nuclease.
4.
Appearance of phosphatidylserine on the outer surface
of cell membrane.
5.
In some forms of apoptosis, appearance of an adhesive
glycoprotein thrombospondin on the outer surface of
apoptotic bodies.
6.
Appearance of phosphatidylserine and thrombospondin
on the outer surface of apoptotic cell facilitates early
recognition by macrophages for phagocytosis prior to
appearance of inflammatory cells.
The contrasting features of apoptosis and necrosis are
illustrated in Fig. 3.24 and summarised in Table 3.4.
MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF APOPTOSIS. Several
physiologic and pathologic processes activate apoptosis in a
variety of ways. However, in general the following events
sum up the sequence involved in apoptosis:
1.
Initiators of apoptosis. Triggers for signalling program-
med cell death act at the cell membrane, either intra-
cellularly or extracellularly. These include the following:
i)
Withdrawal of signals required for normal cell survival
(e.g. absence of certain hormones, growth factors, cytokines).
ii) Extracellular signals triggering of programmed cell death
(e.g. activation of FAS receptor belonging to TNF-R family).
iii) Intracellular stimuli e.g. heat, radiation, hypoxia etc.
2.
Process of programmed cell death. After the cell hasbeen
initiatedinto self-destruct mode, the programme inbuilt in
the cell gets activated as under:
i)
Activation of caspases. Caspases are  a series of proteolyitc
or protein-splitting enzymes which act on nuclear proteins
and organelles containing protein components. The term
‘caspase’ is derived from: c for cystein protease; asp for
aspartic acid; and ase is used for naming an enzyme. Caspases
get activated either by coming in contact with some etiologic
agent of cell injury agent or by unknown mechanism.
ii) Activation of death receptors. Activated caspases set in
activation of FAS receptor (CD 95), a cell surface receptor
present on cytotoxic (CD 8+) T cells, belonging to the family
of tumour necrosis factor receptors (TNF-R). FAS receptor is
appropriately called a death receptor because on coming in
contact with the specific binding site on the target cell, it
activates specific growth controlling genes, BCL-2 and p53.
iii) Activation of growth controlling genes (BCL-2 and p53). BCL-
2 gene is a human counterpart of CED-9 (cell death) gene

found in programmed cell death of nematode worm
Caenorabditis elegans. BCL-2 gene family is located in the outer
mitochondrial membrane and includes both activators and
inhibitors of apoptosis. Thus, it may regulate the apoptotic
process by binding to some related proteins (e.g. to BAX and
BAD) for promoting apoptosis, or to BCL-XL for inhibiting
apoptosis. The net effect on the mitochondrial membrane is
thus based on the pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic actions
of BCL-2 gene family.
Besides BCL-2, the apoptotic pathway is partly also
governed by p53 molecule which promotes apoptosis.
iv) Cell death. The above mechanisms lead to proteolytic
actions on nucleus, chromatin clumping, cytoskeletal
damage, disruption of endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrial
damage, and disturbed cell membrane.
3.
Phagocytosis. The dead apoptotic cells develop
membrane changes which promote their phagocytosis.
Phosphatidylserine and thrombospondin molecules which
are normally present on the inside of the cell membrane,
appear on the outer surface of the cells in apoptosis, which
facilitate their identification by adjacent phagocytes and
promotes phagocytosis. The phagocytosis is unaccompanied
by any other inflammatory cells.
The mechanism of apoptosis is schematically represented
in Fig. 3.31.
GANGRENE
Gangrene is a form of necrosis of tissue with superadded
putrefaction. The type of necrosis is usually coagulative due
to ischaemia (e.g. in gangrene of the bowel, gangrene of limb).
On the other hand, gangrenous or necrotising inflammation is
characterised by primarily inflammation provoked by
virulent bacteria resulting in massive tissue necrosis. Thus,
the end-result of necrotising inflammation and gangrene is
the same but the way the two are produced, is different. The
examples of necrotising inflammation are: gangrenous
appendicitis, gangrenous stomatitis (noma, cancrum oris).
There are 2 main forms of gangrene—dry and wet, and a
variant form of wet gangrene called gas gangrene. In all types
of gangrene, necrosis undergoes liquefaction by the action
of putrefactive bacteria.
Dry Gangrene
This form of gangrene begins in the distal part of a limb due
to ischaemia. The typical example is the dry gangrene in the
toes and feet of an old patient due to arteriosclerosis. Other
causes of dry gangrene foot include thromboangiitis
obliterans (Buerger’s disease), Raynaud’s disease, trauma,
ergot poisoning. It is usually initiated in one of the toes which
is farthest from the blood supply, containing so little blood
that even the invading bacteria find it hard to grow in the
necrosed tissue. The gangrene spreads slowly upwards until
it reaches a point where the blood supply is adequate to keep
the tissue viable. A line of separation is formed at this point
between the gangrenous part and the viable part.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the affected part
is dry, shrunken and dark black, resembling the foot of a
mummy. It is black due to liberation of haemoglobin from
haemolysed red blood cells which is acted upon by
hydrogen disulfide (H2S) produced by bacteria resulting
in formation of black iron sulfide. The line of separation
usually brings about complete separation with eventual
falling off of the gangrenous tissue if it is not removed
surgically (Fig. 3.32).
Figure 3.31
Molecular mechanism of apoptosis.

50
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
Histologically, there is necrosis with smudging of the
tissue. The line of separation consists of inflammatory
granulation tissue (Fig. 3.33).
Wet Gangrene
Wet gangrene occurs in naturally moist tissues and organs
such as the mouth, bowel, lung, cervix, vulva etc. Diabetic
foot is another example of wet gangrene due to high sugar
content in the necrosed tissue which favours growth of
bacteria. Bed sores occurring in a bed-ridden patient due to
pressure on sites like the sacrum, buttocks and heels are the
other important clinical conditions included in wet gangrene.
Wet gangrene usually develops rapidly due to blockage of
venous, and less commonly, arterial blood flow from
thrombosis or embolism. The affected part is stuffed with
blood which favours the rapid growth of putrefactive
bacteria. The toxic products formed by bacteria are absorbed
causing profound systemic manifestations of septicaemia,
and finally death. The spreading wet gangrene generally
lacks clear-cut line of demarcation and may spread to
peritoneal cavity causing peritonitis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the affected part
is soft, swollen, putrid, rotten and dark. The classic
example is gangrene of bowel, commonly due to
strangulated hernia, volvulus or intussusception. The part
is stained dark due to the same mechanism as in dry
gangrene (Fig. 3.34).
Histologically, there is coagulative necrosis with stuffing
of affected part with blood. There is ulceration of the
mucosa and intense inflammatory infiltration. Lumen of
the bowel contains mucus and blood. The line of
demarcation between gangrenous segment and viable
bowel is generally not clear-cut (Fig. 3.35).
Contrasting features of two main forms of gangrene are
summarised in Table 3.5.
GAS GANGRENE. It is a special form of wet gangrene
caused by gas-forming clostridia (gram-positive anaerobic
bacteria) which gain entry into the tissues through open
contaminated wounds, especially in the muscles, or as a
complication of operation on colon which normally contains
clostridia. Clostridia produce various toxins which produce
necrosis and oedema locally and are also absorbed producing
profound systemic manifestations.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the affected area
is swollen, oedematous, painful and crepitant due to
accumulation of gas bubbles within the tissues.
Figure 3.32
Dry gangrene of the foot. The gangrenous area is dry, shrunken and dark and is separated from the viable tissue by clear line of
separation.
Figure 3.33

necrosis of the skin, muscle and other soft tissue, and thrombsed vessels.

51
CHAPTER 3
Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations
Subsequently, the affected tissue becomes dark black and
foul smelling.
Microscopically, the muscle fibres undergo coagulative
necrosis with liquefaction. Large number of gram-positive
bacilli can be identified. At the periphery, a zone of
leucocytic infiltration, oedema and congestion are found.
Capillary and venous thrombi are common.
PATHOLOGIC CALCIFICATION
Deposition of calcium salts in tissues other than osteoid or
enamel is called pathologic or heterotopic calcification. Two
distinct types of pathologic calcification are recognised:
Dystrophic calcification, which is characterised by
deposition of calcium salts in dead or degenerated tissues
with normal calcium metabolism and normal serum calcium
levels.
Metastatic calcification, on the other hand, occurs in
apparently normal tissues and is associated with deranged
calcium metabolism and hypercalcaemia.
Etiology and pathogenesis of the two are different but
morphologically the deposits in both resemble normal
minerals of the bone.
Histologically, in routine H and E stained sections,
calcium salts appear as deeply basophilic, irregular and
granular clumps. The deposits may be intracellular,
extracellular, or at both locations. Occasionally, hetero-
topic bone formation (ossification) may occur. Calcium
deposits can be confirmed by special stains like silver
impregnation method of von-Kossa producing black colour,
and alizarin red S that produces red staining. Pathologic
calcification is often accompanied by diffuse or granular
deposits of iron giving positive Prussian blue reaction in
Perl’s stain.

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
Etiopathogenesis
The two types of pathologic calcification result from distinctly
different etiologies and mechanisms.
DYSTROPHIC CALCIFICATION. As apparent from
definition, dystrophic calcification may occur due to 2 types
of causes:
Calcification in dead tissue
Calcification of degenerated tissue.
Calcification in dead tissue
1.
Caseous necrosis in tuberculosis is the most common site
for dystrophic calcification. Living bacilli may be present
even in calcified tuberculous lesions, lymph nodes, lungs,
etc (Fig. 3.36).
2.
Liquefaction necrosis in chronic abscesses may get calcified.
3.
Fat necrosis following acute pancreatitis or traumatic fat
necrosis in the breast results in deposition of calcium soaps.
4.
Gamna-Gandy bodies in chronic venous congestion (CVC)
of the spleen is characterised by calcific deposits admixed
with haemosiderin  on fibrous tissue.
5.
Infarcts may sometimes undergo dystrophic calcification.
6.
Thrombi, especially in the veins, may produce phleboliths.
7.
Haematomas in the vicinity of bones may undergo
dystrophic calcification.
8.
Dead parasites like in hydatid cyst, Schistosoma eggs, and
cysticercosis are some of the examples showing dystrophic
calcification.
9.
Calcification in breast cancer detected by mammography.
10. Congenital toxoplasmosis involving the central nervous
system visualised by calcification in the infant brain.
Calcification in degenerated tissues
1.
Dense old scars may undergo hyaline degeneration and
subsequent calcification.
2.
Atheromas in the aorta and coronaries frequently undergo
calcification.
3.
Mönckeberg’s sclerosis shows calcification in the tunica
media of muscular arteries in elderly people (Chapter 15)
(Fig.3.37) .
4.
Stroma of tumours such as uterine fibroids, breast cancer,
thyroid adenoma, goitre etc show calcification.
5.
Some tumours show characteristic spherules of calci-
fication called psammoma bodies or calcospherites such as in
meningioma, papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma of the
ovary and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.
6.
Cysts which have been present for a long time may show
calcification of their walls e.g. epidermal and pilar cysts.
7.
Calcinosis cutis is a condition of unknown cause in which
there are irregular nodular deposits of calcium salts in the
skin and subcutaneous tissue.
8.
Senile degenerative changes may be accompanied by
dystrophic calcification such as in costal cartilages, tracheal
or bronchial cartilages, and pineal gland in the brain etc.

Wet gangrene of the small bowel. Microscopy shows coagulative necrosis of the affected bowel wall and thrombosed vessels
while the junction with normal intestine is indistinct and shows an inflammatory infiltrate.

tuberculous lymph node. In H & E, the deposits are basophilic granular
while the periphery shows healed granulomas.

53
CHAPTER 3
Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations
Pathogenesis of dystrophic calcification. It is not quite clear
as to how dystrophic calcification takes place. Since serum
calcium levels are within normal limits, the denatured
proteins in necrotic or degenerated tissue bind phosphate
ions, which react with calcium ions to form precipitates of
calcium phosphate.
The process of dystrophic calcification has been likened
to the formation of normal hydroxyapatite in the bone
involving 2 phases: initiation and propagation.
Initiation is the phase in which precipitates of calcium
phosphate begin to accumulate intracellularly in the
mitochondria, or extracellularly in membrane-bound
vesicles.
Propagation is the phase in which minerals deposited in
the initiation phase are propagated to form mineral crystals.
METASTATIC CALCIFICATION.  Since metastatic calcifi-
cation occurs in normal tissues due to hypercalcaemia, its
causes would include one of the following two conditions:
Excessive mobilisation of calcium from the bone.
Excessive absorption of calcium from the gut.
Excessive mobilisation of calcium from the bone. These
causes are more common and include the following:
1.
Hyperparathyroidism which may be primary such as due
to parathyroid adenoma, or secondary such as from
parathyroid hyperplasia, chronic renal failure etc.
2.
Bony destructive lesions such as multiple myeloma,
metastatic carcinoma.
3.
Prolonged immobilisation of a patient results in disuse
atrophy of the bones and hypercalcaemia.
Excessive absorption of calcium from the gut. Less often,
excess calcium may be absorbed from the gut causing
hypercalcaemia and metastatic calcification. These causes are
as under:
1.
Hypervitaminosis D results in increased calcium
absorption.
2.
Milk-alkali syndrome caused by excessive oral intake of
calcium in the form of milk and administration of calcium
carbonate in the treatment of peptic ulcer.
3.
Hypercalcaemia of infancy is another condition in which
metastatic calcification may occur.
Sites of metastatic calcification. Metastatic calcification may
occur in any normal tissue of the body but affects the
following organs more commonly:
1.
Kidneys, especially at the basement membrane of tubular
epithelium and in the tubular lumina causing nephro-
calcinosis (Fig.3.38).
2.
Lungs, especially in the alveolar walls.
3.
Stomach, on the acid-secreting fundal glands.
4.
Blood vessels, especially on the internal elastic lamina.
5.
Cornea is another site affected by metastatic calcification.
6.
Synovium of the joint causing pain and dysfunction.
Pathogenesis of metastatic calcification.  Metasatic
calcification at the above-mentioned sites occurs due to
excessive binding of inorganic phosphate ions with calcium
ions, which are elevated due to underlying metabolic
derangement. This leads to formation of precipitates of
calcium phosphate at the preferential sites. Metastatic
calcification is reversible upon correction of underlying
metabolic disorder.
The distinguishing features between the two types of
pathologic calcification are summarised inTable 3.6.
CELLULAR ADAPTATIONS
For the sake of survival on exposure to stress, the cells make
adjustments with the changes in their environment (i.e.
adapt) to the physiologic needs (physiologic adaptation) and
to non-lethal pathologic injury (pathologic adaptation). Broadly
speaking, such physiologic and pathologic adaptations occur
by following processes (Fig. 3.39):
Decreasing or increasing their size i.e. atrophy and
hypertrophy respectively, or by increasing their number i.e.
Figure 3.37
Dystrophic calcification in degenerated tunica media
of muscular artery of uterine myometrium in Mönckeberg’s arterio-
sclerosis.

hyperplasia ( postfix word -trophy means nourishment; -plasia
means growth of new cells).
Changing the pathway of phenotypic differentiation of
cells i.e. metaplasia and dysplasia (prefix word meta- means
transformation; dys- means bad development).
In general, the adaptive responses are reversible on withdrawal
of stimulus. However, if the irritant stimulus persists for long
time, the cell may not be able to survive and may either die
or progress further e.g. cell death may occur in sustained
atrophy; dysplasia may progress into carcinoma in situ. Thus,
the concept of evolution ‘survival of the fittest’ holds true
for adaptation as ‘survival of the adaptable’.
Various mechanisms which may be involved in adaptive
cellular responses include the following:
Altered cell surface receptor binding.
Alterations in signal for protein synthesis.
Synthesis of new proteins by the target cell such as heat-
shock proteins (HSPs).
Common forms of cellular adaptive responses along with
examples of physiologic and pathologic adaptations are
briefly discussed below (Fig. 3.39).

CHAPTER 3
Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations
ATROPHY
Reduction of the number and size of parenchymal cells of an
organ or its parts which was once normal is called atrophy
(compared from hypoplasia which is the term used for
developmentally small size, and aplasia for extreme failure
of development so that only rudimentary tissue is present).
CAUSES. Atrophy may occur from physiologic or pathologic
causes:
A. Physiologic atrophy. Atrophy is a normal process of
aging in some tissues, which could be due to loss of endocrine
stimulation or arteriosclerosis. For example:
i)
Atrophy of lymphoid tissue in lymph nodes, appendix
and thymus.
ii) Atrophy of gonads after menopause.
iii) Atrophy of brain with aging.
B. Pathologic atrophy. The causes are as under:
1.
Starvation atrophy. In starvation, there is first depletion
of carbohydrate and fat stores followed by protein
catabolism. There is general weakness, emaciation and
anaemia referred to as cachexia seen in cancer and severely
ill patients.
2.
Ischaemic atrophy. Gradual diminution of blood supply
due to atherosclerosis may result in shrinkage of the affected
organ e.g.
i)
Small atrophic kidney in atherosclerosis of renal artery.
ii) Atrophy of brain in cerebral atherosclerosis.
3.
Disuse atrophy. Prolonged diminished functional activity
is associated with disuse atrophy of the organ e.g.
i)
Wasting of muscles of limb immobilised in cast.
ii) Atrophy of .the pancreas in obstruction of pancreatic duct.
4.
Neuropathic atrophy. Interruption in nerve supply leads
to wasting of muscles e.g.
i)
Poliomyelitis
ii) Motor neuron disease
iii) Nerve section.
5.
Endocrine atrophy. Loss of endocrine regulatory
mechanism results in reduced metabolic activity of tissues
and hence atrophy e.g.
i)
Hypopituitarism may lead to atrophy of thyroid, adrenal
and gonads.
ii) Hypothyroidism may cause atrophy of the skin and its
adnexal structures.
6.
Pressure atrophy. Prolonged pressure from benign
tumours or cyst or aneurysm may cause compression and
atrophy of the tissues e.g.
i)
Erosion of spine by tumour in nerve root.
ii) Erosion of skull by meningioma arising from pia-
arachnoid.
iii) Erosion of sternum by aneurysm of arch of aorta.
7.
Idiopathic atrophy. There are some examples of atrophy
where no obvious cause is present e.g.
i)
Myopathies.
ii) Testicular atrophy.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Irrespective of the
underlying cause for atrophy, the pathologic changes are
similar. The organ is small, often shrunken. The cells
become smaller in size but are not dead cells. Shrinkage
in cell size is due to reduction in cell organelles, chiefly
mitochondria, myofilaments and endoplasmic reticulum.
There is often increase in the number of autophagic
vacuoles containing cell debris (Fig. 3.40). These
autophagic vacuoles may persist to form ‘residual bodies’
in the cell cytoplasm e.g. lipofuscin pigment granules in
brown atrophy (page 43).
HYPERTROPHY
Hypertrophy is an increase in the size of parenchymal cells
resulting in enlargement of the organ or tissue, without any
change in the number of cells.
CAUSES. Hypertrophy may be physiologic or pathologic.
In both cases, it is caused either by increased functional
demand or by hormonal stimulation. Hypertrophy without
accompanying hyperplasia affects mainly muscles. In non-
dividing cells too, only hypertrophy occurs.
A. Physiologic hypertrophy. Enlarged size of the uterus in
pregnancy is an excellent example of physiologic
hypertrophy as well as hyperplasia.
B. Pathologic hypertrophy. Examples of certain diseases
associated with hypertrophy are as under:
1.
Hypertrophy of cardiac muscle may occur in a number of
cardiovascular diseases. A few conditions producing left
ventricular hypertrophy are as under:
i)
Systemic hypertension
ii) Aortic valve disease (stenosis and insufficiency)
iii) Mitral insufficiency
2.
Hypertrophy of smooth muscle e.g.
i)
Cardiac achalasia (in oesophagus)
ii) Pyloric stenosis (in stomach)

hyalinisation, peritubular fibrosis and diminished number and size of

interstitium.

56
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
iii) Intestinal strictures
iv) Muscular arteries in hypertension.
3.
Hypertrophy of skeletal muscle e.g. hypertrophied muscles
in athletes and manual labourers.
4.
Compensatory hypertrophy may occur in an organ when
the contralateral organ is removed e.g.
i)
Following nephrectomy on one side in a young patient,
there is compensatory hypertrophy as well as hyperplasia
of the nephrons of the other kidney.
ii) Adrenal hyperplasia following removal of one adrenal
gland.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The affected organ is
enlarged and heavy. For example, a hypertrophied heart
of a patient with systemic hypertension may weigh
700-800 g as compared to average normal adult weight of
350 g. There is enlargement of muscle fibres as well as of
nuclei (Fig. 3.41). At ultrastructural level, there is increased
synthesis of DNA and RNA, increased protein synthesis
and increased number of organelles like mitochondria,
endoplasmic reticulum and myofibrils.
HYPERPLASIA
Hyperplasia is an increase in the number of parenchymal
cells resulting in enlargement of the organ or tissue. Quite
often, both hyperplasia and hypertrophy occur together.
Hyperplasia occurs due to increased recruitment of cells from
G0 (resting) phase of the cell cycle to undergo mitosis, when
stimulated. All body cells do not possess hyperplastic growth
potential (Chapter 6). Labile cells (e.g. epithelial cells of the
skin and mucous membranes, cells of the bone marrow and
lymph nodes) and stable cells (e.g. parenchymal cells of the
liver, pancreas, kidney, adrenal, and thyroid) can undergo
hyperplasia, while permanent cells (e.g. neurons, cardiac and
skeletal muscle) have little or no capacity for regenerative
hyperplastic growth. Neoplasia differs from hyperplasia in
having hyperplastic growth with loss of growth-regulatory
mechanism due to change in genetic composition of the cell.
Hyperplasia, on the other hand, persists so long as stimulus
is present.
CAUSES. As with other non-neoplastic adaptive disorders
of growth, hyperplasia has also been divided into physiologic
and pathologic.
A. Physiologic hyperplasia. The two most common types
are as follows:
1.
Hormonal hyperplasia i.e. hyperplasia occurring under the
influence of hormonal stimulation e.g.
i)
Hyperplasia of female breast at puberty, during preg-
nancy and lactation.
ii) Hyperplasia of pregnant uterus.
iii) Proliferative activity of normal endometrium after a
normal menstrual cycle.
iv) Prostatic hyperplasia in old age.
2.
Compensatory hyperplasia i.e. hyperplasia occurring
following removal of part of an organ or a contralateral organ
in paired organ e.g.
i)
Regeneration of the liver following partial hepatectomy
ii) Regeneration of epidermis after skin abrasion
iii) Following nephrectomy on one side, there is hyperplasia
of nephrons of the other kidney.
B. Pathologic hyperplasia. Most examples of pathologic
hyperplasia are due to excessive stimulation of hormones or
growth factors e.g.
i)
Endometrial hyperplasia following oestrogen excess.
ii) In wound healing, there is formation of granulation tissue
due to proliferation of fibroblasts and endothelial cells.

with irregular outlines.

iii) Formation of skin warts from hyperplasia of epidermis
due to human papilloma virus.
iv) Pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia of the skin.
v) Intraductal epithelial hyperplasia in the breast in
fibrocystic breast disease.
PATHOLOGIC FEATURES. There is enlargement of the
affected organ or tissue and increase in the number of cells
(Fig. 3.42). This is due to increased rate of DNA synthesis
and hence increased mitoses of the cells.
METAPLASIA
Metaplasia is defined as a reversible change of one type of
epithelial or mesenchymal adult cells to another type of adult
epithelial or mesenchymal cells, usually in response to
abnormal stimuli, and often reverts back to normal on removal
of stimulus. However, if the stimulus persists for a long time,
epithelial metaplasia may transform into cancer (Fig. 3.43).
Metaplasia is broadly divided into 2 types: epithelial and
mesenchymal.
A. EPITHELIAL METAPLASIA. This is the more common
type. The metaplastic change may be patchy or diffuse and
usually results in replacement by stronger but less well-
specialised epithelium. However, the metaplastic epithelium
being less well-specialised such as squamous type, results
in deprivation of protective mucus secretion and hence more
prone to infection. Depending upon the type epithelium
transformed, two types of epithelial metaplasia are seen
squamous and columnar:
1.
Squamous metaplasia. This is more common. Various
types of specialised epithelium are capable of undergoing
squamous metaplastic change due to chronic irritation that
may be mechanical, chemical or infective in origin. Some
common examples of squamous metaplasia are seen at
following sites:
i)
In bronchus (normally lined by pseudostratified columnar
ciliated epithelium) in chronic smokers.
ii) In uterine endocervix (normally lined by simple columnar
epithelium) in prolapse of the uterus and in old age
(Fig. 3.44).
iii) In gallbladder (normally lined by simple columnar
epithelium) in chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis.
iv) In prostate (ducts normally lined by simple columnar
epithelium) in chronic prostatitis and oestrogen therapy.
v) In renal pelvis and urinary bladder (normally lined by
transitional epithelium) in chronic infection and stones.
vi) In vitamin A deficiency, apart from xerophthalmia, there
is squamous metaplasia in the nose, bronchi, urinary tract,
lacrimal and salivary glands.
2.
Columnar metaplasia. There are some conditions in
which there is transformation to columnar epithelium. For
example:
i)
Intestinal metaplasia in healed chronic gastric ulcer.
ii) Columnar metaplasia in Barrett’s oesophagus, in which
there is change of normal squamous epithelium to columnar
epithelium (Fig. 3.45).

epithelium in chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis to
columnar type.
iv) In cervical erosion (congenital and adult type), there is
variable area of endocervical glandular mucosa everted into
the vagina.
B. MESENCHYMAL METAPLASIA. Less often, there is
transformation of one adult type of mesenchymal tissue to
another. The examples are as under:
1.
Osseous metaplasia. Osseous metaplasia is formation of
bone in fibrous tissue, cartilage and myxoid tissue. Examples
of osseous metaplasia are as under:
i)
In arterial wall in old age (Mönckeberg’s medial calcific
sclerosis)
ii) In soft tissues in myositis ossificans
iii) In cartilage of larynx and bronchi in elderly people
iv) In scar of chronic inflammation of prolonged duration
v) In the fibrous stroma of tumour (Fig. 3.46).
2.
Cartilaginous metaplasia. In healing of fractures,
cartilaginous metaplasia may occur where there is undue
mobility.
DYSPLASIA
Dysplasia means ‘disordered cellular development’, often
accompanied with metaplasia and hyperplasia; it is therefore
also referred to as atypical hyperplasia. Dysplasia occurs most
often in epithelial cells. Epithelial dysplasia is characterised
by cellular proliferation and cytologic changes. These changes
include:
1.
Increased number of layers of epithelial cells
2.
Disorderly arrangement of cells from basal layer to the
surface layer
3.
Loss of basal polarity i.e. nuclei lying away from
basement membrane
4.
Cellular and nuclear pleomorphism
5.
Increased nucleocytoplasmic ratio
6.
Nuclear hyperchromatism
7.
Increased mitotic activity.
The two most common examples of dysplastic changes
are the uterine cervix (Fig. 3.47) and respiratory tract.
Dysplastic changes often occur due to chronic irritation
or prolonged inflammation. On removal of the inciting
stimulus, the changes may disappear. In a proportion of
cases, however, dysplasia progresses into carcinoma in situ
(cancer confined to layers superficial to basement membrane)
or invasive cancer. This concept is further discussed again
in details in Chapters 8, 17, and 24.
The differences between dysplasia and metaplasia are
contrasted in Table 3.7.

composed of the smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts show osseous
metaplasia in the centre.

CHAPTER 3
Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations
CELLULAR AGING
Old age is a concept of longevity in human beings. The
consequences of aging appear after reproductive age.
However, aging is distinct from mortality and disease
although aged individuals are more vulnerable to disease.
The average age of death of primitive man was barely
20-25 years compared to life-expectancy now which is
approaching 80 years, survival being longer in women than
men (3:2). About a century ago, the main causes of death
were accidents and infections. But now with greater safety
and sanitation, the mortality in the middle years has
sufficiently declined. However, the maximum human
lifespan has remained stable at about 110 years. Higher life
expectancy in women is not due to difference in the response
of somatic cells of the two sexes but higher mortality rate in
men is attributed to violent causes and greater susceptibility
to cardiovascular disease, cancer, cirrhosis and respiratory
diseases, for which cigarette smoking and alcohol
consumption are two most important contributory factors.
In general, the life expectancy of an individual depends
upon the following factors:
1.
Intrinsic genetic process i.e. the genes controlling response
to endogenous and exogenous factors initiating apoptosis in
senility.
2.
Environmental factors e.g. consumption and inhalation of
harmful substances, diet, role of antioxidants etc.
3.
Lifestyle of the individual such as diseases due to alcoholism
(e.g. cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma), smoking (e.g.
bronchogenic carcinoma and other respiratory diseases),
drug addiction.
4.
Age-related diseases e.g. atherosclerosis and ischaemic
heart disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoporosis,
Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease etc.
CELLULAR BASIS
With age, structural and functional changes occur in different
organs and systems of the human body. Although no
definitive biologic basis of aging is established, most
acceptable theory is the functional decline of non-dividing
cells such as neurons and myocytes. The following
hypotheses based on investigations explain the cellular basis
of aging:
1.
Experimental cellular senescence. By in vitro studies of
tissue culture, it has been observed that cultured human
fibroblasts replicate for up to 50 population doublings and
then the culture dies out. It means that in vitro there is reduced
functional capacity to proliferate with age. Studies have
shown that there is either loss of chromosome 1 or deletion
of its long arm (1q). Alternatively it has been observed that
with every cell division there is progressive shortening of
telomere present at the tips of chromosomes, which in normal
cell is repaired by the presence of RNA enzyme, telomerase.
However, due to aging, because of inadequate presence of
telomerase enzyme, lost telomere is not repaired resulting
in interference in viability of cell (Fig. 3.48).

General Pathology and Basic Techniques
2.
Genetic control in invertebrates. Clock (clk) genes
responsible for controlling the rate and time of aging have
been identified in lower invertebrates e.g. clk-1 gene mutation
in the metazoa, Caenorhabditis elegans, results in prolonging
the lifespan of the worm and slowing of some metabolic
functions.
3.
Diseases of accelerated aging. Aging under genetic
control in human beings is supported by the observation of
high concordance in lifespan of identical twins. A heritable
condition associated with signs of accelerated aging process
is termed progeria and is characterised by baldness, cataracts,
and coronary artery disease. Another example is Werner’s
syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disease, characterised
by similar features of premature aging, atherosclerosis and
risk for development of various cancers.
4.
Oxidative stress hypothesis (free radical-mediated
injury).Currently, it is believed that aging is partly caused
by progressive and reversible molecular oxidative damage
due to persistent oxidative stress on the human cells. In
normal cells, very small amount (3%) of total oxygen
consumption by the cell is converted into reactive oxygen
species. The rate of generation of reactive oxygen species is
directly correlated with metabolic rate of the organisms. With
aging, there is low metabolic rate with generation of toxic
oxygen radicals, which fail to get eliminated causing their
accumulation and hence cell damage. The underlying
mechanism appears to be oxidative damage to mitochondria.
The role of antioxidant in retarding the oxidant damage has
been reported in some studies.
ORGAN CHANGES IN AGING
Although all organs start showing deterioration with aging,
following organs show evident morphologic and functional
changes:
1. Cardiovascular system: Atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis with
calcification, Mönckeberg’s medial calcification, brown
atrophy of heart, loss of elastic tissue from aorta and major
arterial trunks causing their dilatation.
2. Nervous system: Atrophy of gyri and sulci, Alzheimer’s
disease, Parkinson’s disease.
3. Musculoskeletal system: Degenerative bone diseases,
frequent fractures due to loss of bone density, age related
muscular degeneration.
4. Eyes: Deterioration of vision due to cataract and vascular
changes in retina.
5. Hearing: Disability in hearing due to senility is related to
otosclerosis.
6. Immune system: Reduced IgG response to antigens, frequent
and severe infections.
7. Skin: Laxity of skin due to loss of elastic tissue.
8. Cancers: As discussed later in Chapter 8, 80% of cancers
occur in the age range of 50 and 80 years.

INTRODUCTION
Immunity and immunopathology are proverbial two edges
of ‘double-edged sword’.
Before discussing immunopathology which is the study
of derangements in the immune system, it is important to
know the normal structure and function of the immune
system (immunophysiology) and to get familiarised with a
few terms and definitions commonly used in any description
of immunology.
An antigen (Ag) is defined as a substance, usually protein
in nature, which when introduced into the tissues stimulates
antibody production.
Hapten is a non-protein substance which has no antigenic
properties, but on combining with a protein can form a new
antigen capable of forming antibodies.
An antibody (Ab) is a protein substance produced as a
result of antigenic stimulation. Circulating antibodies are
immunoglobulins (Igs) of which there are 5 classes: IgG, IgA,
IgM, IgE and IgD.
An antigen may induce specifically sensitised cells
having the capacity to recognise, react and neutralise the
injurious agent or organisms.
The antigen may combine with antibody to form antigen-
antibody complex. The reaction of Ag with Ab in vitro may
be primary or secondary phenomena; the secondary reaction
induces a number of processes. In vivo, the Ag-Ab reaction
may cause tissue damage (Fig. 4.1).
TYPES OF IMMUNITY. Broadly speaking, immunity or
body defense mechanism is divided into 2 types, each with
humoral and cellular components:
Natural or innate immunity is non-specific and is
considered as the first line of defense without antigenic
specificity. It has 2 major components:
a) Humoral: comprised by complement.
b) Cellular: consists of neutrophils, macrophages, and
natural killer (NK) cells.
Specific or adaptive immunity is specific and is
characterised by antigenic specificity. It too has 2 main
components:
a) Humoral: consisting of antibodies formed by B cells.
b) Cellular: mediated by T cells.
The various components of both types of immunity are
interdependent and interlinked for their functions.
STRUCTURE OF IMMUNE SYSTEM
ORGANS OF IMMUNE SYSTEM
Although functioning as a system, the organs of immune
system are distributed at different places in the body.  These
are as under:
a) Primary lymphoid organs:
i)
Thymus
ii) Bone marrow
b) Secondary lymphoid organs:
i)
Lymph nodes
ii) Spleen
iii) MALT (Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue located in
the respiratory tract and GIT).
These organs have been described in the respective
chapters in the book.
CELLS OF IMMUNE SYSTEM
The cells comprising immune system are as follows:
i)
Lymphocytes
ii) Monocytes and macrophages
iii) Mast cells and basophils
iv) Neutrophils
v) Eosinophils
While morphologic aspects of these cells are covered
elsewhere in the book, their immune functions are briefly
considered below and summarised in Table 4.1.
Lymphocytes
Lymphocyte is the master of human immune system.
Morphologically, lymphocytes appear as a homogeneous
group but functionally two major lymphocyte populations,
T and B  lymphocytes are identified; while a third type, NK
(natural killer) cells, comprises a small percentage of
circulating lymphocytes having the distinct appearance of
large granular lymphocytes.
Figure 4.1
Antigen-antibody reactions. Primary and secondary
reactions occur in vitro while tissue damage results from in vivo Ag-Ab
reaction.

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
Just as other haematopoietic cells, all three subtypes of
lymphocytes are formed from lymphoid precursor cells in
the bone marrow. However, unlike other haematopoietic
cells, lymphocytes undergo maturation and differentiation
in the bone marrow (B cells) and thymus (T cells) and acquire
certain genetic and immune surface characters which
determine their type and function; this is based on cluster of
differentiation (CD) molecule on their surface. CD surface
protein molecules belong to immunoglobulin superfamily
of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). About 250 different
surface CD molecules have been identified so far, which can
be identified by ‘CD markers’ by specific monoclonal
antibody stain employing immunohistochemistry or by flow
cytometry.  B and T lymphocytes proliferate into ‘memory
cells’ imparting long lasting immunity against specific
antigens.
While B cells differentiate into plasma cells which form
specific antibodies, T cells get functionally activated on
coming in contact with appropriate antigen. Upon coming
in contact with antigen, it is the macrophage, i.e. specialised

antigen-presenting cell such as dendritic cell, and the major
histocompatibilty complex (MHC) in the macrophage, which
determines whether the invading antigen is to be presented
to B cells or T cells. Some strong antigens that cannot be dealt
by antibody response from B cells such as certain
microorganisms (e.g. viruses, mycobacteria M. tuberculosis
and M. leprae), cancer cells, tissue transplantation antigen etc,
are presented to T cells.
Features and functions of subtypes of lymphocytes are
summed up below and illustrated diagrammatically in
Fig. 4.2:
B CELLS.  These cells are involved in humoral immunity by
inciting antibody response. B cells in circulation comprise
about 10-15% of lymphocytes. On coming in contact with
antigen (e.g. invading microorganims), B cells are activated
to proliferate and transform into plasmacytoid lymphocytes
and then into plasma cells. Depending upon the maturation
stage of B cells, specific CD molecules appear on the cell
surface which can be identified by CD markers; common B
cell markers include: CD 19, 20, 21, 23. These cells also possess
B cell receptors (BCR) for surface immunoglobulins (IgM and
IgG) and Fc receptor for attaching to antibody molecule.
T cell help is provided to B cells by a subset of T helper cells,
TH 2, by elaborated interleukins (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13).
T CELLS.  These cells are implicated in inciting cell-mediated
immunity and delayed type of hypersensitivity. T cells in
circulation comprise 75-80% of lymphocytes. Pan T cell
markers are CD3, CD7and CD2. Besides, T cells also carry
receptor (TCR) for recognition of MHC molecules. Depending
upon functional activity, T cells have two major subtypes: T
helper cells and T suppressor cells.
T helper cells. Abbreviated as TH cells, these cells promote
and enhance the immune reaction and are also termed as
T-regulatory cells. They carry CD4 molecule on their surface
and hence are also called CD4+ cells. CD4+ cells in circulation
are about twice the number of CD8+ cells (CD4+/CD8 ratio
2:1). These cells act by elaboration of variety of cytokines.
Depending upon the type of cytokines elaborated, these
TH cells are further of two subclasses: TH 1 and TH 2.
TH 1 cells elaborate IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-γ.
TH 2 cells elaborate IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10.
CD4+ cells are predominantly involved in cell-mediated
reactions to viral infections (e.g. in HIV), tissue transplant
reactions and tumour lysis.
T suppressor cells. Abbreviated as TS cells, they suppress
immune reactions but are cytotoxic and actually destroy the
invading antigen; hence are also termed as cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CTL).  These cells carry CD8 molecule on their
surface and hence are also called CD8+ cells. CD8+ cells in
circulation are about half the number of CD4+ cells.
Compared to CD4+ cells which act by elaboration of
cytokines, CD8+ cells are directly cytotoxic to the antigen.
CD8+ cells are particularly involved in destroying cells
infected with viruses, foreign cells and tumour cells.
Contrasting features of B and T cells are given in
Table 4.2.

64
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
NATURAL KILLER (NK) CELLS. NK cells comprise about
10-15% of circulating lymphocytes. These lymphocytes do
not have B or T cell markers, nor are these cells dependent
upon thymus for development unlike CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells. NK cells carry surface molecules of CD2, CD16 and
CD56, but negative for T cell marker CD3. NK cells are
morphologically distinct from B and T cells in being large
granular lymphocytes.
NK cells are part of the natural or innate immunity. These
cells recognise antibody-coated target cells and bring about
killing of the target directly; this process is termed as antibody-
dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). This mechanism
is particularly operative against viruses and tumour cells.
Monocytes and Macrophages
The role of macrophages in inflammation consisting of
circulating monocytes, organ-specific macrophages and
histiocytes has been described in Chapter 6. Circulating
monocytes are immature macrophages and constitute about
5% of peripheral leucocytes. They remain in circulation for
about 3 days before they enter tissues to become macrophages.
The macrophage subpopulations like the dendritic cells found
in the lymphoid tissue and Langerhans’ cells seen in the
epidermis, are characterised by the presence of dendritic
cytoplasmic processes and are active in the immune system.
Salient features and important immune functions of
macrophages are as follows:
1. Antigen recognition. They possess cell surface receptors
to several extracellular molecules— receptor for cytokines,
component of complement (C3b), selectins, integrins and Fc
(constant fragment) of antibody. These receptors recognise
the organisms and initiate intracellular mechanism in
macrophages. Antigen to become recognisable can also get
coated by antibodies or complement, the process being
termed as opsonisation.  Macrophages have capacity to
distinguish self from non-self by presence of human leucocyte
antigens (HLA) or major histocompatibilty complex (MHC)
discussed below.
2.  Phagocytosis. Antigen that has been recognised by the
macrophages due to availability of above-mentioned surface
receptors, or the opsonised antigen, is ready to be engulfed
by the process of cell-eating by macrophages explained on
page 134.
3. Secretory function. Macrophages secrete important
substances as follows:
i) Cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, 8, IL-10, IL-12, tumour necrosis
factor-α) and prostaglandins (PGE, thromboxane-A,
leukotrienes) which are chemical mediators of  inflammation
and activate other leucocytes.
ii) Secretion of proteins involved in wound healing e.g.
collagenase, elastase, fibroblast growth factor, angiogenesis
factor.
iii) Acute phase reactants e.g. fibronectin, microglobulin,
complement components.
4. Antigen presentation.  When macrophages are unable to
lyse an antigen or an organism, the next best course adopted
by them is to act as antigen-presenting cells for presenting
to immunocompetent T cells (subtype CD4+ or CD8+ cells),
or to B cells. Accordingly, the lymphoid cell would then deal
with such antigen.
Basophils and Mast Cells
Basophils are a type of circulating granulocytes (0-1%) while
mast cells are their counterparts seen in tissues, especially
in connective tissue around blood vessels and in submucosal
location. Basophils and mast cells have IgE surface receptor;
thus on coming in contact with antigen binding to IgE (e.g.
allergic reaction to parasites), these cells get activated and
release granules i.e. degranulate. These granules contain
substances such as: histamine, platelet activating factor,
heparin and certain chemical mediators (e.g. prostaglandins,
leukotrienes).
Mast cells and basophils are thus involved in mediating
inflammation in allergic reactions and have a role in wound
healing.
Neutrophils
Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are normally the
most numerous of the circulating leucocytes (40-75%). The
cytoplasm of PMNs contains lysosomal granules of three
types: primary (azurophilic), secondary, and tertiary.
PMNs have similar function to those of macrophages and
are therefore appropriately referred to as ‘microphages’ owing
to their role as first line of defense against an invading foreign
organism in the body. However, these cells have limitation
of size and type of organisms to be engulfed e.g. while they
are capable of acting against bacteria and small foreign
particulate material but not against viruses and large
particles.
Eosinophils
Eosinophils are also circulating granulocytes (1-6%). These
cells play a role in allergic reactions and in intestinal
helminthiasis. The granules of eosinophils contain lysosomal
enzymes, peroxidases, and chemical mediators of
inflammation (e.g. prostaglandins, leukotrienes). On coming
in contact with IgE opsonised antigen (e.g. helminths),
eosinophils degranulate and release the chemicals stored in
granules and incite inflammation.
HLA SYSTEM AND MAJOR
HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX
Though not a component of immune system, HLA system is
described here as it is considered important in the regulation
of the immune system. HLA stands for Human Leucocyte
Antigens because these antigens or genetic proteins in the
body which determine one’s own tissue from non-self
(histocompatibility) were first discovered on the surface of
leucocytes. Subsequently, it was found that HLA are actually
gene complexes of proteins on the surface of all nucleated
cells of the body and platelets. Since these complexes are of
immense importance in matching donor and recipient for
organ transplant, they are called major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) or HLA complex.

65
CHAPTER 4
Immunopathology Including Amyloidosis
Out of various genes for histocompatibility, most of the
transplantation antigens or MHC are located on a portion of
chromosome 6 of all nucleated cells of the body and platelets.
These genes occupy four regions or loci—A, B, C and D, on
the short (p) arm of chromosome 6 and exhibit marked
variation in allelic genes at each locus. Therefore, the product
of HLA antigens is highly polymorphic. The letter w in some
of the genes (e.g. Dw3, Cw4, Bw15 etc) refers to the numbers
allocated to them at international workshops. HLA system
is part of immunoglobulin superfamily of CAMs.
Depending upon the characteristics of MHC, they have
been divided into 3 classes (Fig. 4.2):
Class I MHC antigens have loci as HLA-A, HLA-B and
HLA-C. CD8+ (i.e. T suppressor) lymphocytes carry
receptors for class I MHC and these cells are used to identify
class I antigen on them.
Class II MHC antigens have single locus as HLA-D.
These antigens have further 3 loci: DR, DQ and DP. Class II
MHC is identified by B cells and CD4+ (i.e. T helper) cells.
Class III MHC antigens are some components of the
complement system (C2 and C4) coded on HLA complex but
are not associated with HLA expression and are not used in
antigen identification.
In view of high polymorphism of class I and class II genes,
they have a number of alleles on loci numbered serially like
HLA-A 1, HLA-A 2, HLA-A 3 etc.
MHC antigens present on the cell surface help the
macrophage in its function of bacterial antigen recognition
i.e. they help to identify self from foreign, and accordingly
present the foreign antigen to T cells (CD4+ or CD8+) or to B
cells.
ROLE OF HLA COMPLEX. The HLA complex is significant
in a number of ways:
1.
Organ transplantation. Historically, the major
importance of HLA system is in matching donor and recipient
for tissue transplantation. The recipient’s immune system
can recognise the histocompatibility antigens on the donor
organ and accordingly accept it or reject it. Both humoral as
well as cell-mediated immune responses are involved in case
of genetically non-identical transplants.
2.
Regulation of the immune system. Class I and II
histocompatibility antigens play a role in regulating both
cellular and humoral immunity:
Class I MHC antigens regulate the function of cytotoxic
T cells (CD8+ subpopulation) e.g. in virus infections.
Class II MHC antigens  regulate the function of helper
T cells (CD4+ subpopulation).
3.
Association of diseases with HLA. An increasing
number of diseases have been found to have association with
some specific histocompatibility antigens. These disorders
include the following:
i)
Inflammatory disorders e.g. ankylosing spondylitis.
ii) Autoimmune disorders e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, insulin-
dependent diabetes mellitus.
iii) Inherited disorders of metabolism e.g. idiopathic
haemochromatosis.
The exact mechanism of such associations between the
disease and HLA type is not clearly understood.
TRANSPLANT REJECTION
According to the genetic relationship between donor and
recipient, transplantation of tissues is classified into 4 groups:
1.
Autografts are grafts in which the donor and recipient is
the same individual.
2.
Isografts are grafts between the donor and recipient of
the same genotype.
3.
Allografts are those in which the donor is of the same
species but of a different genotype.
4.
Xenografts are those in which the donor is of a different
species from that of the recipient.
All types of grafts have been performed in human beings
but xenografts have been found to be rejected invariably due
to genetic disparity. Presently, surgical skills exist for skin
grafts and for organ transplants such as kidney, heart, lungs,
liver, pancreas, cornea and bone marrow. But most
commonly practised are skin grafting, and kidney and bone
marrow transplantation. For any successful tissue transplant
without immunological rejection, matched major histocom-
patibility locus antigens (HLA) between the donor and
recipient are of paramount importance as discussed already.
The greater the genetic disparity between donor and recipient
in HLA system, the stronger and more rapid will be the
rejection reaction.
Besides the rejection reaction, a peculiar problem
occurring especially in bone marrow transplantation is graft-
versus-host (GVH) reaction. In humans, GVH reaction results
when immunocompetent cells are transplanted to an
immunodeficient recipient e.g. when severe combined immu-
nodeficiency is treated by bone marrow transplantation. The
Figure 4.3

66
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
clinical features of GVH reaction include: fever, weight loss,
anaemia, dermatitis, diarrhoea, intestinal malabsorption,
pneumonia and hepatosplenomegaly. The intensity of GVH
reaction depends upon the extent of genetic disparity
between the donor and recipient.
Mechanisms of Graft Rejection
Except for autografts and isografts, an immune response
against allografts is inevitable. The development of
immunosuppressive drugs has made the survival of
allografts in recipients possible. Rejection of allografts
involves both cell-mediated and humoral immunity.
1.
CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNE REACTIONS. These are
mainly responsible for graft rejection and are mediated by
T cells. The lymphocytes of the recipient on coming in
contact with HLA antigens of the donor are sensitised in
case of incompatibility. Sensitised T cells in the form of
cytotoxic T cells (CD8+) as well as by hypersensitivity
reactions initiated by T helper cells (CD4+) attack the graft
and destroy it.
2.
HUMORAL IMMUNE REACTIONS. Currently, in
addition to the cell-mediated immune reactions, a role for
humoral antibodies in certain rejection reactions has been
suggested. These include: preformed circulating antibodies due
to pre-sensitisation of the recipient before transplantation e.g.
by blood transfusions and previous pregnancies, or in non-
sensitised individuals by complement dependent cytotoxicity,
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and
antigen-antibody complexes.
Types of Rejection Reactions
Based on the underlying mechanism and time period,
rejection reactions are classified into 3 types: hyperacute,
acute and chronic.
1.
HYPERACUTE REJECTION. Hyperacute rejection
appears within minutes to hours of placing the transplant
and destroys it. It is mediated by preformed humoral
antibody against donor-antigen. Cross-matching of the
donor’s lymphocytes with those of the recipient before
transplantation has diminished the frequency of hyperacute
rejection.
Grossly, hyperacute rejection is recognised by the surgeon
soon after the vascular anastomosis of the graft is
performed to the recipient’s vessels. The organ becomes
swollen, oedematous, haemorrhagic, purple and cyanotic
rather than gaining pink colour.
Histologically, the characteristics of Arthus reaction are
present. There are numerous neutrophils around dilated
and obstructed capillaries which are blocked by fibrin and
platelet thrombi. Small segments of blood vessel wall may
become necrotic and there is necrosis of much of the
transplanted organ. Small haemorrhages are common.
2.
ACUTE REJECTION. This usually becomes evident
within a few days to a few months of transplantation. Acute
graft rejection may be mediated by cellular or humoral
mechanisms. Acute cellular rejection is more common than
acute humoral rejection.
Microscopically, the features of the two forms are   as
under:
Acute cellular rejection is characterised by extensive
infiltration in the interstitium of the transplant by lympho-
cytes (mainly T cells), a few plasma cells, monocytes and
a few polymorphs. There is damage to the blood vessels
and there are foci of necrosis in the transplanted tissue.
Acute humoral rejection appears due to poor response to
immunosuppressive therapy. It is characterised by acute
rejection vasculitis and foci of necrosis in small vessels.
The mononuclear cell infiltrate is less marked as compared
to acute cellular rejection and consists mostly of
B lymphocytes.
3.
CHRONIC REJECTION. Chronic rejection may follow
repeated attacks of acute rejection or may develop slowly
over a period of months to a year or so. The underlying
mechanisms of chronic rejection may be immunologic or
ischaemic. Patients with chronic rejection of renal transplant
show progressive deterioration in renal function as seen by
rising serum creatinine levels.
Microscopically, in chronic rejection of transplanted
kidney, the changes are intimal fibrosis, interstitial fibrosis
and tubular atrophy. Renal allografts may develop
glomerulonephritis by transmission from the host, or
rarely may be de novo glomerulonephritis.
DISEASES OF IMMUNITY
The word immunity is synonymous with resistance meaning
protection from particular diseases or injuries, whereas the
term hypersensitivity is interchangeable with allergy meaning
a state of exaggerated or altered immune response to a given
agent. The diseases of the immune system are broadly
classified into the following 4 groups:
I.
Immunodeficiency disorders characterised by deficient
cellular and/or humoral immune functions. This group is
comprised by a list of primary and secondary immunodeficiency
diseases including the dreaded acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS).
II. Hypersensitivity reactions characterised by hyper-
function of the immune system and cover the various mecha-
nisms of immunologic tissue injury.
III.  Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system
fails to recognise ‘self’ from ‘non-self’. A growing number of
autoimmune and collagen diseases are included in this group.
IV.  Possible immune disorders in which the immunologic
mechanisms are suspected in their etiopathogenesis. Classical
example of this group is amyloidosis discussed later in this
chapter.

67
CHAPTER 4
Immunopathology Including Amyloidosis
IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES
Failure or deficiency of immune system, which normally
plays a protective role against infections, manifests by
occurrence of repeated infections in an individual having
immunodeficiency diseases.
Traditionally, immunodeficiency diseases are classified
into 2 types:
A. Primary immunodeficiencies are usually the result of genetic
or developmental abnormality of the immune system.
B. Secondary immunodeficiencies arise from acquired
suppression of the immune system.
Since the first description of primary immunodeficiency
by Bruton in 1952, an increasing number of primary and
secondary immunodeficiency syndromes are being added
to the list, the latest addition being the acquired immuno-
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1981.
A list of most immunodeficiency diseases with the
possible defect in the immune system is given in Table 4.3,
while an account of AIDS is given below.
ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS)
Since the initial recognition of AIDS in the United States in
1981, tremendous advances have taken place in the
understanding of this dreaded disease as regards its
epidemiology, etiology, immunology, pathogenesis, clinical
features and morphologic changes in various tissues and
organs of the body. But efforts at finding its definite treatment
and a vaccine have not yielded success so far, and thus the
prognosis remains grim. Hence the global attention is
presently focussed on preventive measures.
EPIDEMIOLOGY. Although AIDS was first described in the
US, the disease has now attained pandemic proportions
involving all continents.  Presently, developing countries
comprise majority of cases and Africa alone constitutes 50%
of all positive cases globally.  According to a rough estimate,
1 in every 100 sexually active adults worldwide is infected
with HIV. Half of all serologically positive cases are in women
while children comprise 5% of all cases. According to the
WHO data, the last decade has shown an alarming rise in
incidence of AIDS cases in South-East Asia including
Thailand, Indonesia and Indian sub-continent.  However,
giving exact figures of cases is pointless since the numbers
are increasing by millions and all such data become outdated
with every passing year. About 2.5 million new cases are
getting added every year. In India, epicentre of the epidemic
lies in the states of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu which

together comprise about 50% of all HIV positive cases (mostly
contracted sexually), while North-East state of Manipur
accounts for 8% of all cases (mostly among intravenous drug
abusers).
ETIOLOGIC AGENT. AIDS is caused by an RNA retrovirus
called human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which is a type
of human T cell leukaemia-lymphoma virus (HTLV).
HIV resembles other HTLVs in shape and size and both
have tropism for CD4 molecules present on subpopulation of
T cells which are the particular targets of attack by HIV.
However, HIV differs from HTLV in being cytolytic for T cells
causing immunodeficiency (cytopathic virus) while HTLV may
transform the target cells into T cell leukaemia (transforming virus)
(Chapter 8). Two forms of HIV have been described, HIV1
being the etiologic agent for AIDS in the US and Central
Africa, while HIV2 causes a similar disease in West Africa
and parts of India. Both HIV1 and HIV2 are zoonotic
infections and their origin can be traced to a species of
chimpanzees who are natural reservoir of HIV and most
likely source of original infection.
HIV-I virion or virus particle is spherical in shape and 100-
140 nm in size (Fig. 4.4):
It contains a core having core proteins, chiefly p24 and p18,
two strands of genomic RNA and the enzyme, reverse
transcriptase.
The core is covered by a double layer of lipid membrane
derived from the outer membrane of the infected host cell
during budding process of virus. The membrane is studded
with 2 envelope glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41, in the positions
shown.
Besides various other genes, three important genes code
for the respective components of virion:
i) gag (group antigen) for core proteins,
ii) pol (polymerase) for reverse transcriptase, and
iii) env (envelope) for the envelope proteins.
These genes and viral components act as markers for the
laboratory diagnosis of HIV infection. Besides, there is tat
(transcription activator) gene for viral functions such as
amplification of viral genes, viral budding and replication.
ROUTES OF TRANSMISSION. Transmission of HIV
infection occurs by one of following three routes:
1.
Sexual transmission. Sexual contact in the main mode
of spread and constitutes 75% of all cases of HIV
transmission. Most cases of AIDS in the industrialised world
like in the US occur in homosexual or bisexual males while
heterosexual promiscuity seems to be the dominant mode of
HIV infection in Africa and Asia. Other sexually transmitted
diseases (STDs) may act as cofactors for spread of HIV, in
particular gonorrhoeal and chlamydial infection.
Transmission from male-to-male and male-to-female is more
potent route than that from female-to-male.
2.
Transmission via blood and blood products. This mode
of transmission is the next largest group (25%) and occurs in
3 groups of high-risk populations:
i)
Intravenous drug abusers by sharing needles, syringes etc
comprise a large group in the US.
ii) Haemophiliacs who have received large amounts of
clotting factor concentrates from pooled blood components
from multiple donors.
iii) Recipients of HIV-infected blood and blood products who have
received multiple transfusions of whole blood or components
like platelets and plasma.
3. Perinatal transmission. HIV infection occurs from infected
mother to the newborn during pregnancy transplacentally, or
in immediate post-partum period through contamination with
maternal blood, infected amniotic fluid or breast milk.
4.
Occupational transmission. There have been a small
number of health care workers (HCW), laboratory workers
and those engaged in disposal of waste of sharps who have
developed HIV infection by occupational exposure to HIV-
infected material. It is imperative that these workers follow
CDC guidelines for universal precautions which include
disinfecting and sterilizing all reusable devices and use of
bleaching solution for disinfecting all blood spillage.
5. Transmission by other body fluids. Although besides
blood, HIV has been isolated and identified from a number
of body fluids such as saliva, tears, sweat and urine, semen,
vaginal secretions, cervical secretions, breast milk, CSF,
synovial, pleural, peritoneal and pericardial fluid, there is
no definite evidence that HIV transmission can occur by any
of these fluids; isolated cases of such infection reported are
in likelihood due to concomitant contamination with HIV-
infected blood.
It may, however, be understood regarding spread of HIV
infection that AIDS cannot be transmitted by casual non-sexual
contact like shaking hands, hugging, sharing household
facilities like beds, toilets, utensils etc.
It should also be appreciated that HIV contaminated
waste products can be sterilised and disinfected by most of the
chemical germicides used in laboratories at a much lower
concentration. These are: sodium hypochlorite (liquid

chlorine bleach), formaldehyde (5%), ethanol (70%),
glutaraldehyde (2%), β-propionolactone. HIV is also heat-
sensitive and can be inactivated at 56°C for 30 min.
PATHOGENESIS. The pathogenesis of HIV infection is
largely related to the depletion of CD4+ T cells (helper T cells)
resulting in profound immunosuppression.
The sequence of events shown schematically in Fig. 4.5
is outlined below:
1. Selective tropism for CD4 molecule receptor. gp120
envelope glycoprotein of HIV has selective tropism for cells
containing CD4 molecule receptor on their surface; these
cells most importantly are CD4+ T cells (T helper cells);
other such cells include monocyte-macrophages, microglial
cells, epithelial cells of the cervix, Langerhans cells of the
skin and follicular dendritic cells. Initially, HIV on entering
the body via any route described above has tropism for
macrophages (M-tropic) while later it becomes either dual
tropic or T-tropic only and thus affects mainly CD4+ T cells
which are the main target of attack by HIV.
2.
Internalisation. gp120 of the virion combines with CD4
receptor, but for fusion of virion with the host cell membrane,
a chemokine coreceptor (CCR) is necessary. Once HIV has
combined with CD4 receptor and CCR, gp41 glycoprotein
of envelope is internalised in the CD4+ T cell membrane.
3. Uncoating and viral DNA formation. Once the virion has
entered the T cell cytoplasm, reverse transcriptase of the viral
RNA forms a single-stranded DNA. Using the single-
stranded DNA as a template, DNA polymerase copies it to
make it double-stranded DNA, while destroying the original
RNA strands. Viral DNA so formed has frequent mutations
making the HIV quite resistant to anti-viral therapy.
4. Viral integration. The viral DNA so formed may initially
remain unintegrated in the affected cell but later viral integrase
protein inserts the viral DNA into nucleus of the host T cell
and integrates in the host cell DNA. At this stage, viral particle
is termed as HIV provirus.
5. Viral replication. HIV provirus having become part of host
cell DNA, host cell DNA transcripts for viral RNA with
presence of tat gene. Multiplication of viral particles is further
facilitated by release of cytokines from T helper cells (CD4+
T cells): TH 1 cells  elaborating IL-2 and IFN-γ., and TH 2 cells
elaborating IL-4, IL-5, IL6, IL-10. RNA viral particles thus
fill the cytoplasm of host T cell from where they acquire
protein coating. Released cytokines are also responsible for
spread of infection to other body sites, in particular to CNS
by TNF-α.
6. Latent period and immune attack. In an inactive infected
T cell, the infection may remain in latent phase for a long
time, accounting for the long incubation period. Immune
system does act against the virus by participation of CD4+
and CD8+ T cells, macrophages and by formation of
antibodies to mount attack against the virus. However, this
period is short and the virus soon overpowers the host
immune system.
7. CD4+ T cell destruction. Viral particles replicated in the
CD4+ T cells start forming buds from the cell wall of the host
cell. As these particles detach from the infected host cell, they
damage part of the cell membrane of the host cell and cause
death of host CD4+ T cells by apoptosis. Other proposed
mechanisms of CD4+ T cell destruction are necrosis of
Figure 4.5
Sequence of events in the pathogenesis of HIV infection.

70
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
precursors of CD4+ cells by the virus and by formation of
syncytial giant cells due to attachment of more and more of
gp120 molecules to the surface of CD4+ T cells.
8. Viral dissemination.  Release of viral particles from
infected host cell spreads the infection to more CD4+ host
cells and produces viraemia. Through circulation, virus gains
entry to the lymphoid tissues (lymph nodes, spleen) where
it multiplies further, and are the dominant site of virus
reservoir rather than circulation.
9.
Impact of HIV infection on other immune cells.  HIV
infects other cells of the host immune system and also affects
non-infected lymphoid cells.
Other cells of the immune system which get infected are
circulating moncytes, macrophage in tissues and dendritic
follicular cells of lymph nodes. HIV-infected monocytes-
macrophages do not get destroyed but instead become a
reservoir of HIV infection. Infected dendritic follicular cells
of the lymph nodes causes massive enlargement of follicle
centres and account for persistent generalised lymph-
adenopathy in AIDS.
Non-infected lymphoid cells include B cells, NK cells and
CD8+ T cells. B cells do not have receptors for HIV but the
number of B cells slowly declines, their function of
immunoglobulin synthesis is impaired due to lack of
activation by depleting CD4+ T cells, but instead there may
be non-specific hypergammaglobulinaemia. NK cells are also
reduced due to lack of cytokines from CD4+ T cells. CD8+
cells show lymphocytosis but the cells having intact function
of ADCC are reduced, possibly due to CD4+ T cell
quantitative loss and qualitative dysfunction (reversal of
CD4+ T cells: CD8+ T cell ratio).
The net result of immunological changes in the host due
to HIV infection lead to profound immunosuppression
rendering the host susceptible to opportunistic infections and
tumours, to which he ultimately  succumbs.
10. HIV infection of nervous system. Out of non-lymphoid
organ involvement, HIV infection of nervous system is the
most serious and 75-90% of AIDS patients may demonstrate
some form of neurological involvement at autopsy. It infects
microglial cells, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes as under:
i)
Infection carried to the microglia of the nervous system
by HIV infected CD4+ monocyte-macrophage subpopulation or
endothelial cells.
ii) Direct infection of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.
iii) Neurons are not invaded by HIV but are affected due to
attachment of gp120 and by release of cytokines by HIV-
infected macrophages.
A summary of major abnormalities in the immune system
in AIDS is given in Table 4.4.
NATURAL HISTORY.  HIV infection progresses from an
early acute syndrome to a prolonged asymptomatic state to
advanced disease. Thus there are different clinical mani-
festations at different stages. Generally, in an immuno-
competent host, the biologic course passes through following
3 phases (Table 4.5):
1.
Acute HIV syndrome (3-12 weeks). Entry of HIV into
the body is heralded by the following sequence of events:
i)
High levels of plasma viraemia due to replication of the
virus.
ii) Virus-specific immune response by formation of anti-HIV
antibodies (seroconversion) after 3-6 weeks of initial exposure
to HIV.
iii) Initially, sudden marked reduction in CD4+ T cells (helper
T cells) followed by return to normal levels.
iv) Rise in CD8+ T cells (Cytotoxic T cells).

Immunopathology Including Amyloidosis
v) Appearance of self-limited non-specific acute viral illness
(flu-like or infectious mononucleosis-like) in 50-70% of adults
within 3-6 weeks of initial infection. Manifestations include:
sore throat, fever, myalgia, skin rash, and sometimes, aseptic
meningitis. These symptoms resolve spontaneously in 2-3
weeks.
2.
Middle chronic phase (10-12 years). The initial acute sero-
conversion illness is followed by a phase of competition
between HIV and the host immune response as under:
i)
Viraemia due to viral replication in the lymphoid tissue
continues which is initially not as high but with passage of
time viral load increases due to crumbling host defenses.
ii) Chronic stage, depending upon host immune system,
may continue as long as 10 years.
iii) CD 4+ T cells continue to proliferate but net result is
moderate fall in CD4+ T cell counts.
iv) Cytotoxic CD8+ T cell count remains high.
v) Clinically, it may be a stage of latency and the patient
may be asymptomatic, or may develop mild constitutional
symptoms and persistent generalised lymphadenopathy.
3.
Final crisis phase. This phase is characterised by
profound immunosuppression and onset of full-blown AIDS
and has the following features:
i)
Marked increase in viraemia.
ii) The time period from HIV infection through chronic
phase into full-blown AIDS may last 7-10 years and culminate
in death.
iv) CD 4+ T cells are markedly reduced (below 200 per μl).
The average survival after the onset of full-blown AIDS
is about 2 years.
Children often have a rapidly progressive disease and
full blown AIDS occurring at 4 to 8 years of age.

1993 revised the classification system for HIV infection in
adults and children based on 2 parameters: clinical mani-
festations and CD4+ T cell counts. According to this classi-
fication, HIV-AIDS has 3 categories: A, B and C (Table 4.5).
Category A: Includes a variety of conditions: asymptomatic
case, persistent generalised lymphadenopathy (PGL), and
acute HIV syndrome. CD4+ T cell counts in clinical category
A are >500/μl.
Category B: Includes symptomatic cases and includes
conditions secondary to impaired cell-mediated immunity
e.g. bacillary dysentery, mucosal candidiasis, fever, oral hairy
leukoplakia, ITP, pelvic inflammatory disease, peripheral
neuropathy, cervical dysplasia and carcinoma in situ cervix
etc. CD4+ T cell counts in clinical category B are 200-499/μl.
Category C: This category includes conditions listed for AIDS
surveillance case definition. These are mucosal candidiasis,
cancer uterine cervix, bacterial infections (e.g. tuberculosis),
fungal infections (e.g. histoplasmosis), parasitic infections
(e.g. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia), malnutrition and
wasting of muscles etc. CD4+ T cell counts in clinical category
C are <200/μl and are indicator for AIDS.
Similarly, there are revised parameters for paediatric HIV
classification in which age-adjusted CD4+ T cell counts are
given which are relatively higher in each corresponding
category.
PATHOLOGICAL LESIONS AND CLINICAL MANIFES-
TATIONS OF HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS affects all body organs
and systems. In general, clinical manifestations and
pathological lesions in different organs and systems are
owing to progressive deterioration of body’s immune system.
Disease Progression occurs in all untreated patients, even if
the patient is apparently latent. Antiretroviral treatment
blocks and slows the progression of the disease. Pathological
lesions and clinical manifestations in HIV disease can be
explained by 4 mechanisms:
i. Due to viral infection directly: The major targets are immune
system, central nervous system and lymph nodes (persistent
generalised lymphadenopathy).
ii. Due to opportunistic infections: Deteriorating immune system
provides the body an opportunity to harbour micro-
organisms. A list of common opportunistic infectious agents
affecting HIV/AIDS is given in Fig. 4.6.
iii. Due to secondary tumours: End-stage of HIV/AIDS is
characterised by development of certain secondary malignant
tumours.
iv. Due to drug treatment: Drugs used in the treatment produce
toxic effects. These include antiretroviral treatment,
aggressive treatment of opportunistic infections and
tumours.
Based on above mechanisms, salient clinical features and
pathological lesions in different organs and systems are
briefly outlined below and illustrated in Fig. 4.6. However,
it may be mentioned here that many of the pathological
lesions given below may not become clinically apparent
during life and may be noted at autopsy alone.
1. Wasting syndrome. Most important systemic
manifestation corresponding to body’s declining immune
function is wasting syndrome defined as ‘involuntary loss
of body weight by more than 10%’. It occurs due to multiple
factors such as malnutrition, increased metabolic rate,
malabsorption, anorexia, and ill-effects of multiple
opportunistic infections.
2. Persistent generalised lymphadenopathy.  In early
asymptomatic stage during the course of disease, some
patients may develop persistent generalised lymphadeno-
pathy (PGL). PGL is defined as presence of enlarged lymph
nodes >1 cm at two or more extrainguinal sites for >3 months
without an obvious cause. There is marked cortical follicular
hyperplasia, due to proliferation of CD8+ T cells, B cells and
dendritic follicular histiocytes. HIV infected CD4+ T cells are
seen in the mantle zone. In advanced cases of AIDS, lymph
nodes show progressive depletion of lymphoid cells, or there
may be occurrence of opportunistic infection (e.g. M. avium
intracelluare, Histoplasma, Toxoplasma) or appearance of
secondary tumours in the lymphoid tissue (e.g. Kaposi’s
sarcoma, lymphoma).

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
3. GI lesions and manifestations. Almost all patients with
HIV infection develop gastrointestinal manifestations. These
include: chronic watery or bloody diarrhoea, oral, oropharyn-
geal and oesophageal candidiasis, anorexia, nausea,
vomiting, mucosal ulcers, abdominal pain.  These features
are due to opportunistic infections (e.g. Candida, Clostridium,
Shigella, Salmonella, Giardia, Entamoeba histolytica, Crypto-
sporium, CMV). Advance cases may develop secondary
tumours occurring in GIT (e.g. Kaposi’s sarcoma, lymphoma).
4. Pulmonary lesions and manifestations. Symptoms
pertaining to lungs develop in about 50-75% of cases and
are a major cause of death in HIV/AIDS. These features are
largely due to opportunistic infections causing pneumonia
e.g. with Pneumocystis carinii, M. tuberculosis, CMV, Histo-
plasma, and Staphylococci.  Lung abscess too may develop.
Other pulmonary manifestations include adult respiratory
distress syndrome and secondary tumours (e.g. Kaposi’s
sarcoma, lymphoma).
5. Mucocutaneous lesions and manifestations. Symptoms
due to mucocutaneous involvement occur in about 50 to 75%
cases. Mucocutaneous viral exanthem in the form of
erythematous rash is seen at the onset of primary infection
itself. Other mucocutaneous manifestations are allergic (e.g.
drug reaction, seborrhoeic dermatitis), infectious (viral
infections such as herpes, varicella zoster, EB virus, HPV;
bacterial infections such as M. avium, Staph. aureus; fungal
infections such as Candida, Cryptococcus, Histoplasma) and
neoplastic (e.g. Kaposi’s sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma,
basal cell carcinoma, cutaneous lymphoma).
6. Haematologic lesions and manifestations. Involvement
of haematopoietic system is common during the course of
HIV/AIDS. These include: anaemia, leucopenia, and
thrombocytopenia. These changes are due to bone marrow
suppression from several mechanisms: infections such as by
HIV, mycobacteria, fungi, and parvoviruses, or by
lymphomatous involvement.
7. CNS lesions and manifestations. Neurological
manifestations occur in almost all cases during the course of
disease and are an important cause of mortality and
morbidity. These may be inflammatory, demyelinating and
degenerative conditions. HIV encephalopathy or AIDS-
associated dementia complex, is an AIDS defining condition
and manifests clinically with deteriorating cognitive
symptoms. Other pathological lesions in HIV/AIDS are
meningitis (tuberculous, cryptococcal) demyelinating lesions
of the spinal cord, and peripheral neuropathy and lymphoma
of the brain.
8. Gynaecologic lesions and manifestations. Gynaecologic
symptoms are due to monilial (candidal) vaginitis, cervical
dysplasia, carcinoma cervix, and pelvic inflammatory
disease.
9. Renal lesions and manifestations. Features of renal
impairment may appear due to HIV-associated nephropathy
and genitourinary tract infections including pyelonephritis.
10. Hepatobiliary lesions and manifestations. Manifesta-
tions of hepatobiliary tract are due to development of
coinfection with hepatitis B or C, due to occurrence of other
infections and due to drug-induced hepatic injury. The
lesions include steatosis,  granulomatous hepatitis and
opportunistic infections (M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium
intracellulare, Histoplasma).
11. Cardiovascular lesions and manifestations. Heart
disease is common autopsy finding and include a form of
dilated cardiomyopathy called HIV-associated cardio-

Immunopathology Including Amyloidosis
myopathy, pericardial effusion in advanced disease as a
reaction to opportunistic infection, lymphoma and Kaposi’s
sarcoma.
12. Ophthalmic lesions. HIV associated ocular manifes-
tations occur from opportunistic infections (e.g. CMV
retinitis), HIV retinopathy, and secondary tumours.
13. Musculoskeletal lesions. These include osteoporosis,
osteopaenia, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis and polymyositis.
14. Endocrine lesions. Several metabolic derangements may
occur during the course of disease. There is syndrome of
lipodystrophy (buffalo hump) due to dyslipidaemia,
hyperinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia.  There may be
abnormality of thyroid function, hypogonadism and
inappropriate release of ADH.
LESIONS AND MANIFESTATIONS IN PAEDIATRIC
AIDS. Children develop clinical manifestations of AIDS more
rapidly than adults. Besides development of opportunistic
infections and tumours, neurologic impairment in children
causes slowing of development and growth.
DIAGNOSIS OF HIV/AIDS. The investigations of a
suspected case of HIV/AIDS are categorised into 3 groups:
tests for establishing HIV infection, tests for defects in
immunity, and tests for detection of opportunistic infections
and secondary tumours. However, usually initial testing for
antibodies is done against HIV by ELISA and confirmation
by Western blot or immunofluorescence test. These tests are
as under (Table 4.6):
1.
Tests for establishing HIV infection: These include
antibody tests and direct detection of HIV.
i) Antibody tests: These tests are as under:
a) ELISA. Initial screening is done by serologic test for
antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
against gag and env proteins. The term window period is used
for the initial 2 to 4 weeks period when the patient is
infectious but the screening test is negative, while serocon-
version is the term used for appearance of antibodies. Besides
window period, ELISA may be false positive in autoanti-
bodies, liver disease, recent vaccination against flu, and other
viral infections.
b) Western blot. If ELISA is positive, confirmation is done by
Western blot for presence of specific antibodies against all
three HIV antigens: gag, pol and env.
ii) Direct detection of HIV: These tests are as follows:
a)  p24 antigen capture assay.
b)  HIV RNA assay methods by reverse transcriptase (RT)
PCR, branched DNA, nucleic acid sequence-based
amplification (NucliSens).
c) DNA-PCR by amplification of proviral DNA.
d) Culture of HIV from blood monocytes and CD4+ T cells.
2.
Tests for defects in immunity: These tests are used for
diagnosis as well as for monitoring treatment of cases.
i)
CD4+ T cell counts. Progressive fall in number of CD4+ T
cells is of paramount importance in diagnosis and staging as
CDC categories described above.
ii)  Rise in CD8+ T cells.
iii) Reversal of CD4+ to CD8+ T cell ratio.
iv)  Lymphopenia.
v) Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia.
vi) Increased β-2 microglobulin levels.
vii)Platelet count revealing thrombocytopenia.
3. Tests for detection of opportunistic infections and
secondary tumours: Diagnosis of organs involved in
opportunistic infection and specific tumours secondary to
HIV/AIDS is made by aspiration or biopsy methods.
HYPERSENSITIVITY  REACTIONS
(IMMUNOLOGIC  TISSUE  INJURY)
Hypersensitivity is defined as an exaggerated or inappropriate state
of normal immune response with onset of adverse effects on the
body. The lesions of hypersensitivity are a form of antigen-
antibody reaction. These lesions are termed as hyper-
sensitivity reactions or immunologic tissue injury, of which
4 types are described: type I, II, III and IV.  Depending upon
the rapidity, duration and type of the immune response, these
4 types of hypersensitivity reactions are grouped into
immediate and delayed type:
1.
Immediate type in which on administration of antigen,
the reaction occurs immediately (within seconds to minutes).
Immune response in this type is mediated largely by humoral
antibodies (B cell mediated). Immediate type of hyper-
sensitivity  reactions includes type I, II and III.
2.
Delayed type in which the reaction is slower in onset
and develops within 24-48 hours and the effect is prolonged.
It is mediated by cellular response  (T cell mediated) and it
includes Type IV reaction.
The mechanisms and examples of immunologic tissue
injury by the 4 types of hypersensitivity reactions are
summarised in Table 4.7.
Type I: Anaphylactic (Atopic) Reaction
Type I hypersensitivity is defined as a state of rapidly
developing or anaphylactic type of immune response to an

antigen (i.e. allergen) to which the individual is previously
sensitised (anaphylaxis is the opposite of prophylaxis). The
reaction appears within 15-30 minutes of exposure to antigen.
ETIOLOGY. Type I reaction is mediated by humoral antibodies
of IgE type or reagin antibodies in response to antigen. Although
definite cause for this form of immediate reaction to allergen
is not known, following are the possible hypotheses:
1. Genetic basis. There is evidence that ability to respond to
antigen and produce IgE are both linked to genetic basis.
For example, there is a 50% chance that a child born to both
parents allergic to an antigen, may have similar allergy.
Further support to this basis comes from observations of high
levels of IgE in hypersensitive individuals and low level of
suppressor T cells that controls the immune response are
observed in persons with certain HLA types (in particular
HLA-B8).
2. Environmental pollutants. Another proposed hypothesis
is that environmental pollutants increase mucosal
permeability and thus may allow increased entry of allergen
into the body, which in turn leads to raised IgE level.
3. Concomitant factors. An alternate hypothesis is that
allergic response in type I reaction may be linked to
simultaneous occurrence of certain viral infections of upper
respiratory tract in a susceptible individual.
PATHOGENESIS. Type I reaction includes participation by
B lymphocytes and plasma cells, mast cells and basophils,
neutrophils and eosinophils. Its mechanism is schematically
shown in Fig. 4.7, A and is briefly outlined below:
i) During the first contact of the host with the antigen,
sensitisation takes place. In response to initial contact with
antigen, circulating B lymphocytes get activated and
differentiate to form IgE-secreting plasma cells.  IgE
antibodies so formed bind to the Fc receptors present in
plenty on the surface of mast cells and basophils, which are
the main effector cells of type I reaction. Thus, these cells are
now fully sensitised for the next event.
ii) During the second contact with the same antigen, IgE
antibodies on the surface of mast cells-basophils are so firmly
bound to Fc receptors that it sets in cell damage—membrane
lysis, influx of sodium and water and degranulation of mast
cells-basophils.
iii) The released granules contain important chemicals and
enzymes with proinflammatory properties— histamine, sero-
tonin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), chemotactic factors
of anaphylaxis for neutrophils and eosinophils, leukotrienes
B4 and D4, prostaglandins (thromboxane A2, prostaglandin
D2 and E2) and platelet activating factor. The effects of these
agents are:
increased vascular permeability;
smooth muscle contraction;
early vasoconstriction followed by vasodilatation;
shock;
increased gastric secretion;
increased nasal and lacrimal secretions; and
Increased migration of eosinophils and neutrophils at the
site of local injury as well as their rise in blood (eosinophilia
and neutrophilia).
EXAMPLES OF TYPE I REACTION. The manifestations of
type I reaction may be variable in severity and intensity. It
may manifest as a local irritant (skin, nose, throat, lungs etc),
or sometimes may be severe and life-threatening anaphylaxis.
Common allergens which may incite local or systemic type I
reaction are as under:

Local anaphylaxis:
i)
Hay fever (seasonal allergic rhinitis) due to pollen
sensitisation of conjunctiva and nasal passages.
ii) Bronchial asthma due to allergy to inhaled allergens like
house dust.
iii) Food allergy to ingested allergens like fish, cow’s milk,
eggs etc.
iv) Cutaneous anaphylaxis due to contact of antigen with
skin characterised by urticaria, wheal and flare.
v) Angioedema, an autosomal dominant inherited disorder
characterised by laryngeal oedema, oedema of eyelids, lips,
tongue and trunk.
Type II: Cytotoxic  (Cytolytic) Reaction
Type II or cytotoxic reaction is defined as reactions by
humoral antibodies that attack cell surface antigens on the
specific cells and tissues and cause lysis of target cells. Type
II reaction too appears generally within 15-30 minutes after
exposure to antigen but in myasthenia gravis and thyroiditis
it may appear after longer duration.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS. In general, type II
reactions have participation by complement system, tissue
macrophages, platelets, natural killer cells, neutrophils
and eosinophils while main antibodies are  IgG and IgM.
Type II hypersensitivity is tissue-specific and reaction
occurs after antibodies bind to tissue specific antigens,
most often on blood cells. The mechanism involved is as
under (Fig. 4.7, B):
 i) The antigen on the surface of target cell (foreign cell)
attracts and binds Fab portion of the antibody (IgG or IgM)
forming antigen-antibody complex.
ii) The unattached Fc fragment of antibodies (IgG or IgM)
forms a link between the antigen and complement.
iii) The antigen-antibody binding with Fc forming a link
causes activation of classical pathway of serum complement
which generates activated complement component, C3b, by
splitting C4 and C2 by C1.
iv)  Activated C3b bound to the target cell acts as an opsonin
and attracts phagocytes to the site of cell injury and initiates
phagocytosis.
v) Antigen-antibody complex also activates complement
system and exposes membrane attack complex (MAC) that
attacks and destroys the target cell.
EXAMPLES OF TYPE II REACTION. Examples of type II
reaction are mainly on blood cells and some other body cells
and tissues.
Cytotoxic antibodies to blood cells. Most common examples
of type II reaction are on blood cells.
i)
Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia in which the red cell injury
is brought about by autoantibodies reacting with antigens
present on red cell membrane. Antiglobulin test (direct
Coombs’ test) is employed to detect the antibody on red cell
surface (Chapter 12).
ii) Transfusion reactions due to incompatible or mismatched
blood transfusion.
iii) Haemolytic disease of the newborn (erythroblastosis
foetalis) in which the foetal red cells are destroyed by maternal
isoantibodies crossing the placenta.
iv) Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is the
immunologic destruction of platelets by autoantibodies
reacting with surface components of normal plaletets.
v) Leucopenia with agranulocytosis may be caused by
autoantibodies to leucocytes causing their destruction.
vi) Drug-induced cytotoxic antibodies are formed in response
to administration of certain drugs like penicillin, methyl
dopa, rifampicin etc. The drugs or their metabolites act as
haptens binding to the surface of blood cells to which the
antibodies combine, bringing about destruction of cells.
2.
Cytotoxic antibodies to tissue components. Cellular
injury may be brought about by autoantibodies reacting with
some components of tissue cells in certain diseases.
i)
In Graves’ disease (primary hyperthyroidism), thyroid
autoantibody is formed which reacts with the TSH receptor
to cause hyperfunction and proliferation.
ii) In myasthenia gravis, antibody to acetylcholine receptors
of skeletal muscle is formed which blocks the neuromuscular
transmission at the motor end-plate, resulting in muscle
weakness.
iii) In male sterility, antisperm antibody is formed which
reacts with spermatozoa and causes impaired motility as well
as cellular injury.
iv) In type 1 diabetes mellitus, islet cell autoantibodies are
formed which react against islet cell tissue.
v) In hyperacute rejection reaction, antibodies are formed
against donor antigen.
Type III: Immune Complex Mediated (Arthus) Reaction
Type III reactions result from deposition of antigen-antibody
complexes on tissues, which is followed by activation of the
complement system and inflammatory reaction, resulting in
cell injury. The onset of type III reaction takes place  about 6
hours after exposure to the antigen.
ETIOLOGY. Type III reaction is not tissue specific and occurs
when antigen-antibody complexes fail to get removed by the
body’s immune system. There can be 3 types of possible
etiologic factors precipitating type III reaction:
1. Persistence of low-grade microbial infection. A low-
grade infection with bacteria or viruses stimulates a
somewhat weak antibody response. Persistence of infection
(antigen) and corresponding weak antibody response leads
to chronic antigen-antibody complex formation. Since these
complexes fail to get eliminated from body fluids, they are
instead deposited in tissues e.g. in blood vessel wall,
glomeruli, joint tissue etc.
2. Extrinsic environmental antigen. Exogenous antigens
may be inhaled into the lungs e.g. antigens derived from
moulds, plants or animals. The inhaled antigen combines
with antibody in the alveolar fluid and forms antigen-
antibody complex which is deposited in the alveolar walls.
3. Autoimmune process. Another sequence in type III
reaction can be formation of autoantibodies against own
tissue (self antigen) forming autoantibody-self antigen
complex. Such self antigens can be circulating (e.g. IgA) or
tissue derived (e.g. DNA).  Immune complexes containing
both components from body’s own system can thus be
deposited in tissues.

77
CHAPTER 4
Immunopathology Including Amyloidosis
PATHOGENESIS. It may be mentioned here that both type
II and type III reactions have antigen-antibody complex
formation but the two can be distinguished— antigen in type
II is tissue specific while in type III is not so; moreover the
mechanism of cell injury in type II is direct but in type III it
is by deposition of antigen-antibody complex on tissues and
subsequent sequence of cell injury takes place.
Type III reaction has participation by IgG and IgM
antibodies, neutrophils, mast cells and complement. The
sequence of underlying mechanism is as under (Fig. 4.7, C):
i) Immune complexes are formed by interaction of soluble
antibody and soluble or insoluble antigen.
ii) Immune complexes which fail to get removed from body
fluid get deposited into tissues. Generally, small and
intermediate sized antibodies and antigens precipitate out
of the body fluid and get deposited in tissues.
iii) Fc component of antibody links with complement and
activates classical pathway of complement resulting in
formation of C3a, C5a and membrane attack complex.
iv) C3a stimulates release of histamine from mast cells and
its resultant effects of increased vascular permeability and
oedema.
v) C5a releases proinflammatory mediators and chemotactic
agents for neutrophils.
vi) Accumulated neutrophils and macrophages in the tissue
release cytokines and result in tissue destruction.
EXAMPLES OF TYPE III REACTION. Common examples
of cell injury by type III injury are as under:
i)  Immune complex glomerulonephritis in which the antigen
may be GBM or exogenous agents (e.g. Streptococcal
antigen).
ii)  Goodpasture  syndrome having GBM as antigen.
 iii) SLE in which there is nuclear antigen (DNA, RNA) and
there is formation of anti-nuclear and anti-DNA
autoantibodies.
iv) Rheumatoid arthritis in which there is nuclear antigen.
v) Farmer’s lung in which actinomycetes-contaminated hay
acts as antigen.
vi) Polyarteritis nodosa and Wegener’s granulomatosis with
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antigen.
vii) Henoch-Schönlein purpura in which respiratory viruses
act as antigen.
viii) Drug-induced vasculitis in which the drug acts as
antigen.
Type IV: Delayed Hypersensitivity (Cell-Mediated)
Reaction
Type IV or delayed hypersensitivity reaction is tissue injury
by cell mediated immune response without formation of
antibodies (contrary to type I, II and III) but is instead a slow
and prolonged response of specifically-sensitised T
lymphocytes. The reaction occurs about 24 hours after
exposure to antigen and the effect is prolonged which may
last up to 14 days.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS. Type IV reaction
involves role of mast cells and basophils, macrophages and
CD8+ T cells. Briefly, the mechanism of type IV reaction is
as under (Fig. 4.7, D):
i) The antigen is recognised by CD8+ T cells (cytotoxic T cells)
and is processed by antigen presenting cells.
ii) Antigen-presenting cells migrate to lymph node where
antigen is presented to helper T cells (CD4+ T cells).
iii) Helper T cells release cytokines that stimulate T cell
proliferation and activate macrophages.
iv) Activated T cells and macrophages release proinflam-
matory mediators and cause cell destruction.
EXAMPLES OF TYPE IV REACTION. Type IV reaction can
explain tissue injury in following common examples:
1. Reaction against mycobacterial infection e.g. tuberculin
reaction, granulomatous reaction in tuberculosis, leprosy.
2. Reaction against virally infected cells.
3. Reaction against malignant cells in the body.
4. Reaction against organ transplantation e.g. transplant
rejection, graft versus host reaction.
AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES
Autoimmunity is a state in which the body’s immune system
fails to distinguish between ‘self’ and ‘non-self’ and reacts
by formation of autoantibodies against one’s own tissue
antigens. In other words, there is loss of tolerance to one’s
own tissues; autoimmunity is the opposite of immune tolerance.
Immune tolerance is a normal phenomenon present since
foetal life and is defined as the ability of an individual to
recognise self tissue and antigens. Normally, the immune
system of the body is able to distinguish self from non-self
antigens by the following mechanisms:
1.
Clonal elimination. According to this theory, during
embryonic development, T cells maturing in the thymus
acquire the ability to distinguish self from non-self. These T
cells are then eliminated by apoptosis for the tolerant
individual.
2.
Concept of clonal anergy. According to this mechanism, T
lymphocytes which have acquired the ability to distinguish
self from non-self are not eliminated but instead become non-
responsive and inactive.
3.
Suppressor T cells. According to this mechanism, the
tolerance is achieved by a population of specific suppressor
T cells which do not allow the antigen-responsive cells to
proliferate and differentiate.
PATHOGENESIS (THEORIES) OF AUTOIMMUNITY
The mechanisms by which the immune tolerance of the body
is broken causes autoimmunity. These mechanisms or
theories of autoimmunity may be immunological, genetic,
and microbial, all of which may be interacting.
1.
Immunological factors. Failure of immunological
mechanisms of tolerance initiates autoimmunity. These
mechanisms are as follows:
i)
Polyclonal activation of B cells. B cells may be directly
activated by stimuli such as infection with microorganisms
and their products leading to bypassing of T cell tolerance.
ii) Generation of self-reacting B cell clones may also lead to
bypassing of T cell tolerance.
iii) Decreased T suppressor and increased T helper cell activity.
Loss of T suppressor cell and increase in T helper cell

78
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
activities may lead to high levels of auto-antibody production
by B cells contributing to auto-immunity.
iv) Fluctuation of anti-idiotype network control may cause failure
of mechanisms of immune tolerance.
v) Sequestered antigen released from tissues. ‘Self-antigen’
which is completely sequestered may act as ‘foreign-antigen’
if introduced into the circulation later. For example, in trauma
to the testis, there is formation of anti-sperm antibodies
against spermatozoa; similar is the formation of
autoantibodies against lens crystallin.
2.
Genetic factors. There is evidence in support of genetic
factors in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity as under:
i)
There is increased expression of Class II HLA antigens on
tissues involved in autoimmunity.
ii) There is increased familial incidence of some of the
autoimmune disorders.
3.
Microbial factors. Infection with microorganisms,
particularly viruses (e.g. EBV infection), and less often
bacteria (e.g. streptococci, Klebsiella) and mycoplasma, has
been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.
However, a definite evidence in support is lacking.
TYPES AND EXAMPLES OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES
Depending upon the type of autoantibody formation, the
autoimmune diseases are broadly classified into 2 groups:
1.
Organ specific diseases. In these, the autoantibodies
formed react specifically against an organ or target tissue
component and cause its chronic inflammatory destruction.
The tissues affected are endocrine glands (e.g. thyroid,
pancreatic islets of Langerhans, adrenal cortex), alimentary
tract, blood cells and various other tissues and organs.
2.
Organ non-specific (Systemic) diseases. These are
diseases in which a number of autoantibodies are formed
which react with antigens in many tissues and thus cause
systemic lesions. The examples of this group are various
systemic collagen diseases.
However, a few autoimmune diseases overlap between
these two main categories.
Based on these 2 main groups, a comprehensive list of
autoimmune (or collagen) diseases is presented in Table 4.8.
Some of the systemic autoimmune diseases (marked with
asterisk) are discussed in this chapter while others from both
the groups are described later in the relevant chapters.
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
SLE is the classical example of systemic autoimmune or
collagen diseases. The disease derives its name ‘lupus’ from
the Latin word meaning ‘wolf’ since initially this disease was
believed to affect skin only and eat away skin like a wolf.
However, now 2 forms of lupus erythematosus are described:
1.
Systemic or disseminated form is characterised by acute
and chronic inflammatory lesions widely scattered in the
body and there is presence of various nuclear and
cytoplasmic autoantibodies in the plasma.
2.
Discoid form is characterised by chronic and localised
skin lesions involving the bridge of nose and adjacent cheeks
without any systemic manifestations. Rarely, discoid form
may develop into disseminated form.
ETIOLOGY. The exact etiology of SLE is not known.
However, autoantibodies against nuclear and cytoplasmic
components of the cells are demonstrable in plasma by
immunofluorescence tests in almost all cases of SLE. Some
of the important antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) or antinuclear
factors (ANFs) against different nuclear antigens are  as
under:
i)
Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are the antibodies against
common nuclear antigen that includes DNA as well as RNA.
These are demonstrable in about 98% cases and is the best
as screening test.
ii) Antibodies to double-stranded (anti-dsDNA)  is the most
specific  for SLE, especially in high titres, and is present in
70%  cases.
iii) Anti-Smith antibodies (anti-Sm), in which antibodies
appear against Smith antigen which is part of

Immunopathology Including Amyloidosis
ribonucleoproteins. It is also specific for SLE but is seen in
about 25% cases.
iv) Other non-specific antibodies. Besides above, there are
several other antibody tests which lack specificity for SLE.
These are as follows:
a)
Anti-ribonucleoproteins (anti-RNP) seen in 40% cases of SLE
but seen more often in Sjögren’s syndrome.
b) Anti-histone antibody, which is antibody against histone
associated with DNA in chromatin, is seen particularly in
cases of drug-induced lupus than in SLE.
c)
Antiphospholipid antibodies or lupus anticoagulant are tests
for thrombotic complications in cases of SLE.
d) Antiribosomal P antibody is antibody against protein in
ribosomes and is seen in CNS lupus.
The source of these autoantibodies as well as hyper-
gammaglobulinaemia seen in SLE is the polyclonal activa-
tion of B cells brought about by following derangements:
1.
Immunologic factors. These include:
i)
an inherited defect in B cells;
ii) stimulation of B cells by micro-organisms;
iii) T helper cell hyperactivity; and
iv) T suppressor cell defect.
2.
Genetic factors. Genetic predisposition to develop auto-
antibodies to nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens in SLE is due
to the immunoregulatory function of class II HLA genes
implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE.
3.
Other factors. Various other factors express the genetic
susceptibility of an individual to develop clinical disease.
These factors are:
i)
certain drugs e.g. penicillamine D;
ii) certain viral infections e.g. EBV infection; and
iii) certain hormones e.g. oestrogen.
PATHOGENESIS. The autoantibodies formed by any of the
above mechanisms are the mediators of tissue injury in SLE.
Two types of immunologic tissue injury can occur in SLE:
1.
Type II hypersensitivity is characterised by formation of
autoantibodies against blood cells (red blood cells, platelets,
leucocytes) and results in haematologic derangement in SLE.
2.
Type III hypersensitivity is characterised by antigen-anti-
body complex (commonly DNA-anti-DNA antibody;
sometimes Ig-anti-Ig antibody complex) which is deposited
at sites such as renal glomeruli, walls of small blood vessels
etc.
LE CELL PHENOMENON. This was the first diagnostic
laboratory test described for SLE. The test is based on the
principle that ANAs cannot penetrate the intact cells and thus
cell nuclei should be exposed to bind them with the ANAs.
The binding of exposed nucleus with ANAs results in
homogeneous mass of nuclear chromatin material which is
called LE body or haematoxylin body.
LE cell is a phagocytic leucocyte, commonly polymorpho-
nuclear neutrophil, and sometimes a monocyte, which
engulfs the homogeneous nuclear material of the injured cell.
For demonstration of LE cell phenomenon in vitro, the blood
sample is traumatised to expose the nuclei of blood
leucocytes to ANAs. This results in binding of denatured
and damaged nucleus with ANAs. The ANA-coated
denatured nucleus is chemotactic for phagocytic cells.
If this mass is engulfed by a neutrophil, displacing the
nucleus of neutrophil to the rim of the cell, it is called LE cell
(Fig. 4.8,A).
If the mass, more often an intact lymphocyte, is phago-
cytosed by a monocyte, it is called Tart cell (Fig. 4.8,B).
LE cell test is positive in 70% cases of SLE while newer
and more sensitive immunofluorescence tests for auto-
antibodies listed above are positive in almost all cases of SLE.
A few other conditions may also show positive LE test e.g.
rheumatoid arthritis, lupoid hepatitis, penicillin sensitivity
etc.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The manifestations of SLE
are widespread in different visceral organs as well as show
erythematous cutaneous eruptions. The principal lesions
are renal, vascular, cutaneous and cardiac; other organs
and tissues involved are serosal linings (pleuritis,
pericarditis); joints (synovitis); spleen (vasculitis); liver
(portal triaditis); lungs (interstitial pneumonitis, fibros-
ing alveolitis), CNS (vasculitis) and in blood (autoimmune
haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopaenia).
Histologically, the characteristic lesion in SLE is fibrinoid
necrosis which may be seen in the connective tissue,
beneath the endothelium in small blood vessels, under
the mesothelial lining of pleura and pericardium, under
the endothelium in endocardium, or under the synovial
lining cells of joints.
Table 4.9 summarises the morphology of lesions in
different organs and tissues in SLE.
CLINICAL FEATURES. SLE, like most other autoimmune
diseases, is more common in women in their 2nd to 3rd
decades of life. As obvious from Table 4.9, SLE is a
multisystem disease and thus a wide variety of clinical
Figure 4.8

masses of amorphous nuclear material (LE body) which has displaced

system, lungs, heart and blood vessels, GI system, and
haematopoietic system. Fatigue and myalgia are present in
most cases throughout the course of disease. Severe form of
illness occurs with fever, weight loss, anaemia and organ
related manifestations.
For making the diagnosis of SLE, four or more of the
following diagnostic criteria need to be fulfilled:
1.
Malar rash characterised by fixed erythema, flat or raised
over malar (mala= zygomatic bone) eminences.
2.
Discoid rash characterised by erythematous circular raised
patches with keratotic scaling or follicular plugging.
3.
Photosensitivity seen as rash on exposure to sunlight.
4.
Oral ulcers which may extend to nasopharynx.
5.
Non-erosive arthritis affecting two or more joints; may be
associated with tenderness, swelling and effusion.
6.
Serositis as pleuritis or pericarditis.
7.
Renal manifestations seen as proteinuria >0.5 gm/dl (>3+)
and cellular casts.
8.
Neurologic manifestations seen as seizures or psychosis.
9.
Haematologic derangements seen as haemolytic anaemia, or
thrombocytopenia (<100,000/μl), or leucopenia (>4,000/μl).
10. Immunological derangements seen as positive tests for anti-
dsDNA, antiSm, and/or anti-phospholipid antibody.
11. Antinuclear antibodies seen as abnormal titre of ANA by
immunofluorescence or any other equivalent method.
The disease usually runs a long course of flare-ups and
remissions; renal failure is the most frequent cause of death.
Scleroderma (Progressive Systemic Sclerosis)
Just like SLE, scleroderma was initially described as a skin
disease characterised by progressive fibrosis. But now, 2 main
types are recognised:
1.
Diffuse scleroderma in which the skin shows widespread
involvement and may progress to involve visceral structures.
2.
CREST syndrome of progressive systemic sclerosis
characterised by Calcinosis (C), Raynaud’s phenomenon (R),
Esophageal hypomotility (E), Sclerodactyly (S) and
Telangiectasia (T).
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The etiology of this disease is not
known. However, antinuclear antibodies are detected in
majority of cases of systemic sclerosis. Immunologic
mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
lesions in systemic sclerosis which finally cause activation
of fibroblasts. The immune mechanisms leading to stimulation
of fibroblasts may act in the following ways:
1.
Elaboration of cytokines such as by fibroblast growth factor
and chemotactic factors by activated T cells and
macrophages.
2.
Endothelial cell injury due to cytotoxic damage to endo-
thelium from autoantibodies or antigen-antibody complexes.
This results in aggregation and activation of platelets which
increases vascular permeability and stimulates fibroblastic
proliferation.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Disseminated visceral
involvement as well as cutaneous lesions are seen in
systemic sclerosis.

features may be present. The severity of disease varies from
mild to intermittent to severe and fulminant. Usually targeted
organs are musculoskeletal system, skin, kidneys, nervous

CHAPTER 4
Immunopathology Including Amyloidosis
1.
Skin changes. Skin is involved diffusely, beginning
distally from fingers and extending proximally to arms,
shoulders, neck and face. In advanced stage, the fingers
become claw-like and face mask-like.
Microscopically, changes are progressive from early to
late stage.
Early stage shows oedema and degeneration of
collagen. The small-sized blood vessels are occluded and
there is perivascular infiltrate of mononuclear cells.
Late stage reveals thin and flat epidermis. Dermis is
largely replaced by compact collagen and there is hyaline
thickening of walls of dermal blood vessels. In advanced
cases subcutaneous calcification may occur.
2.
Kidney changes. Involvement of kidneys is seen in
majority of cases of systemic sclerosis. The lesions are
prominent in the walls of interlobular arteries which
develop changes resembling malignant hypertension.
There is thickening of tunica intima due to concentric
proliferation of intimal cells and fibrinoid necrosis of
vessel wall.
3.
Smooth muscle of GIT. Muscularis of the alimentary
tract, particularly oesophagus, is progressively atrophied
and replaced by fibrous tissue.
4.
Skeletal muscle. The interstitium of skeletal muscle
shows progressive fibrosis and degeneration of muscle
fibres with associated inflammatory changes.
5.
Cardiac muscle. Involvement of interstitium of the
heart may result in heart failure.
6.
Lungs. Diffuse fibrosis may lead to contraction of the
lung substance. There may be epithelium-lined honey-
combed cysts of bronchioles.
7.
Small arteries. The lesions in small arteries show
endarteritis due to intimal proliferation and may be the
cause for Raynaud’s phenomenon.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Systemic sclerosis is more common
in middle-aged women. The clinical manifestations include:
claw-like flexion deformity of hands;
Raynaud’s phenomenon;
oesophageal fibrosis causing dysphagia and
hypomotility;
malabsorption syndrome;
respiratory distress;
malignant hypertension;
pulmonary hypertension; and
biliary cirrhosis.
Polymyositis-Dermatomyositis
As the name suggests, this disease is a combination of
symmetric muscle weakness and skin rash.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The exact cause of the disease is
unknown. However, antinuclear antibodies are detected in
25% of cases. Thus, an immunologic hypothesis has been
proposed. The affected muscles are infiltrated by sensitised
T lymphocytes of both T helper and T suppressor type which
are considered to bring about inflammatory destruction of
muscle. Viral etiology due to infection with coxsackie B virus
has also been suggested.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The skeletal muscles
usually affected are of pelvis, shoulders, neck, chest and
diaphragm.
Histologically, vacuolisation and fragmentation of muscle
fibres and numerous inflammatory cells are present. In
late stage, muscle fibres are replaced by fat and fibrous
tissue.
CLINICAL FEATURES. It is a multi-system disease
characterised by:
muscle weakness, mainly proximal;
skin rash, typically with heliotropic erythema and
periorbital oedema;
dysphagia due to involvement of pharyngeal muscles;
respiratory dysfunction; and
association with deep-seated malignancies.
Sjögren’s Syndrome
Sjögren’s syndrome is characterised by the triad of dry eyes
(keratoconjunctivitis sicca), dry mouth (xerostomia), and
rheumatoid arthritis. The combination of the former two
symptoms is called sicca syndrome.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Immune mechanisms have been
implicated in the etiopathogenesis of lesions in Sjögren’s
syndrome. Antinuclear antibodies are found in about 90%
of cases; test for rheumatoid factor is positive in 25% of cases.
The lesions in lacrimal and salivary glands are mediated by
T lymphocytes, B cells and plasma cells.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. In early stage, the lacrimal
and salivary glands show periductal infiltration by
lymphocytes and plasma cells, which at times may form
lymphoid follicles (pseudolymphoma). In late stage,
glandular parenchyma is replaced by fat and fibrous
tissue. The ducts are also fibrosed and hyalinised.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The disease is common in women
in 4th to 6th decades of life. It is clinically characterised by:
Symptoms referable to eyes such as blurred vision, burning
and itching.
Symptoms referable to xerostomia such as fissured oral
mucosa, dryness, and difficulty in swallowing.
Symptoms due to glandular involvement such as enlar-
ged and inflamed lacrimal gland (Mikulicz’s syndrome is
involvement of parotid alongwith lacrimal gland).
Symptoms due to systemic involvement referable to lungs,
CNS and skin.
Reiter’s Syndrome
This syndrome is characterised by triad of arthritis,
conjunctivitis and urethritis. There may be mucocutaneous
lesions on palms, soles, oral mucosa and genitalia.
Antinuclear antibodies and RA factor are usually negative.

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
AMYLOIDOSIS
Amyloidosis is the term used for a group of diseases charac-
terised by extracellular deposition of fibrillar proteinaceous
substance called amyloid having common morphological
appearance, staining properties and physical structure but
with variable protein (or biochemical) composition.
First described by Rokitansky in 1842, the substance was
subsequently named by Virchow as ‘amyloid’ under the
mistaken belief that the material was starch-like (amylon =
starch). This property was demonstrable grossly on the cut
surface of an organ containing amyloid which stained brown
with iodine and turned violet on addition of dilute sulfuric
acid. By H&E staining under light microscopy, amyloid
appears as extracellular, homogeneous, structureless and
eosinophilic hyaline material; it stains positive with Congo red
staining and shows apple-green birefringence on polarising
microscopy.
The nomenclature of different forms of amyloid is done
by putting the alphabet A (A for amyloid), followed by the
suffix derived from the name of specific protein constituting
amyloid of that type e.g. AL (A for amyloid, L for light chain-
derived), AA, ATTR etc.
PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL NATURE OF AMYLOID
Ultrastructural examination and chemical analysis reveal the
complex nature of amyloid. It emerges that on the basis of
morphology and physical characteristics, all forms of amyloid are
similar in appearance, but they are chemically heterogeneous.
Based on these analysis, amyloid is composed of 2 main types
of complex proteins (Fig. 4.9):
I.
Fibril proteins comprise about 95% of amyloid.
II. Non-fibrillar components which include P-component
predominantly; there are several different proteins which
together constitute the remaining 5% of amyloid.
I. Fibril Proteins
By electron microscopy, it became apparent that major
component of all forms of amyloid (about 95%) consists of
meshwork of fibril proteins. The fibrils are delicate, randomly
dispersed, non-branching, each measuring 7.5-10 nm in
diameter and having indefinite length. Each fibril is further
composed of double helix of two pleated sheets in the form
of twin filaments separated by a clear space. By X-ray
crystallography and infra-red spectroscopy, the fibrils are
shown to have cross-β-pleated sheet configuration which
produces 1000 A° periodicity that gives the characteristic
staining properties of amyloid with Congo red and
birefringence under polarising microscopy. Based on these
features amyloid is also referred to as β-fibrillosis.
Chemical analysis of fibril proteins of amyloid reveals
heterogeneous nature of amyloid. Chemically two major
forms of amyloid fibril proteins were first identified in 1970s
while currently  20 biochemically different proteins are
known to form amyloid fibrils in humans in different
clinicopathologic settings. Thus these proteins can be
categorised as under:
i)
AL (amyloid light chain) protein
ii) AA (amyloid associated) protein
iii) Other proteins
AL PROTEIN. AL amyloid fibril protein is derived from
immunoglobulin light chain, which in most cases includes
amino-terminal segment of the immunoglobulin light chain
Figure 4.9
Diagrammatic representation of the ultrastructure of amyloid. A, Electron microscopy shows major part consisting of amyloid fibrils
(95%) randomly oriented, while the minor part is essentially P-component (5%) B, Each fibril is further composed of double helix of two pleated
sheets in the form of twin filaments separated by a clear space. P-component has a pentagonal or doughnut profile. C, X-ray crystallography and
infra-red spectroscopy shows fibrils having cross-β-pleated sheet configuration which produces periodicity that gives the characteristic staining
properties of amyloid with Congo red and birefringence under polarising microscopy.

83
CHAPTER 4
Immunopathology Including Amyloidosis
and part of C region. AL fibril protein is more frequently
derived from the lambda (λ) light chain than kappa (κ), the
former being twice more common. However, in any given
case, there is amino acid sequence homology.
AL type of fibril protein is produced by immunoglobulin-
secreting cells and is therefore seen in association with plasma
cell dyscrasias and is included in primary systemic
amyloidosis.
AA PROTEIN. AA fibril protein is composed of protein with
molecular weight of 8.5-kD which is derived from larger
precursor protein in the serum called SAA (serum amyloid-
associated protein) with a molecular weight of 12.5-kD.
Unlike AL amyloid, the deposits of AA amyloid do not have
sequence homology. In the plasma, SAA circulates in
association with HDL3 (high-density lipoprotein). SAA is an
acute phase reactant protein synthesised in the liver, its level
being high in chronic inflammatory and traumatic conditions.
SAA fibril protein is found in secondary amyloidosis
which includes the largest group of diseases associated with
amyloidosis.
OTHER PROTEINS. Apart from the two major forms of
amyloid fibril proteins, a few other forms of proteins are
found in different clinical states:
1.
Transthyretin (TTR). It is a serum protein synthesised
in the liver and transports thyroxine and retinol normally
(trans-thy-retin).  It was earlier called AFp (amyloid familial
prealbumin) since it precedes albumin (pre-albumin) on
serum electrophoresis but is not related to serum albumin.
Single amino acid substitution mutations in the structure of
TTR results in variant form of protein which is responsible
for this form of amyloidosis termed as ATTR. About 60 such
mutations have been described.
ATTR is the most common form of heredofamilial
amyloidosis e.g. in familial amyloid polyneuropathies.
However, the deposits of ATTR in the elderly primarily
involving the heart (senile cardiac amyloidosis) consists of
normal TTR without any mutation. Another interesting
aspect in ATTR is that despite being inherited, the disease
appears in middle age or elderly.
2.
Aβββββ2-microglobulin (Aβββββ2M). This form of amyloid is seen
in cases of long-term haemodialysis (for 8-10 years). As the
name suggests, β2M is a small protein which is a normal
component of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and
has β -pleated sheet structure.  β2M is not effectively filtered
during haemodialysis and thus there is high serum
concentration of  β2M protein in these patients. Although
the deposit due to Aβ2M may be systemic in distribution, it
has  predilection for bones and joints.
3.
βββββ-amyloid protein (Aβββββ). Aβ is distinct from Aβ2M and is
seen in cerebral plaques as well as cerebral blood vessels in
Alzheimer’s disease. Aβ is derived from amyloid beta
precursor protein (AβPP) which is a transmembrane
glycoprotein. The normal function of βPP is probably cell-
to-matrix signalling.
4. Immunoglobulin heavy chain amyloid (AH). AH is
derived from truncated heavy chain of immunoglobulin and
is an uncommon form of systemic amyloidosis.
5.
Amyloid from hormone precursor proteins. It includes
examples such as amyloid derived from pro-calcitonin
(ACal), islet amyloid polypeptide (AIAPP, Amylin), pro-
insulin (AIns), prolactin (APro), atrial natriuretic factor
(AANF), and lactoferrin (ALac).
6. Amyloid of prion protein (APrP).  It is derived from
precursor prion protein which is a plasma membrane
glycoprotein. Prion proteins are proteinaceous infectious
particles lacking in RNA or DNA. Amyloid in prionosis
occurs due to abnormally folded isoform of the PrP.
7. Miscellaneous heredofamilial forms of amyloid. This
group includes a variety of amyloid proteins reported
recently. These are amyloid derived from: apolipoprotein I
(AApoAI), gelsolin (AGel), lysozyme (ALys), fibrinogen α-
chain (AFib), lysozyme (ALys), cystatin C (ACys) and
amyloid of familial dementia etc.
II. Non-fibrillar Components
Non-fibrillar components comprise about 5% of the amyloid
material. These include the following:
1.
Amyloid P (AP)-component.  It is synthesised in the liver
and is present in all types of amyloid. It is derived from
circulating serum amyloid P-component, a glycoprotein
resembling the normal serum α1-glycoprotein and is PAS-
positive. It is structurally related to C-reactive protein, an
acute phase reactant, but is not similar to it. By electron
microscopy, it has a pentagonal profile (P-component) or
doughnut-shape with an external diameter of 9 nm and
internal diameter of 4 nm.
2. Apolipoprotein-E (apoE). It is a regulator of lipoprotein
metabolism and is found in all types of amyloid. One allele,
apoE4, increases the risk of Alzheimer precursor protein
(APP) deposition in Alzheimer’s disease but not in all other
types of amyloid deposits.
3.
Sulfated glycosaminoglycans(GAGs). These are
constituents of matrix proteins; particularly associated is
heparan sulfate in all types of tissue amyloid.
4.
ααααα-1 anti-chymotrypsin. It is seen in cases of AA deposits
only but not seen in primary amyloidosis.
5.
Protein X. This protein has been shown to be present in
cases of prionoses.
6.
Other components. Besides above, components of
complement, proteases, and membrane constituents may be
seen.
PATHOGENESIS OF AMYLOIDOSIS
The earliest observation that amyloidosis developed in
experimental animals who were injected repeatedly with
antigen to raise antisera for human use led to the concept
that amyloidogenesis was the result of immunologic
mechanisms. AL variety of amyloid protein was thus first to
be isolated. It is now appreciated that amyloidosis or
fibrillogenesis is multifactorial and that different mechanisms
are involved in different types of amyloid.
Irrespective of the type of amyloid, amyloidogenesis in
general in vivo, occurs in the following sequence (Fig. 4.10):

84
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
1.
Pool of amyloidogenic precursor protein is present in
circulation in different clinical settings and in response to
stimuli e.g. increased hepatic synthesis of AA or ATTR,
increased synthesis of AL etc.
2.
A nidus for fibrillogenesis, meaning thereby an alteration
in microenvironment, to stimulate deposition of amyloid
protein is formed. This alteration involves changes and
interaction between basement membrane proteins  and
amyloidogenic protein.
3.
Partial degradation or proteolysis occurs prior to deposition
of fibrillar protein which may occur in macrophages or
reticuloendothelial cells e.g. partial degradation of AL, AA.
4. Exceptions to this generalisation, however, are seen in ATTR
(heredofamilial type in which there are amino acid mutations
in most cases), Aβ2M (in which there are elevated levels of
normal β2M protein which remain unfiltered during
haemodialysis) and prionosis (in which β-pleated sheet is
formed de novo).
5. The role of non-fibrillar components such as AP, apoE and
GAGs in amyloidosis is unclear; probably they facilitate in
aggregation of proteins and protein folding leading to fibril
formation, substrate adhesion and protection from
degradation.
Based on this general pathogenesis, deposition of AL and
AA amyloid is briefly outlined below:
Deposition of AL Amyloid
1.
The stimulus for production of AL amyloid is some
disorder of immunoglobulin synthesis e.g. multiple myeloma,
B cell lymphoma, other plasma cell dyscrasias.
2.
Excessive immunoglobulin production is in the form of
monoclonal gammopathy i.e. there is production of either intact

Pathogenesis of two main forms of amyloid deposition (AL = Amyloid light chain; AA = Amyloid-associated protein; GAG =
glycosaminoglycan; AP = Amyloid P component). The sequence on left shows general schematic representation common to both major forms of
amyloidogenesis.

CHAPTER 4
Immunopathology Including Amyloidosis
immunoglobulin, or λ light chain, or κ light chain, or rarely
heavy chains. This takes place by monoclonal proliferation
of plasma cells, B lymphocytes, or their precursors.
3.
Partial degradation in the form of limited proteolysis of
larger protein molecules occurs in macrophages that are
anatomically closely associated with AL amyloid.
4. Non-fibrillar components like AP and GAGs play some role
in folding and aggregation of fibril proteins.
Deposition of AA Amyloid
1.
AA amyloid is directly related to SAA levels, a high-
density lipoprotein. SAA is synthesised by the liver in
response to cytokines, notably interleukin 1 and 6, released
from activated macrophages.
2.
The levels of SAA are elevated in long-standing tissue
destruction e.g. in chronic inflammation, cancers. However,
SAA levels in isolation do not always lead to AA amyloid.
3.
As in AL amyloid, partial degradation in the form of limited
proteolysis takes place in reticuloendothelial cells.
4.
In AA amyloid, a significant role is played by another
glycoprotein, amyloid enhancing  factor (AEF). The exact
composition of AEF is not known. AEF is elaborated in
chronic inflammation, cancer and familial Mediterranean
fever. On the basis of experimental induction of AA amyloid,
AEF has been shown to accelerate AA amyloid deposition.
Possibly, AEF acts as a nidus for deposition of fibrils in AA
amyloid.
5.
As in AL amyloid, there is a role of AP component and
glycosaminoglycans in the fibril protein aggregation and to
protect it from disaggregation again.
CLASSIFICATION OF AMYLOIDOSIS
Over the years, amyloidosis has been classified in a number
of ways:
Based on cause, into primary (with unknown cause and
the deposition is in the disease itself) and secondary  (as a
complication of some underlying known disease)
amyloidosis.
Based on extent of amyloid deposition, into systemic
(generalised) involving multiple organs and localised
amyloidosis involving one or two organs or sites.
Based on histological basis, into pericollagenous (corres-
ponding in distribution to primary amyloidosis), and
perireticulin (corresponding in distribution to secondary
amyloidosis).
Based on clinical location, into pattern I (involving
tongue, heart, bowel, skeletal and smooth muscle, skin and
nerves), pattern II (principally involving liver, spleen, kidney
and adrenals) and mixed pattern (involving sites of both
pattern I and II).
Based on tissues in which amyloid is deposited, into
mesenchymal (organs derived from mesoderm) and
parenchymal (organs derived from ectoderm and endoderm)
amyloidosis.
Based on precursor biochemical proteins, into specific
type of serum amyloid proteins.
With availability of biochemical composition of various
forms of amyloid and diverse clinical settings in which these
specific biochemical forms of amyloid are deposited, a
clinicopathologic classification has been proposed which is
widely acceptable (Table 4.10).  According to this
classification, amyloidosis can be divided into 2 major
categories and their subtypes depending upon clinical
settings:
A. Systemic (generalised) amyloidosis:
1.
Primary (AL)
2.
Secondary/reactive/ inflammatory (AA)

A. SYSTEMIC AMYLOIDOSIS
1. Primary Systemic (AL) Amyloidosis
Primary amyloidosis consisting of AL fibril proteins is
systemic or generalised in distribution.  About 30% cases of
AL amyloid have some form of plasma cell dyscrasias, most
commonly multiple myeloma (in about 10% cases), and less
often other monoclonal gammopathies such as
Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia, heavy chain disease,
solitary plasmacytoma and nodular malignant lymphoma
(B cell lymphoma). The neoplastic plasma cells usually are a
single clone and, therefore, produce the same type of
immunoglobulin light chain or part of light chain. Almost
all cases of multiple myeloma have either λ or κ light chains
(Bence Jones proteins) in the serum and are excreted in the
urine. However, in contrast to normal or myeloma light
chains, AL is twice more frequently derived from λ light
chains.
The remaining 70% cases of AL amyloid do not have
evident B-cell proliferative disorder or any other associated
diseases and are thus cases of true ‘primary’ (idiopathic)
amyloidosis. However, by more sensitive methods, some
plasma cell dyscrasias are detectable in virtually all patients
with AL. Majority of these cases too have a single type of
abnormal immunoglobulin in their serum (monoclonal) and
that these patients have some degree of plasmacytosis in the
bone marrow, suggesting the origin of AL amyloid from
precursor plasma cells.
AL amyloid is most prevalent type of systemic
amyloidosis in North America and Europe and is seen in
individuals past the age of 40 years. Primary amyloidosis is
often severe in the heart, kidney, bowel, skin, peripheral
nerves, respiratory tract, skeletal muscle, and other organs.
Recently, it has been possible to reproduce AL amyloid
in mice by repeated injections of human amyloidogenic light
chains. Treatment of AL amyloid is targetted at reducing the
underlying clonal expansion of plasma cells.
2. Secondary/Reactive (AA) Systemic Amyloidosis
The second form of systemic or generalised amyloidosis is
reactive or inflammatory or secondary in which the fibril
proteins contain AA amyloid. Secondary or reactive
amyloidosis occurs typically as a complication of chronic
infectious (e.g. tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, chronic
osteomyelitis, chronic pyelonephritis, leprosy, chronic skin
infections), non-infectious chronic inflammatory conditions
associated with tissue destruction (e.g. autoimmune
disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel
disease), some tumours (e.g. renal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin’s
disease) and in familial Mediterranean fever, an inherited
disorder (discussed below).
Secondary amyloidosis is typically distributed in solid
abdominal viscera like the kidney, liver, spleen and adrenals.
Secondary reactive amyloidosis is seen less frequently in
developed countries due to containment of infections before
they become chronic but this is the more common type of
amyloidosis in underdeveloped and developing countries
of the world. Secondary systemic amyloidosis can occur at
any age including children.
AA amyloid occurs spontaneously in some birds
and animals; it can also be experimentally induced in
animals.
The contrasting features of the two main forms of
systemic amyloidosis are given in Table 4.11.
3. Haemodialysis-Associated (Ab2M) Amyloidosis
Patients on long-term dialysis for more than 10 years for
chronic renal failure may develop systemic amyloidosis
derived from β2-microglobulin which is normal component
of MHC. The amyloid deposits are preferentially found in

the vessel walls at the synovium, joints, tendon sheaths and
subchondral bones. However, systemic distribution has also
been observed in these cases showing bulky visceral deposits
of amyloid.
4. Heredofamilial Amyloidosis
A few rare examples of genetically-determined amyloidosis
having familial occurrence and seen in certain geographic
regions have been described. These are as under:
i)
Hereditary polyneuropathic (ATTR) amyloidosis. This
is an autosomal dominant disorder in which amyloid is
deposited in the peripheral and autonomic nerves resulting
in muscular weakness, pain and paraesthesia, or may have
cardiomyopathy. This type of amyloid is derived from
transthyretin (ATTR) with single amino acid substitution in
the structure of TTR; about 60 types of such mutations have
been described. Though hereditary, the condition appears
well past middle life.
ii) Amyloid in familial Mediterranean fever (AA). This is
an autosomal recessive disease and is seen in the
Mediterranean region (i.e. people residing in the countries
surrounding the Mediterranean sea e.g. Sephardic Jews,
Armenians, Arabs and Turks). The condition is characterised
by periodic attacks of fever and polyserositis i.e.
inflammatory involvement of the pleura, peritoneum, and
synovium causing pain in the chest, abdomen and joints
respectively. Amyloidosis occurring in these cases is AA
type, suggesting relationship to secondary amyloidosis due
to chronic inflammation. The distribution of this form of
heredofamilial amyloidosis is similar to that of secondary
amyloidosis.
iii) Rare hereditary forms. Heredofamilial mutations of
several normal proteins have been reported e.g. apolipo-
protein I (AApoAI), gelsolin (AGel), lysozyme (ALys),
fibrinogen α-chain (AFib), cystatin C (ACys) and amyloid of
familial dementia etc. These types may also result in systemic
amyloidosis.
B. LOCALISED AMYLOIDOSIS
1.
Senile cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR). Senile cardiac amy-
loidosis is seen in 50% of people above the age of 70 years.
The deposits are seen in the heart and aorta. The type of
amyloid in these cases is ATTR but without any change in
the protein structure of TTR.
2.
Senile cerebral amyloidosis (Aβββββ, APrP). Senile cerebral
amyloidosis is heterogeneous group of amyloid deposition
of varying etiologies that includes sporadic, familial,
hereditary and infectious. Some of the important diseases
associated with cerebral amyloidosis and the corresponding
amyloid proteins are: Alzheimer’s disease (Aβ), Down’s
syndrome (Aβ) and transmissible spongiform encephalo-
pathies (APrP) such as in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fatal
familial insomnia, mad cow disease, kuru.
In Alzheimer’s disease, deposit of amyloid is seen as
Congophilic angiopathy (amyloid material in the walls of
cerebral blood vessels),  neurofibrillary tangles and in senile
plaques.
3.
Endocrine amyloidosis (Hormone precursors). Some
endocrine lesions are associated with microscopic deposits
of amyloid. The examples are as follows:
i)  Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (from procalcitonin
i.e. ACal).
ii) Islet cell tumour of the pancreas (from islet amyloid
polypeptide i.e. AIAPP or Amylin).
iii) Type 2 diabetes mellitus (from pro-insulin, i.e. AIns).
iv) Pituitary amyloid (from prolactin i.e. APro).
v) Isolated atrial amyloid deposits (from atrial natriuretic
factor i.e. AANF).
vi) Familial corneal amyloidosis (from lactoferrin i.e. ALac).
4. Localised tumour forming amyloid (AL). Sometimes,
isolated tumour like formation of amyloid deposits are seen
e.g. in lungs, larynx, skin, urinary bladder, tongue, eye,
isolated atrial amyloid. In most of these cases, the amyloid
type is AL.
STAINING CHARACTERISTICS OF AMYLOID
1. STAIN ON GROSS. The oldest method since the time of
Virchow for demonstrating amyloid on cut surface of a gross
specimen, or on the frozen/paraffin section is iodine stain.
Lugol’s iodine imparts mahogany brown colour to the amyloid-
containing area which on addition of dilute sulfuric acid turns
blue. This starch-like property of amyloid is due to AP
component, a glycoprotein, present in all forms of amyloid.
Various stains and techniques employed to distinguish
and confirm amyloid deposits in sections are as given in
Table 4.12.
2.
H & E. Amyloid by light microscopy with haematoxylin
and eosin staining appears as extracellular, homogeneous,
structureless and eosinophilic hyaline material, especially in
relation to blood vessels. However, if the deposits are small,
they are difficult to detect by routine H and E stains. Besides,
a few other hyaline deposits may also take pink colour (page
35).
3.
METACHROMATIC STAINS (ROSANILINE DYES).
Amyloid has the property of metachromasia i.e. the dye
reacts with amyloid and undergoes a colour change.
TABLE 4.12: Staining Characteristics of Amyloid.

iii) PAS
Pink

88
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
Metachromatic stains employed are rosaniline dyes such as
methyl violet and crystal violet which impart rose-pink
colouration to amyloid deposits. However, small amounts
of amyloid are missed, mucins also have metachromasia and
that aqueous mountants are required for seeing the
preparation.  Therefore, this method has low sensitivity and
lacks specificity.
4.
CONGO RED AND POLARISED LIGHT. All types of
amyloid have affinity for Congo red stain; therefore this
method is used for confirmation of amyloid of all types. The
stain may be used on both gross specimens and microscopic
sections; amyloid of all types stains pink red colour. If the
stained section is viewed in polarised light, the amyloid
characteristically shows apple-green birefringence due to cross-
β-pleated sheet configuration of amyloid fibrils. The stain
can also be used to distinguish between AL and AA amyloid
(primary and secondary amyloid respectively). After prior
treatment with permanganate or trypsin on the section,
Congo red stain is repeated—in the case of primary amyloid
(AL amyloid), the Congo red positivity (congophilia)
persists,* while it turns negative for Congo red in secondary
amyloid (AA amyloid). Congo red dye can also be used as
an in vivo test (described below).
5.
FLUORESCENT STAINS. Fluorescent stain thioflavin-
T binds to amyloid and fluoresce yellow under ultraviolet
light i.e. amyloid emits secondary fluorescence. Thioflavin-
S is less specific.
6. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY. More recently, type of
amyloid can be classified by immunohistochemical stains.
Various antibody stains against the specific antigenic
protein types of amyloid are commercially available.
However, most useful in confirmation for presence of
amyloid of any type is anti-AP stain; others for determining
the biochemical type of amyloid include anti-AA, anti-lambda
(λ), anti- kappa (κ) antibody stains etc.
7. NON-SPECIFIC STAINS. A few other stains have been
described for amyloid at different times but they lack
specificity. These are as under:
i) Standard toluidine blue: This method gives orthochromatic
blue colour to amyloid which under polarising microscopy
produces dark red birefringence. However, there are false
positive as well as false negative results; hence not
recommended.
ii) Alcian blue: It imparts blue-green colour to amyloid
positive areas and is used for mucopolysaccharide content
in amyloid but uptake of dye is poor and variable.
iii) Periodic acid Schiff (PAS): It is used for demonstration
of  carbohydrate content of amyloid but shows variable
positivity and is not specific.
DIAGNOSIS OF AMYLOIDOSIS
Amyloidosis may be detected as an unsuspected morpho-
logic finding in a case, or the changes may be severe so as to
produce symptoms and may even cause death. The diagnosis
of amyloid disease can be made from the following
investigations:
1.
BIOPSY EXAMINATION. Histologic examination of
biopsy material is the commonest and confirmatory method
for diagnosis in a suspected case of amyloidosis. Biopsy of
an obviously affected organ is likely to offer the best results
e.g. kidney biopsy in a case of dialysis, sural nerve biopsy in
familial polyneuropathy. In systemic amyloidosis, renal
biopsy provides the best detection rate, but rectal biopsy also
has a good pick up rate. However, gingiva and skin biopsy
have poor result. Currently, fine needle aspiration of
abdominal subcutaneous fat followed by Congo red staining
and polarising microscopic examination for confirmation has
become an acceptable simple and useful technique with
excellent result.
2.
IN VIVO CONGO RED TEST. A known quantity of
Congo red dye may be injected intravenously in living
patient. If amyloidosis is present, the dye gets bound to
amyloid deposits and its levels in blood rapidly decline. The
test is, however, not popular due to the risk of anaphylaxis
to the injected dye.
3.
OTHER TESTS. A few other tests which are not
diagnostic but are supportive of amyloid disease are protein
electrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis of urine and serum,
and bone marrow aspiration.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES OF
AMYLOIDOSIS OF ORGANS
Although amyloidosis of different organs shows variation
in morphologic pattern, some features are applicable in
general to most of the involved organs.
Sites of Amyloid Deposits. In general, amyloid proteins get
filtered from blood across the basement membrane of
vascular capillaries into extravascular spaces.  Thus, most
commonly amyloid deposits appear at the contacts between
the vascular spaces and parenchymal cells, in the
Figure 4.11
Amyloidosis of kidney. The kidney is small and pale in
colour. Sectioned surface shows loss of cortico-medullary distinction
(arrow) and pale, waxy translucency.
*Easy way to remember: Three ps i.e. there is persistence of
congophilia after permanganate treatment in primary amyloid.

89
CHAPTER 4
Immunopathology Including Amyloidosis
extracellular matrix and within the basement membranes of
blood vessels.
Grossly, the affected organ is usually enlarged, pale and
rubbery. Cut surface shows firm, waxy and translucent
parenchyma which takes positive staining with the iodine
test.
Microscopically, the deposits of amyloid are found in the
extracellular locations, initially in the walls of small blood
vessels producing microscopic changes and effects, while
later the deposits are in large amounts causing
macroscopic changes and effects of pressure atrophy.
Based on these general features of amyloidosis, the salient
pathologic findings of major organ involvements are
described below.
Amyloidosis of Kidneys
Amyloidosis of the kidneys is most common and most
serious because of ill-effects on renal function. The deposits
in the kidneys are found in most cases of secondary
amyloidosis and in about one-third cases of primary
amyloidosis. Amyloidosis of the kidney accounts for about
20% of deaths from amyloidosis. Even small quantities of
amyloid deposits in the glomeruli can cause proteinuria and
nephrotic syndrome.
Grossly, the kidneys may be normal-sized, enlarged or
terminally contracted due to ischaemic effect of narrowing
of vascular lumina. Cut surface is pale, waxy and
translucent (Fig. 4.11).
Microscopically, amyloid deposition occurs primarily in
the glomeruli, though it may involve peritubular
interstitial tissue and the walls of arterioles as well
(Fig. 4.12):
In the glomeruli, the deposits initially appear on the
basement membrane of the glomerular capillaries, but
later extend to produce luminal narrowing and distortion
of the glomerular capillary tuft. This results in abnormal
increase in permeability of the glomerular capillaries to
macromolecules with consequent proteinuria and
nephrotic syndrome.
In the tubules, the amyloid deposits likewise begin close
to the tubular epithelial basement membrane. Subse-
quently, the deposits may extend further outwards into
the intertubular connective tissue, and inwards to produce
degenerative changes in the tubular epithelial cells and
amyloid casts in the tubular lumina.
Vascular involvement affects chiefly the walls of small
arterioles and venules, producing narrowing of their
lumina and consequent ischaemic effects.
Figure 4.12
Amyloidosis of kidney. The amyloid deposits are seen mainly in the glomerular capillary tuft. The deposits are also present in
peritubular connective tissue producing atrophic tubules and amyloid casts in the tubular lumina, and in the arterial wall producing luminal narrowing.

deposits are seen mainly in the glomerular capillary tuft stained red-pink
(Congophilia). B, Viewing the same under polarising microscopy, the
congophilic areas show apple-green birefringence.

90
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
Congo red staining showing red pink colour and
polarising microscopy showing apple-green birefringence
confirms the presence of amyloid (Fig. 4.13).
Amyloidosis of Spleen
Amyloid deposition in the spleen, for some unknown
reasons, may have one of the following two patterns
(Fig. 4.14):
1.
SAGO SPLEEN. The splenomegaly is not marked and
cut surface shows characteristic translucent pale and waxy
nodules resembling sago grains and hence the name.
Microscopically, the amyloid deposits begin in the walls
of the arterioles of the white pulp and may subsequently
replace the follicles.
2.
LARDACEOUS SPLEEN. There is generally moderate
to marked splenomegaly (weight up to 1 kg). Cut surface
of the spleen shows map-like areas of amyloid
(lardaceous-lard-like; lard means fat of pigs) (Fig. 4.15).
Microscopically, the deposits involve the walls of splenic
sinuses and the small arteries and in the connective tissue
of the red pulp (Fig. 4.16). Confirmation is by seeing
Congophilia in Congo Red staining and demonstration
of apple-green birefringence under polarising microscopy
in the corresponding positive areas.
Amyloidosis of Liver
In about half the cases of systemic amyloidosis, liver
involvement by amyloidosis is seen.
Grossly, the liver is often enlarged, pale, waxy and firm.
Histologically, the features are as under (Fig. 4.17):
The amyloid initially appears in the space of Disse
(the space between the hepatocytes and sinusoidal
endothelial cells).

in the space of Disse causing compression and pressure atrophy of
hepatocytes. B, Congo red staining shows congophilia which under
polarising microscopy. C, shows apple-green birefringence.
Later, as the deposits increases, they compress the
cords of hepatocytes so that eventually the liver cells
are shrunken and atrophic and replaced by amyloid.
However, hepatic function remains normal even at an
advanced stage of the disease.
To a lesser extent, portal tracts and Kupffer cells are
involved in amyloidosis.

92
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
Amyloidosis of Heart
Heart is involved in systemic amyloidosis quite commonly,
more so in the primary than in secondary systemic
amyloidosis. It may also be involved in localised form of
amyloidosis (senile cardiac and AANF). In advanced cases,
there may be a pressure atrophy of the myocardial fibres and
impaired ventricular function which may produce restrictive
cardiomyopathy. Amyloidosis of the heart may produce
arrhythmias due to deposition in the conduction system.
Grossly, the heart may be enlarged. The external surface
is pale, translucent and waxy. The epicardium,
endocardium and valves show tiny nodular deposits or
raised plaques of amyloid.
Microscopically, the changes are as under:
Amyloid deposits are seen in and around the
coronaries and their small branches.
In cases of primary amyloidosis of the heart, the
deposits of AL amyloid are seen around the myocardial
fibres in ring-like formations (ring fibres).
In localised form of amyloid of the heart, the deposits
are seen in the left atrium and in the interatrial septum.
Amyloidosis of Alimentary Tract
Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract by amyloidosis may
occur at any level from the oral cavity to the anus. Rectal
and gingival biopsies are the common sites for diagnosis of
systemic amyloidosis. The deposits are initially located
around the small blood vessels but later may involve adjacent
layers of the bowel wall. Tongue may be the site for tumour-
forming amyloid, producing macroglossia.
Other Organs
Uncommonly, the deposits of amyloid may occur in various
other tissues such as pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, skin, lymph
nodes, respiratory tract and peripheral and autonomic
nerves.
PROGNOSIS OF AMYLOIDOSIS
Amyloidosis may be an incidental finding at autopsy or in
symptomatic cases diagnosis can be made from the methods
given above, biopsy examination being the most important
method. The prognosis of patients with generalised
amyloidosis is generally poor. Primary amyloidosis, if left
untreated, is rapidly progressive and fatal. Therapy in these
cases is directed at reducing the clonal marrow plasma cells
as is done for treatment of multiple myeloma. For secondary
reactive amyloidosis, control of inflammation is the mainstay
of treatment. Secondary amyloidosis has somewhat better
outcome due to controllable underlying condition.
Renal failure and cardiac arrhythmias are the most
common causes of death in most cases of systemic
amyloidosis.

HOMEOSTASIS
Many workers have pointed out that life on earth probably
arose in the sea, and that the body water which is the
environment of the cells, consisting of “salt water” is similar
to the ancient ocean. The sea within us flows through blood
and lymph vessels, bathes the cells as well as lies within the
cells. However, water within us contains several salts that
includes sodium, chloride, potassium, calcium, magnesium,
phosphate, and other electrolytes. Although it appears quite
tempting to draw comparison between environment of the
cell and the ancient oceans, it would be rather an
oversimplification in considering the cellular environment
to be wholly fluid ignoring the presence of cells, fibres and
ground substance.
Claude Bernarde (1949) first coined the term internal
environment or milieu interieur for the state in the body in
which the interstitial fluid that bathes the cells and the
plasma, together maintain the normal morphology and
function of the cells and tissues of the body. The mechanism
by which the constancy of the internal environment is
maintained and ensured is called the homeostasis. For this
purpose, living membranes with varying permeabilities such
as vascular endothelium and the cell wall play important
role in exchange of fluids, electrolytes, nutrients and
metabolites across the compartments of body fluids.
The normal composition of internal environment consists
of the following components (Fig. 5.1):
1.
WATER. Water is the principal and essential constituent
of the body. The total body water in a normal adult male
comprises 50-70% (average 60%) of the body weight and
about 10% less in a normal adult female (average 50%). Thus,
the body of a normal male weighing 65 kg contains
approximately 40 litres of water. The total body water
(assuming average of 60%) is distributed into 2 main
compartments of body fluids separated from each other by
membranes freely permeable to water. These are as under
(Fig. 5.2):
i)
Intracellular fluid compartment. This comprises about
33% of the body weight, the bulk of which is contained in
the muscles.
ii) Extracellular fluid compartment. This constitutes the
remaining 27% of body weight containing water. Included
in this are the following 4 subdivisions of extracellular fluid
(ECF):
a) Interstitial fluid including lymph fluid constitutes the major
proportion of ECF (12% of body weight).
b) Intravascular fluid or blood plasma comprises about 5% of
the body weight. Thus plasma content is about 3 litres of
fluid out of 5 litres of total blood volume.
c)
Mesenchymal tissues such as dense connective tissue,
cartilage and bone contain body water that comprises about
9% of the body weight.
d) Transcellular fluid constitutes 1% of body weight. This is
the fluid contained in the secretions of secretory cells of the
body e.g. skin, salivary glands, mucous membranes of
alimentary and respiratory tracts, pancreas, liver and biliary
tract, kidneys, gonads, thyroid, lacrimal gland and CSF.
2.
ELECTROLYTES. The concentration of cations
(positively charged) and anions (negatively charged) is
different in intracellular and extracellular fluids:
Figure 5.1
Distribution of body fluid compartments.
Figure 5.2
Body fluid compartments (ICF = intracellular fluid
compartment; ECF = extracellular fluid compartment).

94
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
In the intracellular fluid, the main cations are potassium
and magnesium and the main anions are phosphates and
proteins. It has low concentration of sodium and chloride.
In the extracellular fluid, the predominant cation is sodium
and the principal anions are chloride and bicarbonate. Besides
these, a small proportion of non-diffusible proteins and some
diffusible nutrients and metabolites such as glucose and urea
are present in the ECF.
The essential difference between the two main sub-
divisions of ECF is the higher protein content in the plasma
than in the interstitial fluid which plays an important role in
maintaining fluid balance.
The major functions of electrolytes are as follows:
i)
Electrolytes are the main solutes in the body fluids for
maintenance of acid-base equilibrium.
ii) Electrolytes maintain the proper osmolality and volume
of body fluids (Osmolality is the solute concentration per kg
water, compared from osmolarity which is the solute
concentration per litre solution).
iii) The concentration of certain electrolytes determines their
specific physiologic functions e.g. the effect of calcium ions
on neuromuscular excitability. The concentration of the major
electrolytes is expressed in milliequivalent (mEq) per litre
so as to compare the values directly with each other. In order
to convert mg per dl into mEq per litre the following formula
is used:
 mg/dl
mEq/L = _____________________ × 10
    
Eq weight of element
NORMAL WATER AND ELECTROLYTE BALANCE
(GIBBS-DONNAN EQUILIBRIUM)
Normally, a state of balance exists between the amount of
water absorbed into the body and that which is eliminated
from the body. The water as well as electrolytes are
distributed nearly constantly in different body fluid
compartments:
1.
Water is normally absorbed into the body from the bowel
or is introduced parenterally; average intake being 2800 ml
per day.
2.
Water is eliminated from the body via:
kidneys in the urine (average 1500 ml per day);
via the skin as insensible loss in perspiration or as sweat
(average 800 ml per day), though there is wide variation in
loss via sweat depending upon weather, temperature, fever
and exercise;
via the lungs in exhaled air (average 400 ml per day);
and
minor losses via the faeces (average 100 ml per day) and
lacrimal, nasal, oral, sexual and mammary (milk) secretions.
The cell wall as well as capillary endothelium are enti-
rely permeable to water but they differ in their permeability
to electrolytes. Capillary wall is completely permeable to
electrolytes while the cell membrane is somewhat
impermeable. As mentioned earlier, concentration of
potassium and phosphate are high in the intracellular fluid
whereas concentration of sodium and chloride are high in
the ECF. The osmotic equilibrium between the two major
body fluid compartments is maintained by the passage of
water from or into the intracellular compartment. The 2 main
subdivisions of ECF—blood plasma and interstitial fluid, are
separated from each other by capillary wall which is freely
permeable to water but does not allow free passage of macro-
molecules of plasma proteins resulting in higher protein
content in the plasma.
ACID-BASE BALANCE
Besides changes in the volume of fluids in the compartments,
changes in ionic equilibrium affecting the acid-base balance
of fluids occur. In terms of body fluids,
an acid is a molecule or ion which is capable of giving off
a hydrogen ion (H+ ion donor); and
a base is a molecule or ion which is capable of taking up
hydrogen ion (H+ ion acceptor).
A number of acids such as carbonic, phosphoric, sulfuric,
lactic, hydrochloric and ketoacids are formed during normal
metabolic activity. However, carbonic acid is produced in
largest amount as it is the end-product of aerobic tissue
activity. In spite of these acids, the pH of the blood is kept
constant at 7.4 + 0.05 in health.
The pH of blood and acid-base balance are regulated in
the body as follows.
1.
BUFFER SYSTEM. Buffers are substances which have
weak acids and strong bases and limit the change in H+ ion
concentration to the normal range. They are the first line of
defense for maintaining acid-base balance and do so by
taking up H+ ions when the pH rises. The most important
buffer which regulates the pH of blood is bicarbonate-carbonic
acid system followed by intracellular buffering action of
haemoglobin and carbonic anhydrase in the red cells.
2.
PULMONARY MECHANISM. During respiration, CO2
is removed by the lungs depending upon the partial pressure
of CO2 in the arterial blood. With ingestion of high quantity
of acid-forming salts, ventilation is increased as seen in
acidosis in diabetic ketosis and uraemia.
3.
RENAL MECHANISM. The other route by which H+
ions can be excreted from the body is in the urine. Here, H+
ions secreted by the renal tubular cells are buffered in the
glomerular filtrate by:
combining with phosphates to form phosphoric acid;
combining with ammonia to form ammonium ions; and
combining with filtered bicarbonate ions to form carbonic
acid.
However, carbonic acid formed is dissociated to form CO2
which diffuses back into the blood to reform bicarbonate ions.
PRESSURE GRADIENTS AND FLUID EXCHANGES
Aside from water and electrolytes or crystalloids, both of
which are freely interchanged between the interstitial fluid
and plasma, the ECF contains colloids (i.e. proteins) which
minimally cross the capillary wall. These substances exert
pressures responsible for exchange between the interstitial
fluid and plasma.

95
CHAPTER 5
Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics
Normal Fluid Pressures
1.
OSMOTIC PRESSURE. This is the pressure exerted by
the chemical constituents of the body fluids. Accordingly,
osmotic pressure may be of the following types (Fig. 5.3,A):
Crystalloid osmotic pressure exerted by electrolytes
present in the ECF and comprises the major portion of the
total osmotic pressure.
Colloid osmotic pressure (Oncotic pressure) exerted by
proteins present in the ECF and constitutes a small part of
the total osmotic pressure but is more significant
physiologically. Since the protein content of the plasma is
higher than that of interstitial fluid, oncotic pressure of
plasma is higher (average 25 mmHg) than that of interstitial
fluid (average 8 mmHg).
Effective oncotic pressure is the difference between the
higher oncotic pressure of plasma and the lower oncotic
pressure of interstitial fluid and is the force that tends to draw
fluid into the vessels.
2.
HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE. This is the capillary blood
pressure.
There is considerable pressure gradient at the two ends of
capillary loop—being higher at the arteriolar end (average
32 mmHg) than at the venular end (average 12 mmHg).
Tissue tension is the hydrostatic pressure of interstitial
fluid and is lower than the hydrostatic pressure in the
capillary at either end (average 4 mmHg).
Effective hydrostatic pressure is the difference between
the higher hydrostatic pressure in the capillary and the lower
tissue tension; it is the force that drives fluid through the capillary
wall into the interstitial space.
Normal Fluid Exchanges
Normally, the fluid exchanges between the body
compartments take place as under:
At the arteriolar end of the capillary, the balance between
the hydrostatic pressure (32 mmHg) and plasma oncotic
pressure (25 mmHg) is the hydrostatic pressure of 7 mmHg
which is the outward-driving force so that a small quantity
of fluid and solutes leave the vessel to enter the interstitial
space.

and hypoproteinaemia. C, Mechanism of oedema by increased hydrostatic pressure in the capillary. D, Mechanism of lymphoedema.
E, Mechanism by tissue factors (increased oncotic pressure of interstitial fluid and lowered tissue tension). F, Mechanism of oedema by increased
capillary permeability.

96
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
At the venular end of the capillary, the balance between the
hydrostatic pressure (12 mmHg) and plasma oncotic pressure
(25 mmHg) is the oncotic pressure of 13 mmHg which is the
inward-driving force so that the fluid and solutes re-enter
the plasma.
The tissue fluid left after exchanges across the capillary
wall escapes into the lymphatics from where it is finally
drained into venous circulation.
Tissue factors i.e. oncotic pressure of interstitial fluid and
tissue tension, are normally small and insignificant forces
opposing the plasma hydrostatic pressure and capillary
hydrostatic pressure, respectively.
DISTURBANCES OF BODY FLUIDS
The common derangements of body fluid are as follows:
1.
Oedema
2.
Dehydration
3.
Overhydration
These are discussed below.
OEDEMA
DEFINITION AND TYPES
The Greek word oidema means swelling. Oedema may be
defined as abnormal and excessive accumulation of “free fluid” in
the interstitial tissue spaces and serous cavities. The presence of
abnormal collection of fluid within the cell is sometimes
called intracellular oedema but should more appropriately
be called hydropic degeneration (page 34).
Free fluid in body cavities: Dpending upon the body cavity
in which the fluid accumulates, it is correspondingly known
as ascites (if in the peritoneal cavity), hydrothorax or pleural
effusion (if in the pleural cavity), and hydropericardium or
pericardial effusion (if in the pericardial cavity).
Free fluid in interstitial space: The oedema fluid lies free in
the interstitial space between the cells and can be displaced
from one place to another. In the case of oedema in the
subcutaneous tissues, momentary pressure of finger
produces a depression known as pitting oedema. The other
variety is non-pitting or solid oedema in which no pitting is
produced on pressure e.g. in myxoedema, elephantiasis.
The oedema may be of 2 main types:
1.
Localised when limited to an organ or limb e.g. lymphatic
oedema, inflammatory oedema, allergic oedema.
2.
Generalised (anasarca or dropsy) when it is systemic in
distribution, particularly noticeable in the subcutaneous
tissues e.g. renal oedema, cardiac oedema, nutritional
oedema.
Besides, there are a few special forms of oedema (e.g.
pulmonary oedema, cerebal oedema) discussed later.
Depending upon fluid composition, oedema fluid may
be:
transudate which is more often the case, such as in oedema
of cardiac and renal disease; or
exudate such as in inflammatory oedema.
The differences between transudate and exudate are
tabulated in Table 5.1.
PATHOGENESIS OF OEDEMA
Oedema is caused by mechanisms that interfere with normal
fluid balance of plasma, interstitial fluid and lymph flow.
The following mechanisms may be operating singly or in
combination to produce oedema:
1.
Decreased plasma oncotic pressure
2.
Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure
3.
Lymphatic obstruction
4.
Tissue factors (increased oncotic pressure of interstitial
fluid, and decreased tissue tension)
5.
Increased capillary permeability
6.
Sodium and water retention.
These mechanisms are discussed below and illustrated
in Fig. 5.3:
1.
DECREASED PLASMA ONCOTIC PRESSURE. The
plasma oncotic pressure exerted by the total amount of
plasma proteins tends to draw fluid into the vessels normally.
A fall in the total plasma protein level (hypoproteinaemia of
less than 5 g/dl), results in lowering of plasma oncotic

CHAPTER 5
Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics
pressure in a way that it can no longer counteract the effect
of hydrostatic pressure of blood. This results in increased
outward movement of fluid from the capillary wall and
decreased inward movement of fluid from the interstitial
space causing oedema (Fig. 5.3,B). Hypoproteinaemia
usually produces generalised oedema (anasarca). Out of the
various plasma proteins, albumin has four times higher
plasma oncotic pressure than globulin; thus it is mainly hypo-
albuminaemia (albumin below 2.5 g/dl) that results in
oedema more often.
The examples of oedema by this mechanism are seen in
the following conditions:
i)
Oedema of renal disease e.g. in nephrotic syndrome, acute
glomerulonephritis.
ii) Ascites of liver disease e.g. in cirrhosis of the liver.
iii) Oedema due to other causes of hypoproteinaemia e.g. in
protein-losing enteropathy.
2. INCREASED CAPILLARY HYDROSTATIC PRES-
SURE. The hydrostatic pressure of the capillary is the force
that normally tends to drive fluid through the capillary
wall into the interstitial space by counteracting the force
of plasma oncotic pressure. A rise in the hydrostatic
pressure at the venular end of the capillary which is
normally low (average 12 mmHg) to a level more than the
plasma oncotic pressure results in minimal or no
reabsorption of fluid at the venular end, consequently
leading to oedema (Fig. 5.3,C).
The examples of oedema by this mechanism are seen in
the following disorders:
i)
Oedema of cardiac disease e.g. in congestive cardiac failure,
constrictive pericarditis.
ii) Ascites of liver disease e.g. in cirrhosis of the liver.
iii) Passive congestion e.g. in mechanical obstruction due to
thrombosis of veins of the lower legs, varicosities, pressure
by pregnant uterus, tumours etc.
iv) Postural oedema e.g. transient oedema of feet and ankles
due to increased venous pressure seen in individuals who
remain standing erect for longtime such as traffic constables.
3.
LYMPHATIC OBSTRUCTION. Normally, the inter-
stitial fluid in the tissue spaces escapes by way of lympha-
tics. Obstruction to outflow of these channels causes localised
oedema, known as lymphoedema (Fig. 5.3,D).
The examples of lymphoedema include the following:
i)
Removal of axillary lymph nodes in radical mastectomy for
carcinoma of the breast produces lymphoedema of the
affected arm.
ii) Pressure from outside on the main abdominal or thoracic
duct such as due to tumours, effusions in serous cavities etc
may produce lymphoedema. At times, the main lymphatic
channel may rupture and discharge chyle into the pleural
cavity (chylothorax) or into peritoneal cavity (chylous
ascites).
iii) Inflammation of the lymphatics as seen in filariasis (infection
with Wuchereria bancrofti) results in chronic lymphoedema
of scrotum and legs known as elephantiasis.
iv) Occlusion of lymphatic channels by malignant cells may
result in lymphoedema.
v) Milroy’s disease or hereditary lymphoedema is due to
abnormal development of lymphatic channels. It is seen in
families and the oedema is mainly confined to one or both
the lower limbs (Chapter 15).
4.
TISSUE FACTORS. The two forces acting in the inter-
stitial space—oncotic pressure of the interstitial space and
tissue tension, are normally quite small and insignificant to
counteract the effects of plasma oncotic pressure and
capillary hydrostatic pressure respectively. However, in
some situations, the tissue factors in combination with other
mechanisms play a role in causation of oedema (Fig. 5.3,E).
These are as under:
i)
Elevation of oncotic pressure of interstitial fluid as occurs due
to increased vascular permeability and inadequate removal
of proteins by lymphatics.
ii) Lowered tissue tension as seen in loose subcutaneous tissues
of eyelids and external genitalia.
5.
INCREASED CAPILLARY PERMEABILITY. An intact
capillary endothelium is a semipermeable membrane which
permits the free flow of water and crystalloids but allows
minimal passage of plasma proteins normally. However,
when the capillary endothelium is injured by various
‘capillary poisons’ such as toxins and their products,
histamine, anoxia, venoms, certain drugs and chemicals, the
capillary permeability to plasma proteins is enhanced due
to development of gaps between the endothelial cells, leading
to leakage of plasma proteins into interstitial fluid. This, in
turn, causes reduced plasma oncotic pressure and elevated
oncotic pressure of interstitial fluid which consequently
produces oedema (Fig. 5.3,F).
The examples of oedema due to increased vascular
permeability are seen in the following conditions:
i)
Generalised oedema occurring in systemic infections,
poisonings, certain drugs and chemicals, anaphylactic
reactions and anoxia.
ii) Localised oedema. A few examples are as under:
Inflammatory oedema as seen in infections, allergic
reactions, insect-bite, irritant drugs and chemicals. It is
generally exudate in nature.
Angioneurotic oedema is an acute attack of localised
oedema occurring on the skin of face and trunk and may
involve lips, larynx, pharynx and lungs. It is possibly
neurogenic or allergic in origin.
6.
SODIUM AND WATER RETENTION. Before descri-
bing the mechanism of oedema by sodium and water
retention in extravascular compartment, it is essential to
recollect the normal regulatory mechanism of sodium and
water balance.
Natrium (Na) is the Latin term for sodium. Normally,
about 80% of sodium is reabsorbed by the proximal
convoluted tubule under the influence of either intrinsic renal
mechanism or extra-renal mechanism while retention of
water is affected by release of antidiuretic hormone (Fig. 5.4):
Intrinsic renal mechanism is activated in response to
sudden reduction in the effective arterial blood volume
(hypovolaemia) e.g. in severe haemorrhage. Hypovolaemia
stimulates the arterial baroreceptors present in the carotid

98
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
sinus and aortic arch which, in turn, send the sympathetic
outflow via the vasomotor centre in the brain. As a result of
this, renal ischaemia occurs which causes reduction in the
glomerular filtration rate, decreased excretion of sodium in
the urine and consequent retention of sodium.
Extra-renal mechanism involves the secretion of
aldosterone, a sodium retaining hormone, by the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system. Renin is an enzyme secreted
by the granular cells in the juxta-glomerular apparatus. Its
release is stimulated in response to low concentration of
sodium in the tubules. Its main action is stimulation of the
angiotensinogen which is α2-globulin or renin substrate
present in the plasma. On stimulation, angiotensin I, a
decapeptide, is formed in the plasma which is subsequently
converted into angiotensin II, an octapeptide, in the lungs
and kidneys by angiotension converting enzyme (ACE).
Angiotensin II stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete aldo-
sterone hormone. Aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption
in the renal tubules and sometimes causes a rise in the blood
pressure.
ADH mechanism. Retention of sodium leads to retention
of water secondarily under the influence of anti-diuretic
hormone (ADH) or vasopressin. This hormone is secreted
by the cells of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei in
the hypothalamus and is stored in the neurohypophysis
(posterior pituitary). The release of hormone is stimulated
by increased concentration of sodium in the plasma and
hypovolaemia. Large amounts of ADH produce highly
concentrated urine.
The possible factors responsible for causation of oedema
by excessive retention of sodium and water in the
extravascular compartment via stimulation of intrinsic renal
and extra-renal mechanisms as well as via release of ADH
are as under:
i) Reduced glomerular filtration rate in response to
hypovolaemia.
ii) Enhanced tubular reabsorption of sodium and
consequently its decreased renal excretion.
iii) Increased filtration factor i.e. increased filtration of plasma
from the glomerulus.

CHAPTER 5
Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics
iv) Decreased capillary hydrostatic pressure associated with
increased renal vascular resistance.
The examples of oedema by these mechanims are as
under:
i)
Oedema of cardiac disease e.g. in congestive cardiac failure.
ii) Ascites of liver disease e.g. in cirrhosis of liver.
iii) Oedema of renal disease e.g. in nephrotic syndrome, acute
glomerulonephritis.
PATHOGENESIS AND MORPHOLOGY OF
IMPORTANT TYPES OF OEDEMA
As observed from the pathogenesis of oedema just described,
more than one mechanism may be involved in many
examples of localised and generalised oedema. Some of the
important examples are described below.
Renal Oedema
Generalised oedema occurs in certain diseases of renal origin
such as in nephrotic syndrome, some types of
glomerulonephritis, and in renal failure due to acute tubular
injury.
1.
Oedema in nephrotic syndrome. Since there is persistent
and heavy proteinuria (albuminuria) in nephrotic syndrome,
there is hypoalbuminaemia causing decreased plasma
oncotic pressure resulting in severe generalised oedema
(nephrotic oedema). The hypoalbuminaemia causes fall in the
plasma volume activating renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
mechanism which results in retention of sodium and water,
thus setting in a vicious cycle which persists till the
albuminuria continues. Similar type of mechanism operates
in the pathogenesis of oedema in protein-losing enteropathy,
further confirming the role of protein loss in the causation of
oedema.
The nephrotic oedema is classically more severe and
marked and is present in the subcutaneous tissues as well as
in the visceral organs. The affected organ is enlarged and
heavy with tense capsule.
Microscopically, the oedema fluid separates the
connective tissue fibres of subcutaneous tissues.
Depending upon the protein content, the oedema fluid
may appear homogeneous, pale, eosinophilic, or may be
deeply eosinophilic and granular.
2.
Oedema in nephritic syndrome. Oedema occurs in
conditions with diffuse glomerular disease such as in acute
diffuse glomerulonephritis and rapidly progressive
glomerulonephritis (nephritic oedema). In contrast to nephrotic
oedema, nephritic oedema is not due to hypoproteinaemia
but is largely due to excessive reabsorption of sodium and
water in the renal tubules via renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
mechanism. The protein content of oedema fluid in
glomerulonephritis is quite low (less than 0.5 g/dl).
The nephritic oedema is usually mild as compared to
nephrotic oedema and begins in the loose tissues such as on
the face around eyes, ankles and genitalia. Oedema in these
conditions is usually not affected by gravity (unlike cardiac
oedema).
The salient differences between the nephrotic and
nephritic oedema are outlined in Table 5.2.
3.
Oedema in acute tubular injury. Acute tubular injury
following shock or toxic chemicals results in gross oedema
of the body. The damaged tubules lose their capacity for
selective reabsorption and concentration of the glomerular
filtrate resulting in increased reabsorption and oliguria.
Besides, there is excessive retention of water and electrolytes
and rise in blood urea.
Cardiac Oedema
Generalised oedema develops in right-sided and congestive
cardiac failure. Pathogenesis of cardiac oedema is explained
on the basis of the following hypotheses (Fig. 5.5):
1.
Reduced cardiac output causes hypovolaemia which
stimulates intrinsic-renal and extra-renal hormonal (renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone) mechanisms as well as ADH
secretion resulting in sodium and water retention and
consequent oedema.
2.
Due to heart failure, there is elevated central venous
pressure which is transmitted backward to the venous end
of the capillaries, raising the capillary hydrostatic pressure
and consequent transudation; this is known as back pressure
hypothesis.
3.
Chronic hypoxia may injure the capillary wall causing
increased capillary permeability and result in oedema; this
is called forward pressure hypothesis. However, this theory
lacks support since the oedema by this mechanism is exudate
whereas the cardiac oedema is typically transudate.
In left heart failure, the changes are, however, different.
There is venous congestion, particularly in the lungs, so that
pulmonary oedema develops rather than generalised oedema
(described below).
Cardiac oedema is influenced by gravity and is thus
characteristically dependent oedema i.e. in an ambulatory
patient it is on the lower extremities, while in a bed-ridden
patient oedema appears on the sacral and genital areas. The
accumulation of fluid may also occur in serous cavities.

Pulmonary Oedema
Acute pulmonary oedema is the most important form of local
oedema as it causes serious functional impairment but has
special features. It differs from oedema elsewhere in that the
fluid accumulation is not only in the tissue space but also in
the pulmonary alveoli.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The hydrostatic pressure in the
pulmonary capillaries is much lower (average 10 mmHg).
Normally the plasma oncotic pressure is adequate to prevent
the escape of fluid into the interstitial space and hence lungs
are normally free of oedema. Pulmonary oedema can result
from either the elevation of pulmonary hydrostatic pressure
or the increased capillary permeability (Fig. 5.6).
1.
Elevation in pulmonary hydrostatic pressure (Haemo-
dynamic oedema). In heart failure, there is increase in the
pressure in pulmonary veins which is transmitted to
pulmonary capillaries. This results in imbalance between

respiratory ill-effects. Commonly, the deleterious effects
begin to appear after an altitude of 2500 metres is reached.
These changes include appearance of oedema fluid in the
lungs, congestion and widespread minute haemorrhages.
These changes can cause death within a few days. The under-
lying mechanism appears to be anoxic damage to the
pulmonary vessels. However, if acclimatisation to high
altitude is allowed to take place, the individual develops
polycythaemia, raised pulmonary arterial pressure, increased
pulmonary ventilation and a rise in heart rate and increased
cardiac output.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Irrespective of the under-
lying mechanism in the pathogenesis of pulmonary
oedema, the fluid accumulates more in the basal regions
of lungs. The thickened interlobular septa along with their
dilated lymphatics may be seen in chest X-ray as linear
lines perpendicular to the pleura and are known as Kerley’s
lines.
Grossly, the lungs in pulmonary oedema are heavy, moist
and subcrepitant. Cut surface exudes frothy fluid (mixture
of air and fluid).
Microscopically, the alveolar capillaries are congested.
Initially, the excess fluid collects in the interstitial lung
spaces (interstitial oedema). Later, the fluid fills the
alveolar spaces (alveolar oedema). Oedema fluid in the
interstitium as well as the alveolar spaces appears as
eosinophilic, granular and pink proteinaceous material,
often admixed with some RBCs and macrophages
(Fig. 5.7). This may be seen as brightly eosinophilic pink
lines along the alveolar margin called hyaline membrane.
Long-standing pulmonary oedema is prone to get
infected by bacteria producing hypostatic pneumonia
which may be fatal.
Cerebral Oedema
Cerebral oedema or swelling of brain is the most threatening
example of oedema. The mechanism of fluid exchange in the
pulmonary hydrostatic pressure and the plasma oncotic
pressure so that excessive fluid moves out of pulmonary
capillaries into the interstitium of the lungs. Simultaneously,
the endothelium of the pulmonary capillaries develops
fenestrations permitting passage of plasma proteins and fluid
into the interstitium. The interstitial fluid so collected is
cleared by the lymphatics present around the bronchioles,
small muscular arteries and veins. As the capacity of the
lymphatics to drain the fluid is exceeded (about ten-fold
increase in fluid), the excess fluid starts accumulating in the
interstitium (interstitial oedema) i.e. in the loose tissues around
bronchioles, arteries and in the lobular septa. Next follows
the thickening of the alveolar walls because of the interstitial
oedema. Upto this stage, no significant impairment of
gaseous exchange occurs. However, prolonged elevation of
hydrostatic pressure and due to high pressure of interstitial
oedema, the alveolar lining cells break and the alveolar air
spaces are flooded with fluid (alveolar oedema) driving the air
out of alveolus, thus seriously hampering the lung function.
Examples of pulmonary oedema by this mechanism are
seen in left heart failure, mitral stenosis, pulmonary vein
obstruction, thyrotoxicosis, cardiac surgery, nephrotic
syndrome and obstruction to the lymphatic outflow by
tumour or inflammation.
2.
Increased vascular permeability (Irritant oedema). The
vascular endothelium as well as the alveolar epithelial cells
(alveolo-capillary membrane) may be damaged causing
increased vascular permeability so that excessive fluid and
plasma proteins leak out, initially into the interstitium and
subsequently into the alveoli.
This mechanism explains pulmonary oedema in examples
such as in fulminant pulmonary and extrapulmonary
infections, inhalation of toxic substances, aspiration, shock,
radiation injury, hypersensitivity to drugs or antisera,
uraemia and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Acute high altitude oedema. Individuals climbing to high
altitude suddenly without halts and without waiting for
acclimatisation to set in, suffer from serious circulatory and
Figure 5.7
Pulmonary oedema. The alveolar capillaries are congested. The alveolar spaces as well as interstitium contain eosinophilic,
granular, homogeneous and pink proteinaceous oedema fluid alongwith some RBCs and inflammatory cells.

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
brain differs from elsewhere in the body since there are no
draining lymphatics in the brain but instead, the function of
fluid-electrolyte exchange is performed by the blood-brain
barrier located at the endothelial cells of the capillaries.
Cerebral oedema can be of 3 types:
1.
VASOGENIC OEDEMA. This is the most common type
and corresponds to oedema elsewhere resulting from
increased filtration pressure or increased capillary perme-
ability. Vasogenic oedema is prominent around cerebral
contusions, infarcts, brain abscess and some tumours.
Grossly, the white matter is swollen, soft, with flattened
gyri and narrowed sulci. Sectioned surface is soft and
gelatinous.
Microscopically, there is separation of tissue elements by
the oedema fluid and swelling of astrocytes. The
perivascular (Virchow-Robin) space is widened and clear
halos are seen around the small blood vessels.
2.
CYTOTOXIC OEDEMA. In this type, the blood-brain
barrier is intact and the fluid accumulation is intracellular.
The underlying mechanism is disturbance in the cellular
osmoregulation as occurs in some metabolic derangements,
acute hypoxia and with some toxic chemicals.
Microscopically, the cells are swollen and vacuolated. In
some situations, both vasogenic as well as cytotoxic
cerebral oedema results e.g. in purulent meningitis.
3.
INTERSTITIAL OEDEMA. This type of cerebral oedema
occurs when the excessive fluid crosses the ependymal lining
of the ventricles and accumulates in the periventricular white
matter. This mechanism is responsible for oedema in non-
communicating hydrocephalus.
Hepatic Oedema
While this subject is discussed in detail in Chapter 21, briefly
the mechanisms involved in causation of oedema of the legs
and ascites in cirrhosis of the liver is as under:
i) There is hypoproteinaemia due to impaired synthesis of
proteins by the diseased liver.
ii) Due to portal hypertension, there is increased venous
pressure in the abdomen, and hence raised hydrostatic
pressure.
iii) Failure of inactivation of aldosterone in the diseased liver
and hence hyperaldosteronism.
iv) Secondary stimulation of renin-angiotensin mechanism
promoting sodium and water retention.
Nutritional Oedema
Oedema due to nutritional deficiency of proteins (kwashiorkor,
prolonged starvation, famine, fasting), vitamins (beri-beri due
to vitamin B1 deficiency) and chronic alcoholism occurs on
legs but sometimes may be more generalised. The main
contributing factors are hypoproteinaemia and sodium-water
retention related to metabolic abnormalities.
Myxoedema
Myxoedema from hypothyroidism (Chapter 27) is a form of
non-pitting oedema occurring on skin of face and other parts
of the body as also in the internal organs due to excessive
deposition of glycosaminoglycans in the interstitium.
Microscopically, it appears as basophilic mucopoly-
saccharides.
DEHYDRATION
Dehydration is a state of pure deprivation of water leading
to sodium retention and hence a state of hypernatraemia. In
other words, there is only loss of water but no loss of sodium.
Clinically, the patients present with intense thirst, mental
confusion, fever, and oliguria.
ETIOLOGY. Pure water deficiency is less common than salt
depletion but can occur in the following conditions:
1.
GI excretion:
i) Severe vomitings
ii) Diarrhoea
iii) Cholera
2. Renal excretion:
i) Acute renal failure in diuretic phase
ii) Extensive use of diuretics
iii) Endocrine diseases e.g. diabetes insipidus, Addison’s
disease
3. Loss of blood and plasma:
i)  Severe injuries, severe burns
ii)  During childbirth
4. Loss through skin:
i) Excessive perspiration
ii) Hyperthermia
5. Accumulation in third space:
i) Sudden development of ascites
ii) Acute intestinal obstruction with accumulation of fluid in
the bowel.
MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES. Although there are no
particular pathological changes in organs, except in
advanced cases when the organs are dark and shrunken.
However, there are haematological and biochemical
changes. There is haemoconcentration as seen by increased
PCV and raised haemoglobin. In late stage, there is rise in
blood urea and serum sodium. Renal shutdown and a state
of shock may develop.
OVERHYDRATION
Overhydration is increased extracellular fluid volume due
to pure water excess or water intoxication. Clinically, the
patients would present with disordered cerebral function e.g.
nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion and in severe cases
convulsions, coma, and even death.
ETIOLOGY. Overhydration is generally an induced
condition and is encountered in the following situations:
1.
Excessive unmonitored intravascular infusion:
i) Normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride)
ii) Ringer lactate
2. Renal retention of sodium and water:
i)  Congestive heart failure
ii)  Acute glomerulonephritis

103
CHAPTER 5
Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics
iii)  Cirrhosis
iv)  Cushing’s syndrome
v)  Chronic renal failure
MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES. Sudden weight gain is
a significant parameter of excess of fluid accumulation.
Haematological and biochemical changes include reduced
plasma electrolytes, lowered plasma proteins and reduced
PCV.
DISTURBANCES OF ELECTROLYTES
It may be recalled here once again that normally the
concentration of electrolytes within the cell and in the plasma
is different. Intracelluar compartment has higher
concentration of potassium, calcium, magnesium and
phosphate ions than the blood, while extracellular fluid
(including serum) has higher concentration of sodium,
chloride, and bicarbonate ions. In health, for electrolyte
homeostasis, the concentration of electrolytes in both these
compartments should be within normal limits. Normal serum
levels of electrolytes are maintained in the body by a careful
balance of 4 processes: their intake, absorption, distribution
and excretion. Disturbance in any of these processes in diverse
pathophysiologic states may cause electrolyte imbalance.
Among the important components in electrolyte
imbalance, abnormalities in serum levels of sodium (hypo-
and hypernatraemia), potassium (hypo- and hyperkalaemia),
calcium (hypo- and hypercalcaemia) and magnesium (hypo-
and hypermagnesaemia) are clinically more important. It is
beyond the scope of this book to delve into this subject in
detail. However, a few general principles on electrolyte
imbalances are as under:
1.
Electrolyte imbalance in a given case may result from one
or more conditions.
2.
Resultant abnormal serum level of more than one
electrolyte may be linked to each other. For example,
abnormality in serum levels of sodium and potassium;
calcium and phosphate.
3.
 Generally, the reflection of biochemical serum electrolyte
levels is in the form of metabolic syndrome and clinical
features rather than morphological findings in organs.
4.
Clinical manifestations of a particular electrolyte
imbalance are related to its pathophysiologic role in that organ
or tissue.
A list of important clinical conditions producing
abnormalities in sodium and potassium are given in
Table 5.3 while calcium and phosphate imbalances are
discussed in Chapter 28.
ACID-BASE IMBALANCE
(ABNORMALITIES IN pH OF BLOOD)
During metabolism of cells, carbon dioxide and metabolic
acids are produced. CO2 combines with water to form
carbonic acid. The role of bicarbonate buffering system in
the extracelluar compartment has already been stated above.
In order to have acid-base homeostasis to maintain blood
pH of 7.4, both carbonic acid and metabolic acids must be
excreted from the body via lungs (for CO2) and kidneys (for
metabolic acids). Thus, the pH of blood depends upon 2
principal factors:
TABLE 5.3:  Major Electrolyte Imbalances.
HYPONATRAEMIA
A. Gain of relatively more water than loss of sodium
i. Excessive use of diuretics
ii. Hypotonic irrigating fluid administration

B. Loss of relatively more water than salt
i. Diabetes insipidus
ii. Induced water deprivation (non-availability of water, total
fasting)
iii.  Replacement of salt without simultaneous water replacement
in conditions causing combined salt and water deficiency
HYPOKALAEMIA
A. Decreased potassium intake
i. Anorexia
ii.  IV infusions without potassium
iii. Fasting
iv. Diet low in potassium
B. Excessive potassium excretion
i. Loss from GI tract (e.g. vomitings, diarrhoea, laxatives)
ii. Loss from kidneys (e.g. excessive use of diuretics,
corticosteroid therapy, hyperaldosteronism, Cushing’s
syndrome)
iii. Loss through skin (e.g. profuse perspiration)
iv. Loss from abnormal routes (e.g. mucinous tumours, drainage
of fistula, gastric suction)
C. Excessive mobilisation from extracellular into intracellular
compartment
i. Excess insulin therapy
ii. Alkalosis
HYPERKALAEMIA
A. Excessive potassium intake
i. Excessive or rapid infusion containing potassium
ii. Large volume of transfusion of stored blood
B. Decreased potassium excretion

ii.  Adrenal cortical insufficiency (e.g. Addison’s disease)
iii. Drugs such as ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme)
inhibitors
iv. Renal tubular disorders
C. Excessive mobilisation from intracellular into extracellular
compartment
i. Muscle necrosis (e.g. in crush injuries, haemolysis)
ii. Diabetic acidosis
iii. Use of drugs such as beta-blockers, cytotoxic drugs
iv. Insufficient insulin

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
serum concentration of bicarbonate; and
partial pressure of CO2 that determines the concentration
of carbonic acid.
Accordingly, the disorders of the pH of the blood, termed
as acidosis (blood pH below 7.4) and alkalosis (blood pH
above 7.4), can be of 2 types:
1.
Alterations in the blood bicarbonate levels: These are
metabolic acidosis and alkalosis.
2.
Alteration in Pco2 (which depends upon the ventilatory
function of the lungs): These are respiratory acidosis and
alkalosis.
Thus, abnormalities in acid-base homeostasis produce
following 4 principal metabolic syndromes which have
diverse clinical manifestations due to pathophysiologic
derangements:
Metabolic Acidosis
A fall in the blood pH due to metabolic component is brought
about by fall of bicarbonate level and excess of H+ ions in
the blood. This occurs in the following situations:
Production of large amounts of lactic acid (lactic acido-
sis) e.g. in vigorous exercise, shock.
Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (diabetic ketoacidosis).
Starvation.
Chronic renal failure.
Therapeutic administration of ammonium chloride or
acetazolamide (diamox).
High blood levels of H+ ions in metabolic acidosis
stimulate the respiratory centre so that the breathing is deep
and rapid (air hunger or Kussmaul’s respiration). There is fall
in the plasma bicarbonate levels.
Metabolic Alkalosis
A rise in the blood pH due to rise in the bicarbonate levels of
plasma and loss of H+ ions is called metabolic alkalosis. This
is seen in the following conditions:
Severe and prolonged vomitings.
Administration of alkaline salts like sodium bicarbonate.
Hypokalaemia such as in Cushing’s syndrome, increased
secretion of aldosterone.
Clinically, metabolic alkalosis is characterised by
depression of respiration, depressed renal function with
uraemia and increased bicarbonate excretion in the urine.
The blood level of bicarbonate is elevated.
Respiratory Acidosis
A fall in the blood pH occurring due to raised Pco2 conse-
quent to underventilation of lungs (CO2 retention) causes
respiratory acidosis. This can occur in the following
circumstances:
Air obstruction as occurs in chronic bronchitis, emphy-
sema, asthma.
Restricted thoracic movement e.g. in pleural effusion,
ascites, pregnancy, kyphoscoliosis.
Impaired neuromuscular function e.g. in poliomyelitis,
polyneuritis.
Clinically, there is peripheral vasodilatation and raised
intracranial pressure. If there is severe CO2 retention, patients
may develop confusion, drowsiness and coma. The arterial
Pco2 level is raised.
Respiratory Alkalosis
A rise in the blood pH occurring due to lowered Pco2
consequent to hyperventilation of the lungs (excess removal
of CO2) is called respiratory alkalosis. This is encountered in
the following conditions:
Hysterical overbreathing
Working at high temperature
At high altitude
Meningitis, encephalitis
Salicylate intoxication
Clinically, the patients with respiratory alkalosis are
characterised by peripheral vasoconstriction and consequent
pallor, lightheadedness and tetany. The arterial Pco2 is
lowered.
HAEMODYNAMIC DERANGEMENTS
The principles of blood flow are called haemodynamics.
Normal circulatory function requires uninterrupted flow of
blood from the left ventricle to the farthest capillaries in the
body; return of blood from systemic capillary network into
the right ventricle; and from the right ventricle to the farthest
pulmonary capillaries and back to the left atrium (Fig. 5.8).
There are three essential requirements to maintain normal
blood flow and perfusion of tissues: normal anatomic
features, normal physiologic controls for blood flow, and
normal biochemical composition of the blood.
Derangements of blood flow or haemodynamic distur-
bances are considered under 2 broad headings:
I.
Disturbances in the volume of the circulating blood. These
include: hyperaemia and congestion, haemorrhage and
shock.
II. Circulatory disturbances of obstructive nature. These are:
thrombosis, embolism, ischaemia and infarction.

CHAPTER 5
Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics
DISTURBANCES IN THE VOLUME OF
CIRCULATING BLOOD
HYPERAEMIA AND CONGESTION
Hyperaemia and congestion are the terms used for localised
increase in the volume of blood within dilated vessels of an
organ or tissue; the increased volume from arterial and
arteriolar dilatation being referred to as hyperaemia or active
hyperaemia, whereas the impaired venous drainage is called
venous congestion or passive hyperaemia. If the condition
develops rapidly it is called acute, while more prolonged and
gradual response is known as chronic.
Active Hyperaemia
The dilatation of arteries, arterioles and capillaries is effected
either through sympathetic neurogenic mechanism or via the
release of vasoactive substances. The affected tissue or organ
is pink or red in appearance (erythema).
The examples of active hyperaemia are seen in the
following conditions:
Inflammation e.g. congested vessels in the walls of alveoli
in pneumonia
Blushing i.e. flushing of the skin of face in response to
emotions
Menopausal flush
Muscular exercise
High grade fever
Goitre
Arteriovenous malformations
Clinically, hyperaemia is characterised by redness and
raised temperature in the affected part.
Passive Hyperaemia (Venous Congestion)
The dilatation of veins and capillaries due to impaired venous
drainage results in passive hyperaemia or venous congestion,
commonly referred to as congestion. Congestion may be acute
or chronic, the latter being more common and called chronic
venous congestion (CVC). The affected tissue or organ is bluish
in colour due to accumulation of venous blood (cyanosis).
Obstruction to the venous outflow may be local or systemic.
Accordingly, venous congestion is of 2 types:
Local venous congestion results from obstruction to the
venous outflow from an organ or part of the body e.g. portal
venous obstruction in cirrhosis of the liver, outside pressure
on the vessel wall as occurs in tight bandage, plasters,
tumours, pregnancy, hernia etc, or intraluminal occlusion
by thrombosis.
Systemic (General) venous congestion is engorgement of
systemic veins e.g. in left-sided and right-sided heart failure
and diseases of the lungs which interfere with pulmonary
blood flow like pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema etc. Usually
the fluid accumulates upstream to the specific chamber of
the heart which is initially affected (Chapter 16). For
example, in left-sided heart failure (such as due to mechanical
overload in aortic stenosis, or due to weakened left
ventricular wall as in myocardial infarction) pulmonary
congestion results, whereas in right-sided heart failure (such
as due to pulmonary stenosis or pulmonary hypertension)
systemic venous congestion results. Fig. 5.9 illustrates the
mechanisms involved in passive or venous congestion of
different organs.
Figure 5.9
Schematic representation of mechanisms involved in chronic venous congestion (CVC) of different organs.

106
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
MORPHOLOGY OF CVC OF ORGANS
CVC Lung
Chronic venous congestion of the lung occurs in left heart
failure (Chapter 16), especially in rheumatic mitral stenosis
so that there is consequent rise in pulmonary venous
pressure.
Grossly, the lungs are heavy and firm in consistency. The
sectioned surface is dark The sectioned surface is rusty
brown in colour referred to as brown induration of the
lungs.
Histologically, the alveolar septa are widened due to the
presence of interstitial oedema as well as due to dilated
and congested capillaries. The septa are mildly thickened
due to slight increase in fibrous connective tissue. Rupture
of dilated and congested capillaries may result in minute
intra-alveolar haemorrhages. The breakdown of
erythrocytes liberates haemosiderin pigment which is
taken up by alveolar macrophages, so called heart failure
cells, seen in the alveolar lumina. The brown induration
observed on the cut surface of the lungs is due to the
pigmentation and fibrosis (Fig. 5.10).
CVC Liver
Chronic venous congestion of the liver occurs in right heart
failure and sometimes due to occlusion of inferior vena cava
and hepatic vein.
Grossly, the liver is enlarged and tender and the capsule
is tense. Cut surface shows characteristic nutmeg*
appearance due to red and yellow mottled appearance,
corresponding to congested centre of lobules and fatty
peripheral zone respectively (Fig. 5.11).
Figure 5.10
CVC lung. The alveolar septa are widened and thickened due to congestion, oedema and mild fibrosis. The alveolar lumina
contain heart failure cells (alveolar macrophages containing haemosiderin pigment).
Microscopically, the changes of congestion are more
marked in the centrilobular zone due to severe hypoxia
than in the peripheral zone. The central veins as well as
the adjacent sinusoids are distended and filled with blood.
The centrilobular hepatocytes undergo degenerative
changes, and eventually centrilobular haemorrhagic necrosis
may be seen. Long-standing cases may show fine
centrilobular fibrosis and regeneration of hepatocytes,
resulting in cardiac cirrhosis (Chapter 21). The peripheral
zone of the lobule is less severely affected by chronic
hypoxia and shows some fatty change in the hepatocytes
(Fig. 5.12).
CVC Spleen
Chronic venous congestion of the spleen occurs in right heart
failure and in portal hypertension from cirrhosis of liver.
Grossly, the spleen in early stage is slightly to moderately
enlarged (up to 250 g as compared to normal 150 g), while
in long-standing cases there is progressive enlargement
and may weigh up to 500 to 1000 g. The organ is deeply
congested, tense and cyanotic. Sectioned surface is gray
tan (Fig. 5.13).
Microscopically, the features are as under (Fig. 5.14):
i) Red pulp is enlarged due to congestion and marked
sinusoidal dilatation and here are areas of recent and old
haemorrhages. Sinusoids may get converted into
capillaries (capillarisation of sinusoids).
ii) There is hyperplasia of reticuloendothelial cells in the
red pulp of the spleen (splenic macrophages).
iii) There is fibrous thickening of the capsule and of the
trabeculae.
iv) Some of haemorrhages overlying fibrous tissue get
deposits of haemosiderin pigment and calcium salts; these

in India, used in cooking as spice for giving flavours.

CHAPTER 5
Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics
HAEMORRHAGE
Haemorrhage is the escape of blood from a blood vessel. The
bleeding may occur externally, or internally into the serous
cavities (e.g. haemothorax, haemoperitoneum, haemoperi-
cardium), or into a hollow viscus. Extravasation of blood into
the tissues with resultant swelling is known as haematoma.
Large extravasations of blood into the skin and mucous
membranes are called ecchymoses. Purpuras are small areas
of haemorrhages (upto 1 cm) into the skin and mucous
membrane, whereas petechiae are minute pinhead-sized
haemorrhages. Microscopic escape of erythrocytes into loose
tissues may occur following marked congestion and is known
as diapedesis.
ETIOLOGY. The blood loss may be large and sudden (acute),
or small repeated bleeds may occur over a period of time
(chronic). The various causes of haemorrhage are as under:
Figure 5.11
Nutmeg liver. The cut surface shows mottled
appearance—alternate pattern of dark congestion and pale fatty change.
Figure 5.12
CVC liver. The centrilobular zone shows marked degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes accompanied by haemorrhage while
the peripheral zone shows mild fatty change of liver cells.
organised structures are termed as Gamna-Gandy bodies
or siderofibrotic nodules.
v) Firmness of the spleen in advanced stage is seen more
commonly in hepatic cirrhosis (congestive splenomegaly)
and is the commonest cause of hypersplenism (Chapter
14).
CVC Kidney
Grossly, the kidneys are slightly enlarged and the medulla
is congested.
Microscopically, the changes are rather mild. The tubules
may show degenerative changes like cloudy swelling and
fatty change. The glomeruli may show mesangial
proliferation.

108
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
1.
Trauma to the vessel wall e.g. penetrating wound in the
heart or great vessels, during labour etc.
2.
Spontaneous haemorrhage e.g. rupture of an aneurysm,
septicaemia, bleeding diathesis (such as purpura), acute
leukaemias, pernicious anaemia, scurvy.
3.
Inflammatory lesions of the vessel wall e.g. bleeding from
chronic peptic ulcer, typhoid ulcers, blood vessels traversing
a tuberculous cavity in the lung, syphilitic involvement of
the aorta, polyarteritis nodosa.
4.
Neoplastic invasion e.g. haemorrhage following vascular
invasion in carcinoma of the tongue.
5.
Vascular diseases e.g. atherosclerosis.
6.
Elevated pressure within the vessels e.g. cerebral and retinal
haemorrhage in systemic hypertension, severe haemorrhage
from varicose veins due to high pressure in the veins of legs
or oesophagus.
EFFECTS. The effects of blood loss depend upon 3 main
factors:
the amount of blood loss;
the speed of blood loss; and
the site of haemorrhage.
The loss up to 20% of blood volume suddenly or slowly
generally has little clinical effects because of compensatory
mechanisms. A sudden loss of 33% of blood volume may
cause death, while loss of up to 50% of blood volume over a
period of 24 hours may not be necessarily fatal. However,
chronic blood loss generally produces iron deficiency
anaemia, whereas acute haemorrhage may lead to serious
immediate consequences such as hypovolaemic shock.
SHOCK
Definition
Shock is a life-threatening clinical syndrome of cardio-
vascular collapse characterised by:
an acute reduction of effective circulating blood volume
(hypotension); and
an inadequate perfusion of cells and tissues
(hypoperfusion).
If uncompensated, these mechanisms may lead to
impaired cellular metabolism and death.
Thus, by definition “true (or secondary) shock” is a
circulatory imbalance between oxygen supply and oxygen
requirements at the cellular level, and is also called as
circulatory shock.
The term “initial (or primary) shock” is used for transient
and usually a benign vasovagal attack resulting from sudden
reduction of venous return to the heart caused by neurogenic
vasodilatation and consequent peripheral pooling of blood
e.g. immediately following trauma, severe pain or emotional
overreaction such as due to fear, sorrow or surprise.
Clinically, patients of primary shock suffer from the attack
lasting for a few seconds or minutes and develop brief
unconsciousness, weakness, sinking sensation, pale and

clammy limbs, weak and rapid pulse, and low blood
pressure. Another type of shock which is not due to
circulatory derangement is anaphylactic shock from type 1
immunologic reaction (page 73).
In routine clinical practice, however, true shock is the
form which occurs due to haemodynamic derangements with
hypoperfusion of the cells; this is the type which is commonly
referred to as ‘shock’ if not specified.
Classification and Etiology
Although in a given clinical case, two or more factors may
be involved in causation of true shock, a simple etiologic
classification of shock syndrome divides it into following 3
major types and a few other variants (Table 5.4):
1. Hypovolaemic shock. This form of shock results from
inadequate circulatory blood volume by various etiologic
factors that may be either from the loss of red cell mass and
plasma from haemorrhage, or from the loss of plasma volume
alone.
2. Cardiogenic shock. Acute circulatory failure with sudden
fall in cardiac output from acute diseases of the heart without
actual reduction of blood volume (normovolaemia) results
in cardiogenic shock.
3. Septic (Toxaemic) shock. Severe bacterial infections or
septicaemia induce septic shock. It may be the result of Gram-
negative septicaemia (endotoxic shock) which is more
common, or Gram-positive septicaemia (exotoxic shock).
4. Other types. These include following types:
i) Traumatic shock. Shock resulting from trauma is initially
due to hypovolaemia, but even after haemorrhage has been
controlled, these patients continue to suffer loss of plasma
volume into the interstitium of injured tissue and hence is
considered separately in some descriptions.
ii) Neurogenic shock. Neurogenic shock results from causes of
interruption of sympathetic vasomotor supply.
iii) Hypoadrenal shock. Hypoadrenal shock occurs from
unknown adrenal insufficiency in which the patient fails to
respond normally to the stress of trauma, surgery or illness.
Pathogenesis
In general, all forms of shock involve following 3
derangements:
Reduced effective circulating blood volume.
Reduced supply of oxygen to the cells and tissues with
resultant anoxia.
Inflammatory mediators and toxins released from shock-
induced cellular injury.
These derangements initially set in compensatory
mechanisms (discussed below) but eventually a vicious cycle
of cell injury and severe cellular dysfunction lead to
breakdown of organ function (Fig. 5.15).
1.  Reduced effective circulating blood volume. It may result
by either of the following mechanisms:
i)
by actual loss of blood volume as occurs in hypovolae-
mic shock; or
ii) by decreased cardiac output without actual loss of blood
(normovolaemia) as occurs in cardiogenic shock and septic
shock.
2.
Impaired tissue oxygenation. Following reduction in the
effective circulating blood volume from either of the above
two mechanisms and from any of the etiologic agents, there
is decreased venous return to the heart resulting in decreased
cardiac output. This consequently causes reduced supply of
oxygen to the organs and tissues and hence tissue anoxia,
which sets in cellular injury.
3. Release of inflammatory mediators. In response to
cellular injury, innate immunity of the body gets activated
as a body defense mechanism and release inflammatory
mediators but eventually these agents themselves become
the cause of cell injury. Endotoxins in bacterial wall in septic
shock stimulate massive release of pro-inflammatory
mediators (cytokines) but a similar process of release of
these agents takes place in late stages of shock from other
causes. Several pro-inflammatory inflammatory media-
tors are released from monocytes-macrophages, other
leucocytes and other body cells, the most important being
the tumour necrosis factor- (TNF)-α and interleukin-1
(IL-1) cytokines (Fig. 5.16).

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
After these general comments on mechanisms in shock,
features specific to pathogenesis of three main forms of shock
are given below:
PATHOGENESIS OF HYPOVOLAEMIC SHOCK. Hypo-
volaemic shock occurs from inadequate circulating blood
volume due to various causes. The major effects of
hypovolaemic shock are due to decreased cardiac output and
low intracardiac pressure. The severity of clinical features
depends upon degree of blood volume lost, haemorrhagic
shock is divided into 4 types:
< 1000 ml: Compensated
1000-1500 ml: Mild
1500-2000 ml: Moderate
>2000 ml: Severe
Accordingly, clinical features are increased heart rate
(tachycardia), low blood pressure (hypotension), low urinary
output (oliguria to anuria) and alteration in mental state
(agitated to confused to lethargic).
PATHOGENESIS OF CARDIOGENIC SHOCK. Cardio-
genic shock results from a severe left ventricular dysfunction
from various causes. The resultant decreased cardiac output
has its effects in the form of decreased tissue perfusion and
movement of fluid from pulmonary vascular bed into
pulmonary interstitial space initially (interstitial pulmonary
oedema) and later into alveolar spaces (alveolar pulmonary
oedema).
PATHOGENESIS OF SEPTIC SHOCK. Septic shock results
most often from Gram-negative bacteria entering the body
from genitourinary tract, alimentary tract, respiratory tract
or skin, and less often from Gram-positive bacteria. In septic
shock, there is immune system activation and severe systemic
inflammatory response to infection as follows:
i) Activation of macrophage-monocytes. Lysis of Gram-
negative bacteria releases endotoxin, a lipopolysaccharide,
into circulation where it binds to lipopolysaccharide-binding
protein (LBP). The complex of LPS-LBP binds to CD14
molecule on the surface of the monocyte/macrophages which
are stimulated to elaborate cytokines, the most important
ones being TNF-α and IL-1. The effects of these cytokines
are as under:
a) By altering endothelial cell adhesiveness: This results in
recruitment of more neutrophils which liberate free radicals
that cause vascular injury.
b) Promoting nitric oxide synthase: This stimulates increased
synthesis of nitric oxide which is responsible for
vasodilatation and hypotension.
ii) Activation of other inflammatory responses. Microbial
infection activates other inflammatory cascades which have
profound effects in triggering septic shock. These are as
under:
a) Activation of complement pathway: End-products C5a and
C3a induce microemboli and endothelial damage.
b) Activation of mast cells: Histamine is released which
increases capillary permeability.
Figure 5.15
Pathogenesis of circulatory shock.

111
CHAPTER 5
Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics
c) Activation of coagulation system: Enhances development of
thrombi.
d) Activation of kinin system: Released bradykinin cause
vasodilatation and increased capillary permeability.
The net result of above mechanisms is vasodilatation and
increased vascular permeability in septic shock. Profound
peripheral vasodilatation and pooling of blood causes
hyperdynamic circulation in septic shock, in contrast to
hypovolaemic and cardiogenic shock. Increased vascular
permeability causes development of inflammatory oedema.
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is prone to
develop in septic shock due to endothelial cell injury by
toxins. Reduced blood flow produces hypotension,
inadequate perfusion of cells and tissues, finally leading to
organ dysfunction.
Pathophysiology (Stages of Shock)
Although deterioration of the circulation in shock is a
progressive and continuous phenomenon and compensatory
mechanisms become progressively less effective, historically
shock has been divided arbitrarily into 3 stages (Fig. 5.17):
1.
Compensated (non-progressive, initial, reversible) shock.
2.
Progressive decompensated shock.
3.
Irreversible decompensated shock.
COMPENSATED (NON-PROGRESSIVE, INITIAL,
REVERSIBLE) SHOCK. In the early stage of shock, an
attempt is made to maintain adequate cerebral and coro-
nary blood supply by redistribution of blood so that the
vital organs (brain and heart) are adequately perfused and
oxygenated. This is achieved by activation of various neuro-
hormonal mechanisms causing widespread vasoconstriction
and by fluid conservation by the kidney. If the condition that
caused the shock is adequately treated, the compensatory
mechanism may be able to bring about recovery and re-
establish the normal circulation; this is called compensated
or reversible shock. These compensatory mechanisms are
as under:
i)
Widespread vasoconstriction. In response to reduced
blood flow (hypotension) and tissue anoxia, the neural and
humoral factors (e.g. baroreceptors, chemoreceptors,
catecholamines, renin, and angiotensin-II) are activated. All
these bring about vasoconstriction, particularly in the vessels
of the skin and abdominal viscera. Widespread vasoconstric-
tion is a protective mechanism as it causes increased

Response of inflammatory mediators in shock.
Figure 5.17
Mechanisms and effects of three stages of shock.

112
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
peripheral resistance, increased heart rate (tachycardia) and
increased blood pressure. However, in septic shock, there is
initial vasodilatation followed by vasoconstriction. Besides,
in severe septic shock there is elevated level of thromboxane
A2 which is a potent vasoconstrictor and may augment the
cardiac output along with other sympathetic mechanisms.
Clinically cutaneous vasoconstriction is responsible for cool
and pale skin in initial stage of shock.
ii) Fluid conservation by the kidney. In order to compen-
sate the actual loss of blood volume in hypovolaemic shock,
the following factors may assist in restoring the blood volume
and improve venous return to the heart:
Release of aldosterone from hypoxic kidney by activation
of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanism.
Release of ADH due to decreased effective circulating
blood volume.
Reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) due to arteriolar
constriction.
Shifting of tissue fluids into the plasma due to lowered
capillary hydrostatic pressure (hypotension).
iii) Stimulation of adrenal medulla. In response to low
cardiac output, adrenal medulla is stimulated to release
excess of catecholamines (epinephrine and non-epinephrine)
which increase heart rate and try to increase cardiac output.
PROGRESSIVE DECOMPENSATED SHOCK. This is a
stage when the patient suffers from some other stress or risk
factors (e.g. pre-existing cardiovascular and lung disease)
besides persistence of the shock so that there is progressive
deterioration. The effects of progressive decompensated
shock due to tissue hypoperfusion are as under:
i) Pulmonary hypoperfusion. Decompensated shock
worsens pulmonary perfusion and increases vascular
permeability resulting in tachypnoea and adult respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS).
ii) Tissue ischaemia. Impaired tissue perfusion causes switch
from aerobic to anaerobic glycolysis resulting in metabolic
lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis lowers the tissue pH which in
turn makes the vasomotor response ineffective. This results
in vasodilatation and peripheral pooling of blood.
Clinically at this stage the patient develops confusion and
worsening of renal function.
IRREVERSIBLE DECOMPENSATED SHOCK. When the
shock is so severe that in spite of compensatory mechanisms
and despite therapy and control of etiologic agent which
caused the shock, no recovery takes place, it is called
decompensated or irreversible shock. Its effects due to
widespread cell injury include the following:
i) Progressive vasodilatation. During later stages of shock,
anoxia damages the capillary and venular wall and arteioles
become unresponsive to vasoconstrictors listed above and
begin to dilate. Vasodilatation results in peripheral pooling
of blood which further deteriorate the effective circulating
blood volume.
ii) Increased vascular permeability. Anoxic damage to
tissues releases inflammatory mediators which cause
increased vascular permeability. This results in escape of
fluid from circulation into the interstitial tissues thus
deteriorating effective circulating blood volume.
iii) Myocardial depressant factor (MDF). Progressive fall in
the blood pressure and persistently reduced blood flow to
myocardium causes coronary insufficiency and myocardial
ischaemia due to release of myocardial depressant factor
(MDF). This results in further depression of cardiac function,
reduced cardiac output and decreased blood flow.
iv) Worsening pulmonary hypoperfusion. Further
pulmonary hypoperfusion causes respiratory distress due
to pulmonary oedema, tachypnoea and adult respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS).
v) Anoxic damage to heart, kidney, brain. Progressive tissue
anoxia causes severe metabolic acidosis due to anaerobic
glycolysis. There is release of inflammatory cytokines and
other inflammatory mediators and generation of free radicals.
Since highly specialised cells of myocardium, proximal
tubular cells of the kidney, and neurons of the CNS are
dependent solely on aerobic respiration for ATP generation,
there is ischaemic cell death in these tissues.
vi) Hypercoagulability of blood. Tissue damage in shock
activates coagulation cascade with release of clot promoting
factor, thromboplastin and release of platelet aggregator,
ADP, which contributes to slowing of blood-stream and
vascular thrombosis. In this way, hypercoagulability of blood
with consequent microthrombi impair the blood flow and
cause further tissue necrosis.
Clinically, at this stage the patient has features of coma,
worsened heart function and progressive renal failure due
to acute tubular necrosis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES
Eventually, shock is characterised by multisystem failure.
The morphologic changes in shock are due to hypoxia
resulting in degeneration and necrosis in various organs.
The major organs affected are the brain, heart, lungs and
kidneys. Morphologic changes are also noted in the
adrenals, gastrointestinal tract, liver and other organs. The
predominant morphologic changes and their mechanisms
are shown in Fig. 5.17 and described below.
1. HYPOXIC ENCEPHALOPATHY. Cerebral ischaemia
in compensated shock may produce altered state of
consciousness. However, if the blood pressure falls below
50 mmHg as occurs in systemic hypotension in
prolonged shock and cardiac arrest, brain suffers from
serious ischaemic damage with loss of cortical functions,
coma, and a vegetative state.
Grossly, the area supplied by the most distal branches of
the cerebral arteries suffers from severe ischaemic necrosis
which is usually the border zone between the anterior and
middle cerebral arteries (Chapter 30).

113
CHAPTER 5
Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics
Microscopically, the changes are noticeable if ischaemia
is prolonged for 12 to 24 hours. Neurons, particularly
Purkinje cells, are more prone to develop the effects of
ischaemia. The cytoplasm of the affected neurons is
intensely eosinophilic and the nucleus is small pyknotic.
Dead and dying nerve cells are replaced by gliosis.
2. HEART IN SHOCK. Heart is more vulnerable to the
effects of hypoxia than any other organ. Heart is affected
in cardiogenic as well as in other forms of shock. There
are 2 types of morphologic changes in heart in all types of
shock:
i) Haemorrhages and necrosis. There may be small or large
ischaemic areas or infarcts, particularly located in the
subepicardial and subendocardial region.
ii)Zonal lesions. These are opaque transverse contraction
bands in the myocytes near the intercalated disc.
3. SHOCK LUNG. Lungs due to dual blood supply are
generally not affected by hypovolaemic shock but in septic
shock the morphologic changes in lungs are quite
prominent termed ‘shock lung’.
Grossly, the lungs are heavy and wet.
Microscopically, changes of adult respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) are seen (Chapter 17). Briefly, the
changes include congestion, interstitial and alveolar
oedema, interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate, alveolar hyaline
membranes, thickening and fibrosis of alveolar septa, and
fibrin and platelet thrombi in the pulmonary
microvasculature.
4. SHOCK KIDNEY. One of the important complications
of shock is irreversible renal injury, first noted in persons
who sustained crush injuries in building collapses in air
raids in World War II. The renal ischaemia following
systemic hypotension is considered responsible for renal
changes in shock. The end-result is generally anuria and
death.
Grossly, the kidneys are soft and swollen. Sectioned
surface shows blurred architectural markings.
Microscopically, the tubular lesions are seen at all levels
of nephron and are referred to as acute tubular necrosis
(ATN) which can occur following other causes besides
shock (Chapter 22). If extensive muscle injury or
intravascular haemolysis are also associated, peculiar
brown tubular casts are seen.
5. ADRENALS IN SHOCK. The adrenals show stress
response in shock. This includes release of aldosterone in
response to hypoxic kidney, release of glucocorticoids
from adrenal cortex and catecholamines like adrenaline
from adrenal medulla. In severe shock, acute adrenal
haemorrhagic necrosis may occur.
6. HAEMORRHAGIC GASTROENTEROPATHY. The
hypoperfusion of the alimentary tract in conditions such
as shock and cardiac failure may result in mucosal and
mural infarction called haemorrhagic gastroenteropathy
(Chapter 20). This type of non-occlusive ischaemic injury
of bowel must be distinguished from full-fledged
infarction in which case the deeper layers of gut (muscu-
laris and serosa) are also damaged. In shock due to burns,
acute stress ulcers of the stomach or duodenum may occur
and are known as Curling’s ulcers.
Grossly, the lesions are multifocal and widely distributed
throughout the bowel. The lesions are superficial ulcers,
reddish purple in colour. The adjoining bowel mucosa is
oedematous and haemorrhagic.
Microscopically, the involved surface of the bowel shows
dilated and congested vessels and haemorrhagic necrosis
of the mucosa and sometimes submucosa. Secondary
infection may supervene and condition may progress into
pseudomembranous enterocolitis.
7. LIVER IN SHOCK. Grossly, faint nutmeg appearance
is seen.
Microscopically, depending upon the time lapse between
injury and cell death, ischaemic shrinkage, hydropic
change, focal necrosis, or fatty change may be seen. Liver
function may be impaired.
8. OTHER ORGANS. Other organs such as lymph nodes,
spleen and pancreas may also show foci of necrosis in
shock. In addition, the patients who survive acute phase
of shock succumb to overwhelming infection due to
altered immune status and host defense mechanism.
Clinical Features and Complications
The classical features of decompensated shock are
characterised by depression of 4 vital processes:
Very low blood pressure
Subnormal temperature
Feeble and irregular pulse
Shallow and sighing respiration
In addition, the patients in shock have pale face, sunken
eyes, weakness, cold and clammy skin.
Life-threatening complications in shock are due to
hypoxic cell injury resulting in immuno-inflammatory
responses and activation of various cascades (clotting,
complement, kinin). These include the following*:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
3. Acute renal failure (ARF)
4. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)
With progression of the condition, the patient may develop
stupor, coma and death.
CIRCULATORY DISTURBANCES OF
OBSTRUCTIVE NATURE
THROMBOSIS
Definition and Effects
Thrombosis is the process of formation of solid mass in
circulation from the constituents of flowing blood; the mass
itself is called a thrombus. In contrast, a blood clot is the mass
of coagulated blood formed in vitro e.g. in a test tube.
*Major complications of shock can be remembered from acronym
ADAM: A = ARDS; D = DIC, A = ARF; M = MODS.

114
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
Haematoma is the extravascular accumulation of blood clot
e.g. into the tissues. Haemostatic plugs are the blood clots
formed in healthy individuals at the site of bleeding e.g. in
injury to the blood vessel. In other words, haemostatic plug
at the cut end of a blood vessel may be considered the
simplest form of thrombosis. Haemostatic plugs are useful
as they stop the escape of blood and plasma, whereas thrombi
developing in the unruptured cardiovascular system may
be life-threatening by causing one of the following harmful
effects:
1.
Ischaemic injury. Thrombi may decrease or stop the blood
supply to part of an organ or tissue and cause ischaemia
which may subsequently result in infarction.
2.
Thromboembolism. The thrombus or its part may get
dislodged and be carried along in the bloodstream as embolus
to lodge in a distant vessel.
Pathophysiology
Since the protective haemostatic plug formed as a result of
normal haemostasis is an example of thrombosis, it is
essential to describe thrombogenesis in relation to the normal
haemostatic mechanism.
Human beings possess inbuilt system by which the blood
remains in fluid state normally and guards against the
hazards of thrombosis and haemorrhage. However, injury
to the blood vessel initiates haemostatic repair mechanism
or thrombogenesis.
Virchow described three primary events which
predispose to thrombus formation (Virchow’s triad):
endothelial injury, altered blood flow, and hypercoagulability
of blood. To this are added the processes that follow these
primary events: activation of platelets and of clotting system
(Fig. 5.18). These events are discussed below:
1.
ENDOTHELIAL INJURY. The integrity of blood vessel
wall is important for maintaining normal blood flow. An
intact endothelium has the following functions:
i)
It protects the flowing blood from the thrombogenic
influence of subendothelium.
ii) It elaborates a few anti-thrombotic factors (thrombosis
inhibitory factors) e.g.
a) Heparin-like substance which accelerates the action of
antithrombin III and inactivates some other clotting
factors.
b) Thrombomodulin which converts thrombin into activator
of protein C, an anticoagulant.
c)
Inhibitors of platelet aggregation such as ADPase, PGI2
or prostacyclin.
d) Tissue plasminogen activator which accelerates the
fibrinolytic activity.
iii) It can release a few prothrombotic factors which have
procoagulant properties (thrombosis favouring factors) e.g.
a) Thromboplastin or tissue factor released from endothelial
cells.
b) von Willebrand factor that causes adherence of platelets
to the subendothelium.
c)
Platelet activating factor which is activator and
aggregator of platelets.
d) Inhibitor of plasminogen activator that suppresses
fibrinolysis.
Vascular injury exposes the subendothelial connective
tissue (e.g. collagen, elastin, fibronectin, laminin and
Figure 5.18
Sequence of events in thrombogenesis. A, Major factors
in pathophysiology of thrombus formation. B, Endothelial injury exposes
subendothelium, initiating adherence of platelets and activation of coagulation
system. C, Following platelet release reaction, ADP is released which causes
further aggregation of platelets. D, Activated coagulation system forms fibrin
strands in which are entangled some leucocytes and red cells and a tight
meshwork is formed called thrombus.

115
CHAPTER 5
Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics
glycosaminoglycans) which are thrombogenic and thus plays
important role in initiating haemostasis as well as
thrombosis. Injury to vessel wall also causes vasoconstriction
of small blood vessels briefly so as to reduce the blood loss.
Endothelial injury is of major significance in the formation
of arterial thrombi and thrombi of the heart, especially of
the left ventricle. A number of factors and conditions may
cause vascular injury and predispose to the formation of
thrombi. These are as under:
i)
Endocardial injury in myocardial infarction, myocarditis,
cardiac surgery, prosthetic valves.
ii) Ulcerated plaques in advanced atherosclerosis.
iii) Haemodynamic stress in hypertension.
iv) Arterial diseases.
v) Diabetes mellitus.
vi) Endogenous chemical agents such as hypercholes-
terolaemia, endotoxins.
vii) Exogenous chemical agents such as cigarette smoke.
2.
ROLE OF PLATELETS. Following endothelial cell injury,
platelets come to play a central role in normal haemostasis
as well as in thrombosis. The sequence of events is as under
(Fig. 5.19):
i)
Platelet adhesion. The platelets in circulation recognise
the site of endothelial injury and adhere to exposed sub-
endothelial collagen (primary aggregation); von Willebrand’s
factor is required for such adhesion between platelets and
collagen. Normal non-activated platelets have open
canalicular system with cytoplasmic organelles (granules,
mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum) dispersed throughout
the cytoplasm. During the early adhesion process, there is
dilatation of canalicular system with formation of pseudo-
pods and the cytoplasmic organelles shift to the centre of
the cell.
ii) Platelet release reaction. The activated platelets then
undergo release reaction by which the platelet granules are
released to the exterior. Two main types of platelet granules
are released:
a) Alpha granules containing fibrinogen, fibronectin, platelet-
derived growth factor, platelet factor 4 (an antiheparin) and
cationic proteins.
b) Dense bodies containing ADP (adenosine diphosphate),
ionic calcium, 5-HT (serotonin), histamine and epinephrine.
As a sequel to platelet activation and release reaction,
the phospholipid complex-platelet factor 3 gets activated
which plays important role in the intrinsic pathway of
coagulation.
iii) Platelet aggregation. Following release of ADP, a potent
platelet aggregating agent, aggregation of additional platelets
takes place (secondary aggregation). This results in formation
of temporary haemostatic plug. However, stable haemostatic
plug is formed by the action of fibrin, thrombin and
thromboxane A2.
3.
ROLE OF COAGULATION SYSTEM. Coagulation
mechanism is the conversion of the plasma fibrinogen into
solid mass of fibrin. The coagulation system is involved in
both haemostatic process and thrombus formation. Fig. 5.20
shows the schematic representation of the cascade of intrinsic
(blood) pathway, the extrinsic (tissue) pathway, and the
common pathway leading to formation of fibrin polymers.
i)
In the intrinsic pathway, contact with abnormal surface
leads to activation of factor XII and the sequential interactions
of factors XI, IX, VIII and finally factor X, alongwith calcium
ions (factor IV) and platelet factor 3.
ii) In the extrinsic pathway, tissue damage results in the
release of tissue factor or thromboplastin. Tissue factor on
interaction with factor VII activates factor X.
iii) The common pathway begins where both intrinsic and
extrinsic pathways converge to activate factor X which forms
a complex with factor Va and platelet factor 3, in the presence
of calcium ions. This complex activates prothrombin (factor
II) to thrombin (factor IIa) which, in turn, converts fibrinogen
to fibrin. Initial monomeric fibrin is polymerised to form
insoluble fibrin by activation of factor XIII.

116
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
Regulation of coagulation system. The blood is kept in fluid
state normally and coagulation system kept in check by
controlling mechanisms. These are as under:
a) Protease inhibitors. These act on coagulation factors so as
to oppose the formation of thrombin e.g. antithrombin III,
protein C, C1 inactivator, α1-antitrypsin, α2-macroglobulin.
b) Fibrinolytic system. Plasmin, a potent fibrinolytic enzyme,
is formed by the action of plasminogen activator on
plasminogen present in the normal plasma. Two types of
plasminogen activators (PA) are identified:
Tissue-type PA derived from endothelial cells and
leucocytes.
Urokinase-like PA present in the plasma.
Plasmin so formed acts on fibrin to destroy the clot and
produces fibrin split products (FSP).
4.
ALTERATION OF BLOOD FLOW. Turbulence means
unequal flow while stasis means slowing.
i)
Normally, there is axial flow of blood in which the most
rapidly-moving central stream consists of leucocytes and red
cells. The platelets are present in the slow-moving laminar
stream adjacent to the central stream while the peripheral
stream consists of most slow-moving cell-free plasma close
to endothelial layer (Fig. 5.21,A).
ii) Turbulence and stasis occur in thrombosis in which the
normal axial flow of blood is disturbed. When blood slows
down, the blood cells including platelets marginate to the
periphery and form a kind of pavement close to endothelium
(margination and pavementing) (Fig. 5.21,B). While stasis
allows a higher release of oxygen from the blood, turbulence
may actually injure the endothelium resulting in deposition
of platelets and fibrin. Formation of arterial and cardiac

Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics
thrombi is facilitated by turbulence in the blood flow, while
stasis initiates the venous thrombi even without evidence of
endothelial injury.
5.
HYPERCOAGULABILITY OF BLOOD. The occurrence
of thrombosis in some conditions such as in nephrotic
syndrome, advanced cancers, extensive trauma, burns and
during puerperium is explained on the basis of hypercoagul-
ability of blood. The effect of hypercoagulability on
thrombosis is favoured by advancing age, smoking, use of
oral contraceptives and obesity. Hypercoagulability may
occur by the following changes in the composition of blood:
i)
Increase in coagulation factors e.g. fibrinogen, prothrombin,
factor VIIa, VIIIa and Xa.
ii) Increase in platelet count and their adhesiveness.
iii) Decreased levels of coagulation inhibitors e.g. antithrombin
III, fibrin split products.
Predisposing Factors
A number of primary (genetic) and secondary (acquired)
factors favour thrombosis.
Primary (Genetic) factors:
i)
Deficiency of antithrombin
ii) Deficiency of protein C or S
iii) Defects in fibrinolysis
iv) Mutation in factor V
Secondary (acquired) factors:
a) Risk factors:

Advanced age
ii) Prolonged bed-rest
iii) Immobilisation
iv) Cigarette smoking
b) Clinical conditions predisposing to thrombosis:
i)
Heart diseases (e.g. myocardial infarction, CHF,
rheumatic mitral stenosis, cardiomyopathy)
ii)  Vascular diseases (e.g. atherosclerosis, aneurysms of the
aorta and other vessels, varicosities of leg veins)
iii) Hypercoagulable conditions (e.g. polycythaemia,
dehydration, nephrotic syndrome , disseminated cancers)
iv)  Shock
v) Tissue damage e.g. trauma, fractures, burns, surgery
vi) Late pregnancy and puerperium
vii) Certain drugs (e.g. anaesthetic agents, oral contra-
ceptives).
Morphologic Features
Thrombosis may occur in the heart, arteries, veins and the
capillaries. Beside the differences in mechanisms of thrombus
formation at these sites, the clinical effects of these are even
more different. Arterial thrombi produce ischaemia and
infarction, whereas cardiac and venous thrombi cause
embolism.
The general morphologic features of thrombi are as
under:
Grossly, thrombi may be of various shapes, sizes and
composition depending upon the site of origin. Arterial
thrombi tend to be white and mural while the venous
thrombi are red and occlusive. Mixed or laminated
thrombi are also common and consist of alternate white
and red layers called lines of Zahn. Red thrombi are soft,
red and gelatinous whereas white thrombi are firm and
pale.
Microscopically, the composition of thrombus is deter-
mined by the rate of flow of blood i.e. whether it is formed
in the rapid arterial and cardiac circulation, or in the slow
moving flow in veins. The lines of Zahn are formed by
alternate layers of light-staining aggregated platelets
admixed with fibrin meshwork and dark-staining layer
of red cells. Red (venous) thrombi have more abundant
red cells, leucocytes and platelets entrapped in fibrin
meshwork. Thus, red thrombi closely resemble blood clots
in vitro (Fig. 5.22).
Red thrombi (antemortem) have to be distinguished from
postmortem clots (Table 5.5).
Figure 5.22
Thrombus in an artery. The thrombus is adherent to the arterial wall and is seen occluding most of the lumen. It shows lines of
Zahn composed of granular-looking platelets and fibrin meshwork with entangled red cells and leucocytes.

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
Origin of Thrombi
Thrombi may arise from the heart, arteries, veins or in
microcirculation.
CARDIAC THROMBI. Thrombi may form in any of the
chambers of the heart and on the valve cusps. They are more
common in the atrial appendages, especially of the right
atrium, and on mitral and aortic valves called vegetations
which may be seen in infective endocarditis and non-bacterial
thrombotic endocarditis (Chapter 16). Cardiac thrombi are
mural (non-occlusive) as are the mural thrombi encountered
in the aorta in atherosclerosis and in aneurysmal dilatations.
Rarely, large round thrombus may form and obstruct the
mitral valve and is called ball-valve thrombus. Agonal thrombi
are formed shortly before death and may occur in either or
both the ventricles. They are composed mainly of fibrin.
ARTERIAL AND VENOUS THROMBI. The examples of
major forms of vascular thrombi are as under:
Arterial thrombi:
i) Aorta: aneurysms, arteritis.
ii) Coronary arteries: atherosclerosis.
iii) Mesenteric artery: atherosclerosis, arteritis.
iv) Arteries of limbs: atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus,
Buerger’s disease, Raynaud’s disease.
v) Renal artery: atherosclerosis, arteritis.
vi) Cerebral artery: atherosclerosis, vasculitis.
Venous thrombi:
i) Veins of lower limbs: deep veins of legs, varicose veins.
ii) Popliteal, femoral and iliac veins: postoperative stage,
postpartum.
iii) Pulmonary veins: CHF, pulmonary hypertension.
iv) Hepatic and portal vein: portal hypertension.
v) Superior vena cava: infections in head and neck.
vi) Inferior vena cava: extension of thrombus from hepatic vein.
vii) Mesenteric veins: volvulus, intestinal obstruction.
viii) Renal vein: renal amyloidosis.
Distinguishing features between thrombi formed in
rapidly-flowing arterial circulation and slow-moving venous
blood are given in Table 5.6.
CAPILLARY THROMBI. Minute thrombi composed mainly
of packed red cells are formed in the capillaries in acute
inflammatory lesions, vasculitis and in disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC).
Fate of Thrombus
The possible fate of thrombi can be as under (Fig. 5.23):
1.
RESOLUTION. Thrombus activates the fibrinolytic
system with consequent release of plasmin which may
dissolve the thrombus completely resulting in resolution.
Usually, lysis is complete in small venous thrombi while large
thrombi may not be dissolved. Fibrinolytic activity can be
accentuated by administration of thrombolytic substances
(e.g. urokinase, streptokinase), especially in the early stage
when fibrin is in monomeric form.
2.
ORGANISATION. If the thrombus is not removed, it
starts getting organised. Phagocytic cells (neutrophils and
macrophages) appear and begin to phagocytose fibrin and
cell debris. The proteolytic enzymes liberated by leucocytes
and endothelial cells start digesting coagulum. Capillaries
grow into the thrombus from the site of its attachment and
fibroblasts start invading the thrombus. Thus, fibrovascular
granulation tissue is formed which subsequently becomes
dense and less vascular and is covered over by endothelial

CHAPTER 5
Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics
cells. The thrombus in this way is excluded from the vascular
lumen and becomes part of vessel wall. The new vascular
channels in it may be able to re-establish the blood flow,
called recanalisation. The fibrosed thrombus may undergo
hyalinisation and calcification e.g. phleboliths in the pelvic
veins.
3.
PROPAGATION. The thrombus may enlarge in size due
to more and more deposition from the constituents of flowing
blood. In this way, it may ultimately cause obstruction of
some important vessel.
4.
THROMBOEMBOLISM. The thrombi in early stage and
infected thrombi are quite friable and may get detached from
the vessel wall. These are released in part or completely in
bloodstream as emboli which produce ill-effects at the site
of their lodgement (page 120).
Clinical Effects
These depend upon the site of thrombi, rapidity of formation,
and nature of thrombi.
1.
Cardiac thrombi. Large thrombi in the heart may cause
sudden death by mechanical obstruction of blood flow or
through thromboembolism to vital organs.
2.
Arterial thrombi. These cause ischaemic necrosis of the
deprived part (infarct) which may lead to gangrene. Sudden
death may occur following thrombosis of coronary artery.
3.
Venous thrombi (Phlebothrombosis). These may cause
following effects:
i)
Thromboembolism
ii) Oedema of area drained
iii) Poor wound healing
iv) Skin ulcer
v) Painful thrombosed veins (thrombophlebitis)
vi) Painful white leg (phlegmasia alba dolens) due to
ileofemoral venous thrombosis in postpartum cases
vii) Thrombophlebitis migrans in cancer.
4.
Capillary thrombi. Microthrombi in microcirculation
may give rise to disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC).
EMBOLISM
Definition and Types
Embolism is the process of partial or complete obstruction of
some part of the cardiovascular system by any mass carried
in the circulation; the transported intravascular mass
detached from its site of origin is called an embolus. Most
usual forms of emboli (90%) are thromboemboli i.e.
originating from thrombi or their parts detached from the
vessel wall.
Emboli may be of various types:
A. Depending upon the matter in the emboli:
i)
Solid e.g. detached thrombi (thromboemboli), athero-
matous material, tumour cell clumps, tissue fragments,
parasites, bacterial clumps, foreign bodies.
ii) Liquid e.g. fat globules, amniotic fluid, bone marrow.
iii) Gaseous e.g. air, other gases.
B. Depending upon whether infected or not:
i)
Bland, when sterile.
ii) Septic, when infected.
C. Depending upon the source of the emboli:
i)
Cardiac emboli from left side of the heart e.g. emboli
originating from atrium and atrial appendages, infarct in the
left ventricle, vegetations of endocarditis.
ii) Arterial emboli e.g. in systemic arteries in the brain, spleen,
kidney, intestine.
iii) Venous emboli e.g. in pulmonary arteries.
iv) Lymphatic emboli can also occur.
D. Depending upon the flow of blood, two special types
of emboli are mentioned:
i)
Paradoxical embolus. An embolus which is carried from
the venous side of circulation to the arterial side or vice versa
is called paradoxical or crossed embolus e.g. through
arteriovenous communication such as in patent foramen
ovale, septal defect of the heart, and arteriovenous shunts in
the lungs.
Figure 5.23
Fate of thrombus.

120
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
ii) Retrograde embolus. An embolus which travels against the
flow of blood is called retrograde embolus e.g. metastatic
deposits in the spine from carcinoma prostate. The spread
occurs by retrograde embolism through intraspinal veins
which carry tumour emboli from large thoracic and
abdominal veins due to increased pressure in body cavities
e.g. during coughing or straining.
Some of the important types of embolism are tabulated
in Table 5.7 and described below:
Thromboembolism
A detached thrombus or part of thrombus constitutes the
most common type of embolism. These may arise in the
arterial or venous circulation (Fig. 5.24):
Arterial (systemic) thromboembolism. Arterial emboli may
be derived from the following sources:
A. Causes within the heart (80-85%): These are mural
thrombi in the left atrium or left ventricle, vegetations on
the mitral or aortic valves, prosthetic heart valves and
cardiomyopathy.
B. Causes within the arteries: These include emboli develop-
ing in relation to atherosclerotic plaques, aortic aneurysms,
pulmonary veins and paradoxical arterial emboli from the
systemic venous circulation.
The effects of arterial emboli depend upon their size, site
of lodgement, and adequacy of collateral circulation. If the
vascular occlusion occurs, the following ill-effects may result:
i)
Infarction of the organ or its affected part e.g. ischaemic
necrosis in the lower limbs (70-75%), spleen, kidneys, brain,
intestine.
ii) Gangrene following infarction in the lower limbs if the
collateral circulation is inadequate.
iii) Arteritis and mycotic aneurysm formation from bacterial
endocarditis.
iv) Myocardial infarction may occur following coronary
embolism.
v) Sudden death may result from coronary embolism or
embolism in the middle cerebral artery.
Venous thromboembolism. Venous emboli may arise from
the following sources:
i)
Thrombi in the veins of the lower legs are the most
common cause of venous emboli.
ii) Thrombi in the pelvic veins.
iii) Thrombi in the veins of the upper limbs.
iv) Thrombosis in cavernous sinus of the brain.
v) Thrombi in the right side of heart.
The most significant effect of venous embolism is
obstruction of pulmonary arterial circulation leading to
pulmonary embolism described below.
Pulmonary Thromboembolism
DEFINITION. Pulmonary embolism is the most common
and fatal form of venous thromboembolism in which there
is occlusion of pulmonary arterial tree by thromboemboli.
Pulmonary thrombosis as such is uncommon and may occur
in pulmonary atherosclerosis and pulmonary hypertension.
Differentiation of pulmonary thrombosis from pulmonary
thromboembolism is tabulated in Table 5.8.
ETIOLOGY. Pulmonary emboli are more common in
hospitalised or bed-ridden patients, though they can occur
in ambulatory patients as well. The causes are as follows:
i)
Thrombi originating from large veins of lower legs (such
as popliteal, femoral and iliac) are the cause in 95% of
pulmonary emboli.
ii) Less common sources include thrombi in varicosities of
superficial veins of the legs, and pelvic veins such as peri-
prostatic, periovarian, uterine and broad ligament veins.
PATHOGENESIS. Detachment of thrombi from any of the
above-mentioned sites produces a thrombo-embolus that
flows through venous drainage into the larger veins draining
into right side of the heart.
If the thrombus is large, it is impacted at the bifurcation
of the main pulmonary artery (saddle embolus), or may be
found in the right ventricle or its outflow tract.
More commonly, there are multiple emboli, or a large
embolus may be fragmented into many smaller emboli which

CHAPTER 5
Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics
are then impacted in a number of vessels, particularly
affecting the lower lobes of lungs.
Rarely, paradoxical embolism may occur by passage of an
embolus from right heart into the left heart through atrial or
ventricular septal defect. In this way, pulmonary emboli may
reach systemic circulation.
CONSEQUENCES OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM.
Pulmonary embolism occurs more commonly as a compli-
cation in patients of acute or chronic debilitating diseases
who are immobilised for a long duration. Women in their
reproductive period are at higher risk such as in late
pregnancy, following delivery and with use of contraceptive
pills. The effects of pulmonary embolism depend mainly on
the size of the occluded vessel, the number of emboli, and
on the cardiovascular status of the patient. The following
consequences can result (Fig. 5.25):
i)
Sudden death. Massive pulmonary embolism results in
instantaneous death, without occurrence of chest pain or
dyspnoea. However, if the death is somewhat delayed, the
clinical features resemble myocardial infarction i.e. severe
chest pain, dyspnoea and shock.
ii) Acute cor pulmonale. Numerous small emboli may
obstruct most of the pulmonary circulation resulting in acute
right heart failure. Another mechanism is by release of
vasoconstrictor substances from platelets or by reflex
vasoconstriction of pulmonary vessels.
iii) Pulmonary infarction. Obstruction of relatively small-
sized pulmonary arterial branches may result in pulmonary
infarction (page 127). The clinical features include chest pain
due to fibrinous pleuritis, haemoptysis and dyspnoea due
to reduced functioning pulmonary parenchyma.
iv) Pulmonary haemorrhage. Obstruction of terminal
branches (endarteries) leads to central pulmonary
haemorrhage. The clinical features are haemoptysis,
dyspnoea, and less commonly, chest pain due to central
location of pulmonary haemorrhage. Sometimes, there may
be concomitant pulmonary infarction.
v) Resolution. Vast majority of small pulmonary emboli
(60-80%) are resolved by fibrinolytic activity. These patients
are clinically silent owing to bronchial circulation so that lung
parenchyma is adequately perfused.
vi) Pulmonary hypertension, chronic cor pulmonale and
pulmonary arteriosclerosis. These are the sequelae of
multiple small thromboemboli undergoing healing rather
than resolution.
Systemic Embolism
This is the type of arterial embolism that originates comm-
only from thrombi in the diseased heart, especially in the
left ventricle. These diseases of heart include myocardial
infraction, cardiomyopathy, RHD, congenital heart disease,
infective endocarditis, and prosthetic cardiac valves. These
arterial emboli invariably cause infarction at the sites of
lodgement which include, in descending order of frequency,
lower extremity, brain, and internal visceral organs (spleen,
kidneys, intestines). Thus, the effects and sites of arterial emboli
are in striking contrast to venous emboli which are often lodged
in the lungs.
Fat Embolism
Obstruction of arterioles and capillaries by fat globules
constitutes fat embolism. If the obstruction in the circulation
is by fragments of adipose tissue, it is called fat-tissue
embolism.
ETIOLOGY. Following are the important causes of fat
embolism:
i)
Traumatic causes:
Trauma to bones is the most common cause of fat embolism
e.g. in fractures of long bones leading to passage of fatty

General Pathology and Basic Techniques
marrow in circulation, concussions of bones, after
orthopaedic surgical procedures etc.
Trauma to soft tissue e.g. laceration of adipose tissue and
in puerperium due to injury to pelvic fatty tissue.
ii) Non-traumatic causes:
Extensive burns
Diabetes mellitus
Fatty liver
Pancreatitis
Sickle cell anaemia
Decompression sickness
Inflammation of bones and soft tissues
Extrinsic fat or oils introduced into the body.
PATHOGENESIS. The following mechanisms are proposed
to explain the pathogenesis of fat embolism. These may be
acting singly or in combination.
i)
Mechanical theory. Mobilisation of fluid fat may occur
following trauma to the bone or soft tissues. The fat globules
released from the injured area may enter venous circulation
and finally most of the fat is arrested in the small vessels in
the lungs. Some of the fat globules may further pass through
into the systemic circulation to lodge in other organs.
ii) Emulsion instability theory. This theory explains the
pathogenesis of fat embolism in non-traumatic cases.
According to this theory, fat emboli are formed by aggrega-
tion of plasma lipids (chylomicrons and fatty acids) due to
disturbance in natural emulsification of fat.
iii) Intravascular coagulation theory. In stress, release of
some factor activates disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC) and aggregation of fat emboli.
iv) Toxic injury theory. According to this theory, the small
blood vessels of lungs are chemically injured by high plasma
levels of free fatty acid, resulting in increased vascular
permeability and consequent pulmonary oedema.
CONSEQUENCES OF FAT EMBOLISM. The effects of fat
embolism depend upon the size and quantity of fat globules,
and whether or not the emboli pass through the lungs into
the systemic circulation.
i)
Pulmonary fat embolism. In patients dying after frac-
tures of bones, presence of numerous fat emboli in the
capillaries of the lung is a frequent autopsy finding because
the small fat globules are not likely to appreciably obstruct
the vast pulmonary vascular bed. However, widespread
obstruction of pulmonary circulation due to extensive
pulmonary embolism can occur and result in sudden death.
Microscopically, the lungs show hyperaemia, oedema,
petechial haemorrhages and changes of adult respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS). Pulmonary infarction is
usually not a feature of fat embolism because of the small
size of globules. In routine stains, the fat globules in the
pulmonary arteries, capillaries and alveolar spaces appear
as vacuoles. Frozen section is essential for confirmation
of globules by fat stains such as Sudan dyes (Sudan black,
Sudan III and IV), oil red O and osmic acid.
ii) Systemic fat embolism. Some of the fat globules may
pass through the pulmonary circulation such as via patent
foramen ovale, arteriovenous shunts in the lungs and
vertebral venous plexuses, and get lodged in the capillaries
of organs like the brain, kidney, skin etc.
Brain. The pathologic findings in the brain are
petechial haemorrhages on the leptomeninges and minute
haemorrhages in the parenchyma.
Microscopically, microinfarct of brain, oedema and
haemorrhages are seen. The CNS manifestations include
delirium, convulsions, stupor, coma and sudden death.
Kidney. Renal fat embolism present in the glomerular
capillaries, may cause decreased glomerular filtration.
Other effects include tubular damage and renal
insufficiency.
Other organs. Besides the brain and kidneys, other
findings in systemic fat embolism are petechiae in the skin,
conjunctivae, serosal surfaces, fat globules in the urine
and sputum.
Gas Embolism
Air, nitrogen and other gases can produce bubbles within
the circulation and obstruct the blood vessels causing damage
to tissue. Two main forms of gas embolism—air embolism
and decompression sickness are described below.
Air Embolism
Air embolism occurs when air is introduced into venous or
arterial circulation.
VENOUS AIR EMBOLISM. Air may be sucked into
systemic veins under the following circumstances:
i)
Operations on head and neck, and trauma. The
accidental opening of a major vein of the neck like jugular,
or neck wounds involving the major neck veins, may allow
air to be drawn into venous circulation.
ii) Obstetrical operations and trauma. During childbirth by
normal vaginal delivery, caesarean section, abortions and
other procedures, fatal air embolism may result from the
entrance of air into the opened-up uterine venous sinuses
and endometrial veins.
iii) Intravenous infusion of blood and fluid. Air embolism
may occur during intravenous blood or fluid infusions if only
positive pressure is employed.
iv) Angiography. During angiographic procedures, air may
be entrapped into a large vein causing air embolism.
The effects of venous air embolism depend upon the
following factors:
i)
Amount of air introduced into the circulation. The volume
of air necessary to cause death is variable but usually 100-
150 ml of air entry is considered fatal.
ii) Rapidity of entry of a smaller volume of air is important
determinant of a fatal outcome.
iii) Position of the patient during or soon after entry of air is
another factor. The air bubbles may ascend into the superior
vena cava if the position of head is higher than the trunk
(e.g. in upright position) and reach the brain.

123
CHAPTER 5
Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics
iv) General condition of the patient e.g. in severely ill patients,
as little as 40 ml of air may have serious results.
The mechanism of death is by entrapment of air emboli
in the pulmonary arterial trunk in the right heart. If bubbles
of air in the form of froth pass further out into pulmonary
arterioles, they cause widespread vascular occlusions. If
death from pulmonary air embolism is suspected, the heart
and pulmonary artery should be opened in situ under water
so that escaping froth or foam formed by mixture of air and
blood can be detected.
ARTERIAL AIR EMBOLISM. Entry of air into pulmonary
vein or its tributaries may occur in the following conditions:
i)
Cardiothoracic surgery and trauma. Arterial air
embolism may occur following thoracic operations,
thoracocentesis, rupture of the lung, penetrating wounds of
the lung, artificial pneumothorax etc.
ii) Paradoxical air embolism. This may occur due to passage
of venous air emboli to the arterial side of circulation through
a patent foramen ovale or via pulmonary arteriovenous
shunts.
iii) Arteriography. During arteriographic procedures, air
embolism may occur.
The effects of arterial air embolism are in the form of
certain characteristic features:
i)
Marble skin due to blockage of cutaneous vessels.
ii) Air bubbles in the retinal vessels seen ophthalmos-
copically.
iii) Pallor of the tongue due to occlusion of a branch of lingual
artery.
iv) Coronary or cerebral arterial air embolism may cause
sudden death by much smaller amounts of air than in the
venous air embolism.
Decompression Sickness
This is a specialised form of gas embolism known by various
names such as caisson’s disease, divers’ palsy or
aeroembolism.
PATHOGENESIS. Decompression sickness is produced
when the individual decompresses suddenly, either from
high atmospheric pressure to normal level, or from normal
pressure to low atmospheric pressure.
In divers, workers in caissons (diving-bells), offshore
drilling and tunnels, who descend to high atmospheric
pressure, increased amount of atmospheric gases (mainly
nitrogen; others are O2, CO2) are dissolved in blood and tissue
fluids. When such an individual ascends too rapidly i.e.
comes to normal level suddenly from high atmospheric
pressure, the gases come out of the solution as minute
bubbles, particularly in fatty tissues which have affinity for
nitrogen. These bubbles may coalesce together to form large
emboli.
In aeroembolism, seen in those who ascend to high
altitudes or air flight in unpressurised cabins, the individuals
are exposed to sudden decompression from low atmospheric
pressure to normal levels. This results in similar effects as in
divers and workers in caissons.
EFFECTS. The effects of decompression sickness depend
upon the following:
Depth or altitude reached
Duration of exposure to altered pressure
Rate of ascent or descent
General condition of the individual
Pathologic changes are more pronounced in sudden
decompression from high pressure to normal levels than in
those who decompress from low pressure to normal levels.
The changes are more serious in obese persons as nitrogen
gas is more soluble in fat than in body fluids.
Clinical effects of decompression sickness are of 2 types—
acute and chronic.
Acute form occurs due to acute obstruction of small blood
vessels in the vicinity of joints and skeletal muscles. The
condition is clinically characterised by the following:
i)
‘The bends’, as the patient doubles up in bed due to acute
pain in joints, ligaments and tendons.
ii) ‘The chokes’ occur due to accumulation of bubbles in the
lungs, resulting in acute respiratory distress.
iii) Cerebral effects may manifest in the form of vertigo, coma,
and sometimes death.
Chronic form is due to foci of ischaemic necrosis
throughout body, especially the skeletal system. Ischaemic
necrosis may be due to embolism per se, but other factors
such as platelet activation, intravascular coagulation and
hypoxia might contribute. The features of chronic form are
as under:
i)
Avascular necrosis of bones e.g. head of femur, tibia,
humerus.
ii) Neurological symptoms may occur due to ischaemic
necrosis in the central nervous system. These include
paraesthesias and paraplegia.
iii) Lung involvement in the form of haemorrhage, oedema,
emphysema and atelactasis may be seen. These result in
dyspnoea, nonproductive cough and chest pain.
iv) Skin manifestations include itching, patchy erythema,
cyanosis and oedema.
v) Other organs like parenchymal cells of the liver and
pancreas may show lipid vacuoles.
Amniotic Fluid Embolism
This is the most serious, unpredictable and unpreventible
cause of maternal mortality. During labour and in the
immediate postpartum period, the contents of amniotic fluid
may enter the uterine veins and reach right side of the heart
resulting in fatal complications. The amniotic fluid
components which may be found in uterine veins, pulmonary
artery and vessels of other organs are: epithelial squames,
vernix caseosa, lanugo hair, bile from meconium, and mucus.
The mechanism by which these amniotic fluid contents enter
the maternal circulation is not clear. Possibly, they gain entry

124
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
either through tears in the myometrium and endocervix, or
the amniotic fluid is forced into uterine sinusoids by vigorous
uterine contractions.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Notable changes are seen
in the lungs such as haemorrhages, congestion, oedema
and changes of ARDS, and dilatation of right side of the
heart. These changes are associated with identifiable
amniotic fluid contents within the pulmonary micro-
circulation.
The clinical syndrome of amniotic fluid embolism is
characterised by the following features:
Sudden respiratory distress and dyspnoea
Deep cyanosis
Cardiovascular shock
Convulsions
Coma
nexpected death
The cause of death may not be obvious but can occur as a
result of the following mechanisms:
i)
Mechanical blockage of the pulmonary circulation in
extensive embolism.
ii) Anaphylactoid reaction to amniotic fluid components.
iii) Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to
liberation of thromboplastin by amniotic fluid.
iv) Haemorrhagic manifestations due to thrombocytopenia
and afibrinogenaemia.
Atheroembolism
Atheromatous plaques, especially from aorta, may get eroded
to form atherosclerotic emboli which are then lodged in
medium-sized and small arteries. These emboli consist of
cholesterol crystals, hyaline debris and calcified material, and
may evoke foreign body reaction at the site of lodgement.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Pathologic changes and
their effects in atheroembolism are as under:
i) Ischaemia, atrophy and necrosis of tissue distal to the
occluded vessel.
ii) Infarcts in the organs affected such as the kidneys,
spleen, brain and heart.
iii) Gangrene in the lower limbs.
iv) Hypertension, if widespread renal vascular lesions are
present.
Tumour Embolism
Malignant tumour cells invade the local blood vessels and
may form tumour emboli to be lodged elsewhere, producing
metastatic tumour deposits. Notable examples are clear cell
carcinoma of kidney, carcinoma of the lung, malignant
melanoma etc (Chapter 8).
Miscellaneous Emboli
Various other endogenous and exogenous substances may
act as emboli. These are:
i)
Fragments of tissue
ii) Placental fragments
iii) Red cell aggregates (sludging)
iv) Bacteria
v) Parasites
vi) Barium emboli following enema
vii) Foreign bodies e.g. needles, talc, sutures, bullets, catheters
etc.
ISCHAEMIA
DEFINITION. Ischaemia is defined as deficient blood supply
to part of a tissue. The cessation of blood supply may be
complete (complete ischaemia) or partial (partial ischaemia).
The adverse effects of ischaemia may result from 3 ways:
1.
Hypoxia due to deprivation of oxygen to tissues; this is
the most important and common cause. It may be of 4 types:
i) Hypoxic hypoxia : due to low oxygen in arterial blood.
ii) Anaemic hypoxia: due to low level of haemoglobin in blood.
iii) Stagnant hypoxia: due to inadequate blood supply.
iv) Histotoxic hypoxia: low oxygen uptake due to cellular
toxicity.
2.
Malnourishment of cells due to inadequate supply of
nutrients to the tissue (i.e. glucose, amino acids); this is less
important.
3.
Inadequate clearance of metabolites which results in
accumulation of metabolic waste-products in the affected
tissue; this is relevant in some conditions such as muscleache
after ischaemia from heavy exercise.
ETIOLOGY. A number of causes may produce ischaemia.
These causes are discussed below with regard to different
levels of blood vessels:
1.
Causes in the heart. Inadequate cardiac output resulting
from heart block, ventricular arrest and fibrillation from
various causes may cause hypoxic injury to the brain.
i)
If the arrest continues for 15 seconds, consciousness is lost.
ii) If the condition lasts for more than 4 minutes, irreversible
ischaemic damage to the brain occurs.
iii) If it is prolonged for more than 8 minutes, death is
inevitable.
2.
Causes in the arteries. The commonest and most impor-
tant causes of ischaemia are due to obstruction in arterial
blood supply. These are as under:
i)
Luminal occlusion of artery:
a) Thrombosis
b) Embolism
ii) Causes in the arterial walls:
a) Vasospasm (e.g. in Raynaud’s disease)
b) Hypothermia, ergotism
c)
Arteriosclerosis
d) Polyarteritis nodosa
e) Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger’s disease)
f)
Severed vessel wall
iii) Outside pressure on an artery:
a) Ligature
b) Tourniquet
c)
Tight plaster, bandages
d) Torsion.

125
CHAPTER 5
Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics
3.
Causes in the veins. Blockage of venous drainage may
lead to engorgement and obstruction to arterial blood supply
resulting in ischaemia. The examples include the following:
i)
Luminal occlusion of vein:
a) Thrombosis of mesenteric veins
b) Cavernous sinus thrombosis
ii) Causes in the vessel wall of vein:
a) Varicose veins of the legs
iii) Outside pressure on vein:
a)  Strangulated hernia
b)  Intussusception
c) Volvulus
4.
Causes in the microcirculation. Ischaemia may result
from occlusion of arterioles, capillaries and venules. The
causes are as under:
i)
Luminal occlusion in microvasculature:
a) By red cells e.g. in sickle cell anaemia, red cells parasitised
by malaria, acquired haemolytic anaemia, sludging of the
blood.
b)  By white cells e.g. in chronic myeloid leukaemia
c)  By fibrin e.g. defibrination syndrome
d)  By precipitated cryoglobulins
e)  By fat embolism
f)  In decompression sickness.
ii) Causes in the microvasculature wall:
a)  Vasculitis e.g. in polyarteritis nodosa, Henoch-Schönlein
purpura, Arthus reaction, septicaemia.
b)  Frost-bite injuring the wall of small blood vessels.
iii) Outside pressure on microvasculature:
a)  Bedsores.
FACTORS DETERMINING SEVERITY OF ISCHAEMIC
INJURY. The extent of damage produced by ischaemia due
to occlusion of arterial or venous blood vessels depends upon
a number of factors. These are as under:
1.
Anatomic pattern. The extent of injury by ischaemia
depends upon the anatomic pattern of arterial blood supply
of the organ or tissue affected. There are 4 different patterns
of arterial blood supply:
i)
Single arterial supply without anastomosis. Some organs
receive blood supply from arteries which do not have
significant anastomosis and are thus functional end-arteries.
Occlusion of such vessels invariably results in ischaemic
necrosis. For example:
Central artery of the retina
Interlobular arteries of the kidneys.
ii) Single arterial supply with rich anastomosis. Arterial supply
to some organs has rich interarterial anastomoses so that
blockage of one vessel can re-establish blood supply
bypassing the blocked arterial branch, and hence the
infarction is less common in such circumstances. For
example:
Superior mesenteric artery supplying blood to the small
intestine.
Inferior mesenteric artery supplying blood to distal colon.
Arterial supply to the stomach by 3 separate vessels
derived from coeliac axis.
Interarterial anastomoses in the 3 main trunks of the
coronary arterial system.
iii) Parallel arterial supply. Blood supply to some organs and
tissues is such that the vitality of the tissue is maintained by
alternative blood supply in case of occlusion of one. For
example:
Blood supply to the brain in the region of circle of Willis.
Arterial supply to forearm by radial and ulnar arteries.
iv) Double blood supply. The effect of occlusion of one set of
vessels is modified if an organ has dual blood supply. For
example:
Lungs are perfused by bronchial circulation as well as
by pulmonary arterial branches.
Liver is supplied by both portal circulation and hepatic
arterial flow.
However, collateral circulation is of little value if the
vessels are severely affected with spasm, atheroma or any
other such condition.
2.
General and cardiovascular status. The general status
of an individual as regards cardiovascular function is an
important determinant to assess the effect of ischaemia. Some
of the factors which render the tissues more vulnerable to
the effects of ischaemia are as under:
i)
Anaemias (sickle cell anaemia, in particular)
ii) Lowered oxygenation of blood (hypoxaemia)
iii) Senility with marked coronary atherosclerosis
iv) Cardiac failure
v) Blood loss
vi) Shock.
3.
Type of tissue affected. The vulnerability of tissue of the
body to the effect of ischaemia is variable. The mesenchymal
tissues are quite resistant to the effect of ischaemia as
compared to parenchymal cells of the organs. The following
tissues are more vulnerable to ischaemia:
i)
Brain (cerebral cortical neurons, in particular).
ii) Heart (myocardial cells).
iii) Kidney (especially epithelial cells of proximal convoluted
tubules).
4.
Rapidity of development. Sudden vascular obstruction
results in more severe effects of ischaemia than if it is gradual
since there is less time for collaterals to develop.
5.
Degree of vascular occlusion. Complete vascular
obstruction results in more severe ischaemic injury than the
partial occlusion.
EFFECTS. The effects of ischaemia are variable and range
from ‘no change’ to ‘sudden death’.
1.
No effects on the tissues, if the collateral channels
develop adequately so that the effect of ischaemia fails to
occur.
2.
Functional disturbances. These result when collateral
channels are able to supply blood during normal activity but
the supply is not adequate to withstand the effect of exertion.
The examples are angina pectoris and intermittent
claudication.
3.
Cellular changes. Partial and gradual ischaemia may
produce cellular changes such as cloudy swelling, fatty

126
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
change, ischaemic atrophy and replacement fibrosis.
Infarction results when the deprivation of blood supply is
complete so as to cause necrosis of tissue affected.
4.
Sudden death. The cause of sudden death from ischaemia
is usually myocardial and cerebral infarction.
The most important and common outcome of ischaemia
is infarction which is discussed below.
INFARCTION
DEFINITION. Infarction is the process of tissue necrosis
resulting from some form of circulatory insufficiency; the
localised area of necrosis so developed is called an infarct.
ETIOLOGY. All the causes of ischaemia discussed above
can cause infarction. There are a few other noteworthy
features in infarction:
Most commonly, infarcts are caused by interruption in
arterial blood supply, called ischaemic necrosis.
Less commonly, venous obstruction can produce infarcts
termed stagnant hypoxia.
Generally, sudden, complete, and continuous occlusion (e.g.
thrombosis or embolism) produces infarcts.
Infarcts may be produced by nonocclusive circulatory
insufficiency as well e.g. incomplete atherosclerotic narrowing
of coronary arteries may produce myocardial infarction due
to acute coronary insufficiency.
TYPES OF INFARCTS. Infarcts are classified depending
upon different features:
1.
According to their colour:
Pale or anaemic, due to arterial occlusion and are seen in
compact organs e.g. in the kidneys, heart, spleen.
Red or haemorrhagic, seen in soft loose tissues and are
caused either by pulmonary arterial obstruction (e.g. in the
lungs) or by arterial or venous occlusion (e.g. in the
intestines).
2.
According to their age:
Recent or fresh
Old or healed
3. According to presence or absence of infection:
Bland, when free of bacterial contamination
Septic, when infected.
PATHOGENESIS. The process of infarction takes place as
follows:
i)
Localised hyperaemia due to local anoxaemia occurs
immediately after obstruction of the blood supply.
ii) Within a few hours, the affected part becomes swollen
due to oedema and haemorrhage. The amount of haemorrhage
is variable, being more marked in the lungs and spleen, and
less extensive in the kidneys and heart.
iii) Cellular changes such as cloudy swelling and degenera-
tion appear early, while death of the cells (i.e. necrosis) occurs
in 12-48 hours.
iv) There is progressive proteolysis of the necrotic tissue and
there is lysis of the red cells.
v) An acute inflammatory reaction and hyperaemia appear at
the same time in the surrounding tissues in response to
products of proteolysis.
vi) Blood pigments, haematoidin and haemosiderin, liberated
by lysis of RBCs are deposited in the infarct. At this stage,
most infarcts become pale-grey due to loss of red cells.
vii) Following this, there is progressive ingrowth of granulation
tissue from the margin of the infarct so that eventually the
infarct is replaced by a fibrous scar. Dystrophic calcification
may occur sometimes.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Some general morpho-
logical features of infarcts are common to infarcts of all
organ sites.
Grossly, infarcts of solid organs are usually wedge-
shaped, the apex pointing towards the occluded artery
and the wide base on the surface of the organ. Infarcts
due to arterial occlusion are generally pale while those
due to venous obstruction are haemorrhagic. Most infarcts
become pale later as the red cells are lysed but pulmonary
infarcts never become pale due to extensive amount of
blood. Cerebral infarcts are poorly defined with central
softening (encephalomalacia). Recent infarcts are generally
slightly elevated over the surface while the old infarcts
are shrunken and depressed under the surface of the
organ.
Microscopically, the pathognomonic cytologic change in
all infarcts is coagulative (ischaemic) necrosis of the
affected area of tissue or organ. In cerebral infarcts,
however, there is characteristic liquefactive necrosis. Some
amount of haemorrhage is generally present in any infarct.
At the periphery of an infarct, inflammatory reaction is
noted. Initially, neutrophils predominate but subsequently
macrophages and fibroblasts appear. Eventually, the
necrotic area is replaced by fibrous scar tissue, which at
times may show dystrophic calcification. In cerebral
infarcts, the liquefactive necrosis is followed by gliosis i.e.
replacement by microglial cells distended by fatty material
(gitter cells).
Infarcts of Different Organs
Fig. 5.26 shows the organs most commonly affected by
infarction.
A few representative examples of infarction of some
organs (lungs, kidney, liver and spleen) are discussed below.
Myocardial infarction (Chapter 16), cerebral infarction
(Chapter 30) and infarction of the small intestines (Chapter
20) are covered in detail later in respective chapters of
Systemic Pathology.
INFARCT LUNG. Embolism of the pulmonary arteries may
produce pulmonary infarction, though not always. This is
because lungs receive blood supply from bronchial arteries
as well, and thus occlusion of pulmonary artery ordinarily
does not produce infarcts. However, it may occur in patients

127
CHAPTER 5
Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics
who have inadequate circulation such as in chronic lung
diseases and congestive heart failure.
Grossly, pulmonary infarcts are classically wedge-shaped
with base on the pleura, haemorrhagic, variable in size,
and most often in the lower lobes (Fig. 5.27). Fibrinous
Figure 5.26
Common locations of systemic infarcts following arterial
embolism.
pleuritis usually covers the area of infarct. Cut surface is
dark purple and may show the blocked vessel near the
apex of the infarcted area. Old organised and healed
pulmonary infarcts appear as retracted fibrous scars.
Microscopically, the characteristic histologic feature is
coagulative necrosis of the alveolar walls. Initially, there
is infiltration by neutrophils and intense alveolar capillary
congestion, but later their place is taken by haemosiderin,
phagocytes and granulation tissue (Fig. 5.28).
INFARCT KIDNEY. Renal infarction is common, found in
up to 5% of autopsies. Majority of them are caused by
thromboemboli, most commonly originating from the heart
such as in mural thrombi in the left atrium, myocardial
infarction, vegetative endocarditis and from aortic aneurysm.
Less commonly, renal infarcts may occur due to advanced
renal artery atherosclerosis, arteritis and sickle cell anaemia.
Grossly, renal infarcts are often multiple and may be
bilateral. Characteristically, they are pale or anaemic and
wedge-shaped with base resting under the capsule and
apex pointing towards the medulla. Generally, a narrow
rim of preserved renal tissue under the capsule is spared
because it draws its blood supply from the capsular
vessels. Cut surface of renal infarct in the first 2 to 3 days
is red and congested but by 4th day the centre becomes
pale yellow. At the end of one week, the infarct is typically
anaemic and depressed below the surface of the kidney
(Fig. 5.29).
Microscopically, the affected area shows characteristic
coagulative necrosis of renal parenchyma i.e. there are
ghosts of renal tubules and glomeruli without intact nuclei
and cytoplasmic content. The margin of the infarct shows
inflammatory reaction—initially acute but later
macrophages and fibrous tissue predominate (Fig. 5.30).

dark tan firm areas (arrow) with base on the pleura.

alveoli filled with blood.

128
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
INFARCT SPLEEN. Spleen is one of the common sites for
infarction. Splenic infarction results from occlusion of the
splenic artery or its branches. Occlusion is caused most
commonly by thromboemboli arising in the heart (e.g. in
mural thrombi in the left atrium, vegetative endocarditis,
myocardial infarction), and less frequently by obstruction of
microcirculation (e.g. in myeloproliferative diseases, sickle
cell anaemia, arteritis, Hodgkin’s disease, bacterial
infections).
Grossly, splenic infarcts are often multiple. They are
characteristically pale or anaemic and wedge-shaped with
their base at the periphery and apex pointing towards
hilum (Fig. 5.31).
Microscopically, the features are similar to those found
in anaemic infarcts in kidney. Coagulative necrosis and
inflammatory reaction are seen. Later, the necrotic tissue
is replaced by shrunken fibrous scar (Fig. 5.32).
INFARCT LIVER. Just as in lungs, infarcts in the liver are
uncommon due to dual blood supply—from portal vein and
from hepatic artery. Obstruction of the portal vein is usually
secondary to other diseases such as hepatic cirrhosis,
intravenous invasion of primary carcinoma of the liver,

depressed on the surface. The apex lies internally and wide base is on

coagulative necrosis i.e. intact outlines of necrosed cells. There is acute
inflammatory infiltrate at the periphery of the infarct.

carcinoma of the pancreas and pylephlebitis. Occlusion of
portal vein or its branches generally does not produce
ischaemic infarction but instead reduced blood supply to
hepatic parenchyma causes non-ischaemic infarct called
infarct of Zahn. Obstruction of the hepatic artery or its
branches, on the other hand, caused by arteritis,
arteriosclerosis, bland or septic emboli, results in ischaemic
infarcts of the liver.
Grossly, ischaemic infarcts of the liver are usually anaemic
but sometimes may be haemorrhagic due to stuffing of
the site by blood from the portal vein. Infarcts of Zahn
(non-ischaemic infarcts) produce sharply defined red-blue
area in liver parenchyma.
Microscopically, ischaemic infarcts show characteristics
of pale or anaemic infarcts as in kidney or spleen. Infarcts
of Zahn occurring due to reduced portal blood flow over
a long duration result in chronic atrophy of hepatocytes
and dilatation of sinusoids.
Table 5.9 summarises the gross appearance and the usual
outcome of the common types of infarction.

INFLAMMATION
INTRODUCTION
DEFINITION AND CAUSES. Inflammation is defined as
the local response of living mammalian tissues to injury due
to any agent. It is a body defense reaction in order to eliminate
or limit the spread of injurious agent, followed by removal
of the necrosed cells and tissues.
The agents causing inflammation may be as under:
1.
Infective agents like bacteria, viruses and their toxins,
fungi, parasites.
2.
Immunological agents like cell-mediated and antigen-
antibody reactions.
3.
Physical agents like heat, cold, radiation, mechanical
trauma.
4.
Chemical agents like organic and inorganic poisons.
5.
Inert materials such as foreign bodies.
Thus, inflammation is distinct from infection—while
inflammation is a protective response by the body to variety
of etiologic agents (infectious or non-infectious), while
infection is invasion into the body by harmful microbes and
their resultant ill-effects by toxins. Inflammation involves 2
basic processes with some overlapping, viz. early inflam-
matory response and later followed by healing. Though both
these processes generally have protective role against
injurious agents, inflammation and healing may cause
considerable harm to the body as well e.g. anaphylaxis to
bites by insects or reptiles, drugs, toxins, atherosclerosis,
chronic rheumatoid arthritis, fibrous bands and adhesions
in intestinal obstruction.
As discussed earlier (Chapter 4), “immunity or immune
reaction” and “inflammatory response” by the host are both
protective mechanisms in the body—inflammation is the
visible response to an immune reaction, and activation of
immune response is almost essential before inflammatory
response appears.
SIGNS OF INFLAMMATION. The Roman writer Celsus
in 1st century A.D. named the famous 4 cardinal signs of
inflammation as:
rubor (redness);
tumor (swelling);
calor (heat); and
dolor (pain).
To these, fifth sign functio laesa (loss of function) was
later added by Virchow. The word inflammation means
burning. This nomenclature had its origin in old times but
now we know that burning is only one of the signs of
inflammation.
TYPES OF INFLAMMATION. Depending upon the defense
capacity of the host and duration of response, inflammation
can be classified as acute and chronic.
A. Acute inflammation is of short duration (lasting less than
2 weeks) and represents the early body reaction, resolves
quickly and is usually followed by healing.
The main features of acute inflammation are:
1.
accumulation of fluid and plasma at the affected site;
2.
intravascular activation of platelets; and
3.
polymorphonuclear neutrophils as inflammatory cells.
Sometimes, the acute inflammatory response may be
quite severe and is termed as fulminant acute inflammation.
B. Chronic inflammation is of longer duration and occurs
either after the causative agent of acute inflammation persists
for a long time, or the stimulus is such that it induces chronic
inflammation from the beginning. A variant, chronic active
inflammation, is the type of chronic inflammation in which
during the course of disease there are acute exacerbations of
activity.
The characteristic feature of chronic inflammation is
presence of chronic inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes,
plasma cells and macrophages, granulation tissue formation,
and in specific situations as granulomatous inflammation.
In some instances, the term subacute inflammation is used
for the state of inflammation between acute and chronic.
ACUTE INFLAMMATION
Acute inflammatory response by the host to any agent is a
continuous process but for the purpose of discussion, it can
be divided into following two events:
I.
Vascular events.
II. Cellular events.
Intimately linked to these two processes is the release of
mediators of acute inflammation, discussed just thereafter.
I.
VASCULAR EVENTS
Alteration in the microvasculature (arterioles, capillaries and
venules) is the earliest response to tissue injury. These
alterations include: haemodynamic changes and changes in
vascular permeability.
Haemodynamic Changes
The earliest features of inflammatory response result from
changes in the vascular flow and calibre of small blood
vessels in the injured tissue. The sequence of these changes
is as under:
1.
Irrespective of the type of injury, immediate vascular res-
ponse is of transient vasoconstriction of arterioles. With mild
Inflammation and Healing

131
CHAPTER 6
Inflammation and Healing
form of injury, the blood flow may be re-established in 3-5
seconds while with more severe injury the vasoconstriction
may last for about 5 minutes.
2.
Next follows persistent progressive vasodilatation which
involves mainly the arterioles, but to a lesser extent, affects
other components of the microcirculation like venules and
capillaries. This change is obvious within half an hour of
injury. Vasodilatation results in increased blood volume in
microvascular bed of the area, which is responsible for
redness and warmth at the site of acute inflammation.
3.
Progressive vasodilatation, in turn, may elevate the local
hydrostatic pressure resulting in transudation of fluid into
the extracellular space. This is responsible for swelling at
the local site of acute inflammation.
4.
Slowing or stasis of microcirculation follows which
causes increased concentration of red cells, and thus, raised
blood viscosity.
5.
Stasis or slowing is followed by leucocytic margination
or peripheral orientation of leucocytes (mainly neutrophils)
along the vascular endothelium. The leucocytes stick to the
vascular endothelium briefly, and then move and migrate
through the gaps between the endothelial cells into the
extravascular space. This process is known as emigration
(discussed later in detail).
The features of haemodynamic changes in inflammation
are best demonstrated by the Lewis experiment. Lewis
induced the changes in the skin of inner aspect of forearm
by firm stroking with a blunt point. The reaction so elicited
is known as triple response or red line response consisting of
the following (Fig. 6.1):
i)
Red line appears within a few seconds following stroking
and is due to local vasodilatation of capillaries and
venules.
ii) Flare is the bright reddish appearance or flush surroun-
ding the red line and results from vasodilatation of the
adjacent arterioles.
iii) Wheal is the swelling or oedema of the surrounding skin
occurring due to transudation of fluid into the extra-
vascular space.
These features, thus, elicit the classical signs of inflam-
mation—redness, heat, swelling and pain.
Altered  Vascular Permeability
PATHOGENESIS. In and around the inflamed tissue, there
is accumulation of oedema fluid in the interstitial compart-
ment which comes from blood plasma by its escape through
the endothelial wall of peripheral vascular bed. In the initial
stage, the escape of fluid is due to vasodilatation and
consequent elevation in hydrostatic pressure. This is
transudate in nature. But subsequently, the characteristic
inflammatory oedema, exudate, appears by increased
vascular permeability of microcirculation. The differences
between transudate and exudate, are already summarised
in Table 4.1 (see page 96).
The appearance of inflammatory oedema due to increased
vascular permeability of microvascular bed is explained on
the basis of Starling’s hypothesis. In normal circumstances,
the fluid balance is maintained by two opposing sets of forces:
i)
Forces that cause outward movement of fluid from
microcirculation are intravascular hydrostatic pressure and
colloid osmotic pressure of interstitial fluid.
ii) Forces that cause inward movement of interstitial fluid
into circulation are intravascular colloid osmotic pressure and
hydrostatic pressure of interstitial fluid.
Whatever little fluid is left in the interstitial compartment
is drained away by lymphatics and, thus, no oedema results
normally (Fig. 6.2,A). However, in inflamed tissues, the
endothelial lining of microvasculature becomes more leaky.
Consequently, intravascular colloid osmotic pressure
decreases and osmotic pressure of the interstitial fluid
increases resulting in excessive outward flow of fluid into
the interstitial compartment which is exudative inflammatory
oedema (Fig. 6.2,B).
MECHANISMS OF INCREASED VASCULAR PERME-
ABILITY. In acute inflammation, normally non-permeable
endothelial layer of microvasculature becomes leaky. This is
explained by one or more of the following mechanisms which
are diagrammatically illustrated in Fig. 6.3.
Figure 6.1
A, ‘Triple response’ elicited by firm stroking of skin of forearm with a pencil. B, Diagrammatic view of microscopic features of triple
response of the skin.

132
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
i)
Contraction of endothelial cells. This is the most
common mechanism of increased leakiness that affects
venules exclusively while capillaries and arterioles remain
unaffected. The endothelial cells develop temporary gaps
between them due to their contraction resulting in vascular
leakiness. It is mediated by the release of histamine,
bradykinin and other chemical mediators. The response
begins immediately after injury, is usually reversible, and is
for short duration (15-30 minutes).
Example of such immediate transient leakage is mild thermal
injury of skin of forearm.
ii) Retraction of endothelial cells. In this mechanism, there
is structural re-organisation of the cytoskeleton of endothelial
cells that causes reversible retraction at the intercellular
junctions. This change too affects venules and is mediated
by cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis
factor (TNF)-α. The onset of response takes 4-6 hours after
injury and lasts for 2-4 hours or more (somewhat delayed and
prolonged leakage).
The example of this type of response exists in vitro
experimental work only.
iii) Direct injury to endothelial cells. Direct injury to the
endothelium causes cell necrosis and appearance of physical
gaps at the sites of detached endothelial cells. Process of
thrombosis is initiated at the site of damaged endothelial
cells. The change affects all levels of microvasculature
(venules, capillaries and arterioles). The increased
permeability may either appear immediately after injury and
last for several hours or days (immediate sustained leakage), or
may occur after a delay of 2-12 hours and last for hours or
days (delayed prolonged leakage).
The examples of immediate sustained leakage are severe
bacterial infections while delayed prolonged leakage may
occur following moderate thermal injury and radiation
injury.
iv) Endothelial injury mediated by leucocytes. Adherence
of leucocytes to the endothelium at the site of inflammation
may result in activation of leucocytes. The activated

CHAPTER 6
Inflammation and Healing
leucocytes release proteolytic enzymes and toxic oxygen
species which may cause endothelial injury and increased
vascular leakiness. This form of increased vascular leakiness
affects mostly venules and is a late response.
The examples are seen in sites where leucocytes adhere
to the vascular endothelium e.g. in pulmonary venules and
capillaries.
v) Leakiness in neovascularisation. In addition, the newly
formed capillaries under the influence of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) during the process of repair and in
tumours are excessively leaky.
These mechanisms are summarised in Table 6.1.
II. CELLULAR EVENTS
The cellular phase of inflammation consists of 2 processes:
1.
exudation of leucocytes; and
2.
phagocytosis.
Exudation of Leucocytes
The escape of leucocytes from the lumen of microvasculature
to the interstitial tissue is the most important feature of
inflammatory response. In acute inflammation, polymorpho-
nuclear neutrophils (PMNs) comprise the first line of body
defense, followed later by monocytes and macrophages.
The changes leading to migration of leucocytes are as
follows (Fig. 6.4):
1.
CHANGES IN THE FORMED ELEMENTS OF BLOOD.
In the early stage of inflammation, the rate of flow of blood
is increased due to vasodilatation. But subsequently, there
is slowing or stasis of bloodstream. With stasis, changes in
the normal axial flow of blood in the microcirculation take
place. The normal axial flow consists of central stream of
cells comprised by leucocytes and RBCs and peripheral cell-
free layer of plasma close to vessel wall. Due to slowing and

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
stasis, the central stream of cells widens and peripheral
plasma zone becomes narrower because of loss of plasma
by exudation. This phenomenon is known as margination.
As a result of this redistribution, the neutrophils of the central
column come close to the vessel wall; this is known as
pavementing.
2.
ROLLING AND ADHESION. Peripherally marginated
and pavemented neutrophils slowly roll over the endothelial
cells lining the vessel wall (rolling phase).  This is followed by
the transient bond between the leucocytes and endothelial
cells becoming firmer (adhesion phase). The following
molecules bring about rolling and adhesion phases:
i)
Selectins are expressed on the surface of activated
endothelial cells which recognise specific carbohydrate
groups found on the surface of neutrophils, the most
important of which is s-Lewis X molecule. While P-selectin
(preformed and stored in endothelial cells and platelets) is
involved in rolling, E-selectin (synthesised by cytokine-
activated endothelial cells) is associated with both rolling and
adhesion; L-selectin (expressed on the surface of lymphocytes
and neutrophils) is responsible for homing of circulating
lymphocytes to the endothelial cells in lymph nodes.
ii) Integrins on the endothelial cell surface are activated
during the process of loose and transient adhesions between
endothelial cells and leucocytes. At the same time the
receptors for integrins on the neutrophils are also stimulated.
This process brings about firm adhesion between leucocyte
and endothelium.
iii) Immunoglobulin gene superfamily adhesion molecule
such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and
vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) allow a tighter
adhesion and stabilise the interaction between leucocytes and
endothelial cells. Platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-
1 (PECAM-1) or CD31 may also be involved in leucocyte
migration from the endothelial surface.
3.
EMIGRATION. After sticking of neutrophils to endo-
thelium, the former move along the endothelial surface till a
suitable site between the endothelial cells is found where
the neutrophils throw out cytoplasmic pseudopods.
Subsequently, the neutrophils lodged between the
endothelial cells and basement membrane cross the basement
membrane by damaging it locally with secreted collagenases
and escape out into the extravascular space; this is known as
emigration. The damaged basement membrane is repaired
almost immediately. As already mentioned, neutrophils are
the dominant cells in acute inflammatory exudate in the first
24 hours, and monocyte-macrophages appear in the next
24-48 hours. However, neutrophils are short-lived (24-48
hours) while monocyte-macrophages survive much longer.
Simultaneous to emigration of leucocytes, escape of red
cells through gaps between the endothelial cells, diapedesis,
takes place. It is a passive phenomenon—RBCs being forced
out either by raised hydrostatic pressure or may escape
through the endothelial defects left after emigration of
leucocytes. Diapedesis gives haemorrhagic appearance to the
inflammatory exudate.
4.
CHEMOTAXIS. The chemotactic factor-mediated
transmigration of leucocytes after crossing several barriers
(endothelium, basement membrane, perivascular myofibro-
blasts and matrix) to reach the interstitial tissues is called
chemotaxis. The concept of chemotaxis is well illustrated by
Boyden’s chamber experiment. In this, a millipore filter (3 μm
pore size) separates the suspension of leucocytes from the
test solution in tissue culture chamber. If the test solution
contains chemotactic agent, the leucocytes migrate through
the pores of filter towards the chemotactic agent (Fig. 6.5).
The following agents act as potent chemotactic substances
or chemokines for neutophils:
i)
Leukotriene B4 (LT-B4), a product of lipooxygenase
pathway of arachidonic acid metabolites
ii) Components of complement system (C5a and C3a in
particular)
iii) Cytokines (Interleukins, in particular IL-8)
iv) Soluble bacterial products (such as formylated peptides).
In addition to neutrophils, other inflammatory cells too
respond and partake in inflammation and there are
chemokines for them, e.g. monocyte chemoattractant protein
(MCP-1), eotaxin chemotactic for eosinophils, NK cells for
recognising virally infected cells etc.
Phagocytosis
Phagocytosis is defined as the process of engulfment of solid
particulate material by the cells (cell-eating). The cells
performing this function are called phagocytes. There are 2
main types of phagocytic cells:
i)
Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) which appear
early in acute inflammatory response, sometimes called as
microphages.
ii) Circulating monocytes and fixed tissue mononuclear
phagocytes, commonly called as macrophages.
Neutrophils and macrophages on reaching the tissue
spaces produce several proteolyitc enzymes—lysozyme,
protease, collagenase, elastase, lipase, proteinase, gelatinase,
and acid hydrolases. These enzymes degrade collagen and
extracellular matrix. The microbe undergoes the process of
phagocytosis  by polymorphs and macrophages and involves
the following 3 steps (Fig. 6.6):
Figure 6.5

dotted line. A, Suspension of leucocytes above is separated from test
solution below. B, Lower half of chamber shows migration of neutrophils

Recognition and attachment

Engulfment
3.
Killing and degradation
1.
RECOGNITION AND ATTACHMENT
Phagocytosis is initiated by the expression of surface
receptors on macrophages which recognise microorganisms:
mannose receptor and scavenger receptor. The process of
phagocytosis is further enhanced when the microorganisms
are coated with specific proteins, opsonins, from the serum
or they get opsonised. Opsonins establish a bond between
bacteria and the cell membrane of phagocytic cell. The main
opsonins present in the serum and their corresponding
receptors on the surface of phagocytic cells (PMNs or
macrophages) are as under:
i) IgG opsonin is the Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G; it is
the naturally occurring antibody in the serum that coats the
bacteria while the PMNs possess receptors for the same.
ii) C3b opsonin is the fragment generated by activation of
complement pathway. It is strongly chemotactic for attracting
PMNs to bacteria.
iii) Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins in the plasma
which bind to bacterial cell wall.
2.
ENGULFMENT
The opsonised particle bound to the surface of phagocyte is
ready to be engulfed. This is accomplished by formation of
cytoplasmic pseudopods around the particle due to
activation of actin filaments beneath cell wall, enveloping it
in a phagocytic vacuole. Eventually, the plasma membrane
enclosing the particle breaks from the cell surface so that
membrane lined phagocytic vacuole or phagosome lies
internalised and free in the cell cytoplasm. The phagosome
fuses with one or more lysosomes of the cell and form bigger
vacuole called phagolysosome.
3.
KILLING AND DEGRADATION
Next comes the stage of killing and degradation of micro-
organism to dispose it off justifying the function of
phagocytes as scavanger cells. The microorganisms after
being killed by antibacterial substances are degraded by
hydrolytic enzymes. However, this mechanism fails to kill
and degrade some bacteria like tubercle bacilli.
Disposal of microorganisms can proceed by following
mechanisms:
A. Intracellular mechanisms:
i)
Oxidative bactericidal mechanism by oxygen free radicals
a) MPO-dependent
b) MPO-independent
ii) Oxidative bactericidal mechanism by lysosomal granules
iii) Non-oxidative bactericidal mechanism
B. Extracellular mechanisms:
These mechanisms are discussed below.
A. INTRACELLULAR MECHANISMS. There are
intracellular metabolic pathways which more commonly kill
microbes by oxidative mechanism and less often non-
oxidative pathways.
i)
Oxidative bactericidal mechanism by oxygen free
radicals. An important mechanism of microbicidal killing is
by oxidative damage by the production of reactive oxygen
metabolites (O’2 H2O2, OH’, HOCl, HOI, HOBr).
A phase of increased oxygen consumption (‘respiratory
burst’) by activated phagocytic leucocytes requires the
essential presence of NADPH oxidase.
NADPH-oxidase present in the cell membrane of
phagosome reduces oxygen to superoxide ion (O’2):
2O2
 2O’2
NADPH
(Superoxide
oxidase
anion)
 NADPH
                     NADP + H+
Superoxide is subsequently converted into H2O2 which
has bactericidal properties:
2O’2 + 2H+
H2O2
(Hydrogen peroxide)
This type of bactericidal activity is carried out either via
enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) present in the azurophilic
granules of neutrophils and monocytes, or independent of
enzyme MPO, as under:
a) MPO-dependent killing. In this mechanism, the enzyme
MPO acts on H2O2 in the presence of halides (chloride, iodide

or bromide) to form hypohalous acid (HOCl, HOI, HOBr).
This is called H2O2-MPO-halide system and is more potent
antibacterial system in polymorphs than H2O2 alone:
MPO
H2O2
HOCl + H2O
Cl’, Br’, I’
(Hypochlorous acid)
b) MPO-independent killing. Mature macrophages lack the
enzyme MPO and they carry out bactericidal activity by
producing OH– ions and superoxide singlet oxygen (O’) from
H2O2 in the presence of O’2 (Haber-Weiss reaction) or in the
presence of Fe++ (Fenton reaction):
Reactive oxygen metabolites are particularly useful in
eliminating microbial organisms that grow within
phagocytes e.g. M. tuberculosis, Histoplasma capsulatum.
ii) Oxidative bactericidal mechanism by lysosomal
granules. In this mechanism, the preformed granule-stored
products of neutrophils and macrophages are discharged or
secreted into the phagosome and the extracellular
environment. While the role of MPO is already highlighted
above, others liberated by degranulation of macrophages and
neutrophils are protease, trypsinase, phospholipase, and
alkaline phosphatase. Progressive degranulation of
neutrophils and macrophages along with oxygen free radicals
degrades proteins i.e. induces proteolysis.
iii) Non-oxidative bactericidal mechanism. Some agents
released from the granules of phagocytic cells do not require
oxygen for bactericidal activity. These include the following:
a) Granules. Some of liberated lysosomal granules do not kill
by oxidative damage but cause lysis of within phagosome.
These are lysosomal hydrolases, permeability increasing
factors, cationic proteins (defensins), lipases, ptoteases,
DNAases.
b) Nitric oxide. Nitric oxide reactive free radicals similar to
oxygen free radicals are formed by nitric oxide synthase and
is a potent mechanism of microbial killing. Nitric oxide is
produced by endothelial cells as well as by activated
macrophages.
B. EXTRACELLULAR MECHANISMS. Following
mechanisms explain the bactericidal activity at extracellular
level:
i) Granules. Degranulation of macrophages and neutrophils
explained above continues to exert its effects of proteolysis
outside the cells as well.
ii) Immune mechanisms. As already discussed in Chapter
4, immune-mediated lysis of microbes takes place outside
the cells by mechanisms of cytolysis, antibody-mediated lysis
and by cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
CHEMICAL MEDIATORS OF INFLAMMATION
Also called as permeability factors or endogenous mediators
of increased vascular permeability, these are a large and
increasing number of endogenous compounds which can
enhance vascular permeability. However, currently many
chemical mediators have been identified which partake in
other processes of acute inflammation as well e.g.
vasodilatation, chemotaxis, fever, pain and cause tissue
damage.
The substances acting as chemical mediators of
inflammation may be released from the cells, the plasma, or
damaged tissue itself. They are broadly classified into 2 groups:
i)
mediators released by cells; and
ii) mediators originating from plasma.
Table 6.2 presents a list of chemical mediators of acute
inflammation.
Chemical mediators derived from various sources and
their contribution in acute inflammation are shown in
Fig. 6.7.
I.
Cell-derived Mediators
1.
VASOACTIVE AMINES. Two important pharmaco-
logically active amines that have role in the early
inflammatory response (first one hour) are histamine and 5-
hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or serotonin; another recently
added group is of neuropeptides.
i)
Histamine. It is stored in the granules of mast cells,
basophils and platelets. Histamine is released from these cells
by various agents as under:
a) Stimuli or substances inducing acute inflammation e.g.
heat, cold, irradiation, trauma, irritant chemicals,
immunologic reactions etc.
b) Anaphylatoxins like fragments of complement C3a, and
C5a, which increase vascular permeability and cause
oedema in tissues.
c) Histamine-releasing factors from neutrophils, monocytes
and platelets.
d) Interleukins.

CHAPTER 6
Inflammation and Healing
The main actions of histamine are: vasodilatation,
increased vascular (venular) permeability, itching and pain.
Stimulation of mast cells and basophils also releases products
of arachidonic acid metabolism including the release of slow-
reacting substances of anaphylaxis (SRS-As). The SRS-As consist
of various leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4).
ii) 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin). It is present
in tissues like chromaffin cells of GIT, spleen, nervous tissue,
mast cells and platelets. The actions of 5-HT are similar to
histamine but it is a less potent mediator of increased vascular
permeability and vasodilatation than histamine. It may be
mentioned here that carcinoid tumour is a serotonin-secreting
tumour (Chapter 20).
iii) Neuropeptides. Another class of vasoactive amines is
tachykinin neuropeptides, such as substance P, neurokinin
A, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and somatostatin.
These small peptides are produced in the central and
peripheral nervous systems.
The major proinflammatory actions of these neuropeptides
is as follows:
a) Increased vascular permeability.
b) Transmission of pain stimuli.
c)
Mast cell degranulation.
2.
ARACHIDONIC ACID METABOLITES (EICO-
SANOIDS). Arachidonic acid metabolites or eicosanoids are
the most potent mediators of inflammation, much more than
oxygen free radicals.
Arachidonic acid is a fatty acid, eicosatetraenoic acid;
Greek word ‘eikosa’ means ‘twenty’ because of 20 carbon atom
composition of this fatty acid.  Arachidonic acid is a
constituent of the phospholipid cell membrane, besides its
presence in some constituents of diet. Arachidonic acid is
released from the cell membrane by phospholipases. It is then
activated to form arachidonic acid metabolites or eicosanoids
by one of the following 2 pathways: via cyclo-oxygenase
pathway and via lipo-oxygenase pathway:
i)
Metabolites via cyclo-oxygenase pathway: Prostaglan-
dins, thromboxane A2, prostacyclin. The name ‘prosta-
glandin’ was first given to a substance found in human
seminal fluid but now the same substance has been isolated
from a number of other body cells. Prostaglandins and related
compounds are also called autocoids because these substances
are mainly auto- and paracrine agents. The terminology used
for prostaglandins is abbreviation as PG followed by suffix
of an alphabet and a serial number e.g. PGG2, PGE2 etc.
Cyclo-oxygenase (COX), a fatty acid enzyme present as
COX-1 and COX-2, acts on activated arachidonic acid to form
prostaglandin endoperoxide (PGG2). PGG2 is enzymatically
transformed into PGH2 with generation of free radical of
oxygen. PGH2 is further acted upon by enzymes and results
in formation of the following 3 metabolites (Fig. 6.8):
a) Prostaglandins (PGD2, PGE2 and PGF2-α). PGD2 and PGE2
act on blood vessels to cause increased venular permeability,
vasodilatation and bronchodilatation and inhibit
inflammatory cell function. PGF2-α induces vasodilatation
and bronchoconstriction.
b) Thromboxane A2 (TXA2). Platelets contain the enzyme
thromboxane synthetase and hence the metabolite,
thromboxane A2, formed is active in platelet aggregation,
besides its role as a vasoconstrictor and broncho-constrictor.
c) Prostacyclin (PGI2). PGI2 induces vasodilatation, broncho-
dilatation and inhibits platelet aggregation.
d) Resolvins are a newly described derivative of COX
pathway. These mediators act by inhibiting production of
pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, resolvins are actually
helpful—drugs such as aspirin act by inhibiting COX activity
and stimulating production of resolvins.
It may be mentioned here that some of the major anti-
inflammatory drugs act by inhibiting activity of the enzyme
COX; e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
COX-2 inhibitors.
ii) Metabolites via lipo-oxygenase pathway: 5-HETE,
leukotrienes, lipoxins. The enzyme, lipo-oxygenase, a
Figure 6.7

138
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
predominant enzyme in neutrophils, acts on activated
arachidonic acid to form hydroperoxy eicosatetraenoic acid
(5-HPETE) which on further peroxidation forms following 2
metabolites (Fig. 6.9):
a) 5-HETE (hydroxy compound), an intermediate product,
is a potent chemotactic agent for neutrophils.
b) Leukotrienes (LT) are so named as they were first isolated
from leucocytes. Firstly, unstable leukotriene A4 (LTA4) is
formed which is acted upon by enzymes to form LTB4
(chemotactic for phagocytic cells and stimulates phagocytic
cell adherence) while LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4 have common
actions by causing smooth muscle contraction and thereby
induce vasoconstriction, bronchoconstriction and increased
vascular permeability; hence they are also called as slow-
reacting substances of anaphylaxis (SRS-As).
c)
Lipoxins (LX) are a recently described product of
lipooxygenase pathway. Lipooxygenase-12 present in
platelets acts on LTA4 derived from neutrophils and forms
LXA4 and LXB4. Lipoxins act to regulate and counterbalance
actions of leukotrienes.
3.
LYSOSOMAL COMPONENTS. The inflammatory
cells—neutrophils and monocytes, contain lysosomal
granules which on release elaborate a variety of mediators
of inflammation. These are as under:
i)
Granules of neutrophils. Neutrophils have 3 types of
granules: primary or azurophil, secondary or specific, and
tertiary.
a)
Primary or azurophil granules are large azurophil granules
which contain functionally active enzymes. These are
myeloperoxidase, acid hydrolases, acid phosphatase,
lysozyme, defensin (cationic protein), phospholipase,
cathepsin G, elastase, and protease.
b) Secondary or specific granules contain alkaline phosphatase,
lactoferrin, gelatinase, collagenase, lysozyme, vitamin-B12
binding proteins, plasminogen activator.
c)
Tertiary granules or C particles contain gelatinase and acid
hydrolases.
Myeloperoxidase causes oxidative lysis by generation of
oxygen free radicals, acid hydrolases act within the cell to
cause destruction of bacteria in phagolysosome while prote-
ases attack on the extracellular constituents such as basement
membrane, collagen, elastin, cartilage etc.
However, degradation of extracellular components like
collagen, basement membrane, fibrin and cartilage by
proteases results in harmful tissue destruction which is kept
in check by presence of antiproteases like α1-antitrypsin and
α2-macroglobulin.
ii) Granules of monocytes and tissue macrophages. These
cells on degranulation also release mediators of inflammation
like acid proteases, collagenase, elastase and plasminogen
activator. However, they are more active in chronic
inflammation than acting as mediators of acute inflammation.
4.
PLATELET ACTIVATING FACTOR (PAF). It is
released from IgE-sensitised basophils or mast cells, other
leucocytes, endothelium and platelets. Apart from its action
on platelet aggregation and release reaction, the actions of
PAF as mediator of inflammation are:
increased vascular permeability;
vasodilatation in low concentration and vasoconstriction
otherwise;
bronchoconstriction;
adhesion of leucocytes to endothelium; and
chemotaxis.
5.
CYTOKINES. Cytokines are polypeptide substances pro-
duced by activated lymphocytes (lymphokines) and activated
monocytes (monokines). These agents may act on ‘self’ cells
Figure 6.8
Arachidonic acid metabolites via cyclooxygenase pathway.

CHAPTER 6
Inflammation and Healing
producing them or on other cells. Although over 200
cytokines have been described, major cytokines acting as
mediators of inflammation are: interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumour
necrosis factor (TNF)-α and β, interferon (IFN)-γ, and
chemokines (IL-8, PF-4).
IL-1 and TNF-α are formed by activated macrophages
while TNF-β and IFN-γ are produced by activated T cells.
The chemokines include interleukin 8 (released from
activated macrophages) and platelet factor-4 from activated
platelets, both of which are potent chemoattractant for
inflammatory cells and hence their name.
The actions of various cytokines as mediator of
inflammation are as under:
i)
IL-1 and TNF-ααααα, TNF-βββββ induce endothelial effects in the
form of increased leucocyte adherence, thrombogenicity,
elaboration of other cytokines, fibroblastic proliferation and
acute phase reactions.
ii) IFN-γγγγγ causes activation of macrophages and neutrophils
and is associated with synthesis of nitric acid synthase.
iii) Chemokines are a family of chemoattractants for
inflammatory cells (as discussed above) and include:
IL-8 chemotactic for neutrophils;
platelet factor-4 chemotactic for neutrophils, monocytes
and eosinophils;
MCP-1 chemotactic for monocytes; and
eotaxin chemotactic for eosinophils.
6. FREE RADICALS: OXYGEN METABOLITES AND
NITRIC OXIDE. Free radicals act as potent mediator of
inflammation:
i) Oxygen-derived metabolites are released from activated
neutrophils and macrophages and include superoxide
oxygen (O’2), H2O2, OH’ and toxic NO products. These
oxygen-derived free radicals have the following action in
inflammation:
Endothelial cell damage and thereby increased vascular
permeability.
Activation of protease and inactivation of antiprotease
causing tissue matrix damage.
Damage to other cells.
The actions of free radicals are counteracted by
antioxidants present in tissues and serum which play a
protective role (page 33).
ii) Nitric oxide (NO) was originally described as vascular
relaxation factor produced by endothelial cells. Now it is
known that NO is formed by activated macrophages during
the oxidation of arginine by the action of enzyme, NO
synthase. NO plays the following role in mediating
inflammation:
Vasodilatation
Anti-platelet activating agent
Possibly microbicidal action.
II. Plasma-derived Mediators (Plasma Proteases)
These include the various products derived from activation
and interaction of 4 interlinked systems: kinin, clotting,
fibrinolytic and complement. Each of these systems has its
inhibitors and accelerators in plasma with negative and
positive feedback mechanisms respectively.
Hageman factor (factor XII) of clotting system plays a key role
in interactions of the four systems. Activation of factor XII in
vivo by contact with basement membrane and bacterial
endotoxins, and in vitro with glass or kaolin, leads to
activation of clotting, fibrinolytic and kinin systems. In
inflammation, activation of factor XII is brought about by
contact of the factor leaking through the endothelial gaps.
The end-products of the activated clotting, fibrinolytic and
kinin systems activate the complement system that generate
permeability factors. These permeability factors, in turn,
further activate clotting system.
The inter-relationship among 4 systems is summarised
in Fig. 6.10.
1.
THE KININ SYSTEM. This system on activation by
factor Xlla generates bradykinin, so named because of the
slow contraction of smooth muscle induced by it. First,
kallikrein is formed from plasma prekallikrein by the action
of prekallikrein activator which is a fragment of factor Xlla.
Kallikrein then acts on high molecular weight kininogen to
form bradykinin (Fig. 6.11).
Bradykinin acts in the early stage of inflammation and
its effects include:
smooth muscle contraction;
vasodilatation;
increased vascular permeability; and
pain.
2.
THE CLOTTING SYSTEM. Factor Xlla initiates the
cascade of the clotting system resulting in formation of
fibrinogen which is acted upon by thrombin to form fibrin
and fibrinopeptides (Fig. 6.12).
The actions of fibrinopeptides in inflammation are:
increased vascular permeability;
chemotaxis for leucocyte; and
anticoagulant activity.
3.
THE FIBRINOLYTIC SYSTEM. This system is activated
by plasminogen activator, the sources of which include
kallikrein of the kinin system, endothelial cells and
leucocytes. Plasminogen activator acts on plasminogen
present as component of plasma proteins to form plasmin.
Further breakdown of fibrin by plasmin forms fibrino-
peptides or fibrin split products (Fig. 6.13).
The actions of plasmin in inflammation are as follows:
activation of factor XII to form prekallikrein activator that
stimulates the kinin system to generate bradykinin;
splits off complement C3 to form C3a which is a
permeability factor; and
degrades fibrin to form fibrin split products which
increase vascular permeability and are chemotactic to
leucocytes.
4.
THE COMPLEMENT SYSTEM. The activation of
complement system can occur either:
i)
by classic pathway through antigen-antibody complexes;
or
ii) by alternate pathway via non-immunologic agents such as
bacterial toxins, cobra venoms and IgA.
Complement system on activation by either of these two
pathways yields activated products which include

140
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a and C5a),  and membrane attack
complex (MAC) i.e. C5b,C6,7,8,9.
The actions of activated complement system in
inflammation are as under:
C3a, C5a, C4a (anaphylatoxins) activate mast cells and
basophils to release of histamine, cause increased vascular
permeability causing oedema in tissues, augments
phagocytosis.
C3b is an opsonin.
C5a is chemotactic for leucocytes.
Membrane attack complex (MAC) (C5b-C9) is a lipid
dissolving agent and causes holes in the phospholipid
membrane of the cell.
REGULATION OF INFLAMMATION
The onset of inflammatory responses outlined above may
have potentially damaging influence on the host tissues as
evident in hypersensitivity conditions. Such self-damaging
effects are kept in check by the host mechanisms in order to
resolve inflammation. These mechanisms are as follows:
i)
Acute phase reactants. A variety of acute phase reactant
(APR) proteins are released in plasma in response to tissue
trauma and infection. Their major role is to protect the normal
cells from harmful effects of toxic molecules generated in
inflammation and to clear away the waste material. APRs
include the following:
i) Certain cellular protection factors (e.g. α1-antitrypsin, α1-
chymotrypsin, α2-antiplasmin, plasminogen activator
inhibitor): They protect the tissues from cytotoxic and
proteolytic damage.
ii) Some coagulation proteins (e.g. fibrinogen, plasminogen, von
Willebrand factor, factor VIII): They generate factors to
replace those consumed in coagulation.
iii) Transport proteins (e.g. ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin): They
carry generated factors.
iv) Immune agents (e.g. serum amyloid A and P component,
C-reactive protein): CRP is an opsonising agent for
phagocytosis and its levels are a useful indictor of
inflammation in the body.
v) Stress proteins (e.g. heat shock proteins—HSP, ubiquitin):
They are molecular chaperons who carry the toxic waste
within the cell to the lysosomes.
vi) Antioxidants (e.g. ceruloplasmin are active in elimination
of excess of oxygen free radicals.
The APR are synthesised mainly in the liver, and to some
extent in macrophages. APR along with systemic features of
fever and leucocytosis is termed ‘acute phase response’.

Pathway of kinin system.

141
CHAPTER 6
Inflammation and Healing
Deficient synthesis of APR leads to severe form of disease in
the form of chronic and repeated inflammatory responses.
ii) Glucosteroids. The endogenous glucocorticoids act as
anti-inflammatory agents. Their levels are raised in infection
and trauma by self-regulating mechanism.
iii) Free cytokine receptors. The presence of freely circulating
soluble receptors for cytokines in the serum correlates directly
with disease activity.
iv) Anti-inflammatory chemical mediators. As already
described, PGE2 or prostacyclin have both pro-inflammatory
as well as anti-inflammatory actions.
THE INFLAMMATORY CELLS
The cells participating in acute and chronic inflammation are
circulating leucocytes, plasma cells and tissue macrophages.
The structure, function and production of these cells are dealt
with in detail in Chapter 14. Here, it is pertinent to describe
the role of these cells in inflammation. Summary of their
morphology, characteristics and functions is given in
Table 6.3.
1. Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils (PMNs)
Commonly called as neutrophils or polymorphs, these cells
along with basophils and eosinophils are known as
granulocytes due to the presence of granules in the
cytoplasm. These granules contain many substances like
proteases, myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, esterase, aryl
sulfatase, acid and alkaline phosphatase, and cationic
proteins. The diameter of neutrophils ranges from 10 to
15 μm and are actively motile (Table 6.3,A). These cells
comprise 40-75% of circulating leucocytes and their number
is increased in blood (neutrophilia) and tissues in acute
bacterial infections. These cells arise in the bone marrow from
stem cells (Chapter 12).
The functions of neutrophils in inflammation are as
follows:
i)
Initial phagocytosis of microorganisms as they form the
first line of body defense in bacterial infection. The steps
involved are adhesion of neutrophils to vascular endo-
thelium, emigration through the vessel wall, chemotaxis,
engulfment, degranulation, killing and degradation of the
foreign material.
ii) Engulfment of antigen-antibody complexes and non-
microbial material.
iii) Harmful effect of neutrophils in causing basement
membrane destruction of the glomeruli and small blood
vessels.
2. Eosinophils
These are larger than neutrophils but are fewer in number,
comprising 1 to 6% of total blood leucocytes (Table 6.3,E).
Eosinophils share many structural and functional similarities
with neutrophils like their production in the bone marrow,
locomotion, phagocytosis, lobed nucleus and presence of
granules in the cytoplasm containing a variety of enzymes,
of which major basic protein and eosinophil cationic protein
are the most important which have bactericidal and toxic
action against helminthic parasites. However, granules of
eosinophils are richer in myeloperoxidase than neutrophils
and lack lysozyme. High level of steroid hormones leads to
fall in number of eosinophils and even disappearance from
blood.
The absolute number of eosinophils is increased in the
following conditions and, thus, they partake in inflammatory
responses associated with these conditions:
i)
allergic conditions;
ii) parasitic infestations;
iii) skin diseases; and
iv) certain malignant lymphomas.
3. Basophils (Mast Cells)
The basophils comprise about 1% of circulating leucocytes
and are morphologically and pharmacologically similar to
mast cells of tissue. These cells contain coarse basophilic
granules in the cytoplasm and a polymorphonuclear nucleus
(Table 6.3,F). These granules are laden with heparin and
histamine. Basophils and mast cells have receptors for IgE
and degranulate when cross-linked with antigen.

142
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
The role of these cells in inflammation are:
i)
in immediate and delayed type of hypersensitivity
reactions; and
ii) release of histamine by IgE-sensitised basophils.
4. Lymphocytes
Next to neutrophils, these cells are the most numerous of
the circulating leucocytes (20-45%). Apart from blood,
lymphocytes are present in large numbers in spleen, thymus,
lymph nodes and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
(MALT). They have scanty cytoplasm and consist almost
entirely of nucleus (Table 6.3,C).
Their role in antibody formation (B lymphocytes) and in
cell-mediated immunity (T lymphocytes) has been discussed
in Chapter 4; in addition these cells participate in the
following types of inflammatory responses:
i)
In tissues, they are dominant cells in chronic inflammation
and late stage of acute inflammation.
ii) In blood, their number is increased (lymphocytosis) in
chronic infections like tuberculosis.
5. Plasma Cells
These cells are larger than lymphocytes with more abundant
cytoplasm and an eccentric nucleus which has cart-wheel
pattern of chromatin (Table 6.3,D). Plasma cells are normally
not seen in peripheral blood. They develop from B
lymphocytes and are rich in RNA and γ-globulin in their
cytoplasm. There is an interrelationship between
plasmacytosis and hyperglobulinaemia. These cells are most
active in antibody synthesis.
Their number is increased in the following conditions:
i)
prolonged infection with immunological responses e.g.
in syphilis, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis;

6. Mononuclear-Phagocyte System
(Reticuloendothelial System)
This cell system includes cells derived from 2 sources with
common morphology, function and origin (Table 6.3,B).
These are as under:
Blood monocytes. These comprise 4-8% of circulating
leucocytes.
Tissue macrophages. These include the following cells in
different tissues:
i) Macrophages in inflammation.
ii) Histiocytes which are macrophages present in
connective tissues.
iii) Kupffer cells are macrophages of liver cells.
iv) Alveolar macrophages (type II pneumocytes) in lungs.
v) Macrophages/histiocytes of the bone marrow.
vi) Tingible body cells of germinal centres of lymph nodes.
vii) Littoral cells of splenic sinusoids.
viii) Osteoclasts in the bones.
ix) Microglial cells of the brain.
x) Langerhans’ cells/dendritic histiocytes of the skin.
xi) Hoffbauer cells of the placenta.
xii) Mesangial cells of glomerulus.
The mononuclear phagocytes are the scavenger cells of
the body as well as participate in immune system of the body
(Chapter 4); their functions in inflammation are as under:
Role of macrophages in inflammation. The functions of
mononuclear-phagocyte cells are as under:
i)
Phagocytosis (cell eating) and pinocytosis (cell drinking).
ii) Macrophages on activation by lymphokines released by T
lymphocytes or by non-immunologic stimuli elaborate a
variety of biologically active substances as under:
a) Proteases like collagenase and elastase which degrade
collagen and elastic tissue.
b) Plasminogen activator which activates the fibrinolytic
system.
c) Products of complement.
d) Some coagulation factors (factor V and thromboplastin)
which convert fibrinogen to fibrin.
e) Chemotactic agents for other leucocytes.
f)
Metabolites of arachidonic acid.
g) Growth promoting factors for fibroblasts, blood vessels
and granulocytes.
h) Cytokines like interleukin-1 and TNF-α.
i)
Oxygen-derived free radicals.
7. Giant Cells
A few examples of multinucleate giant cells exist in normal
tissues (e.g. osteoclasts in the bones, trophoblasts in placenta,
megakaryocytes in the bone marrow). However, in chronic
inflammation when the macrophages fail to deal with
particles to be removed, they fuse together and form
multinucleated giant cells. Besides, morphologically distinct
giant cells appear in some tumours also. Some of the common
types of giant cells are described below (Fig. 6.14):
A. Giant cells in inflammation:
 i) Foreign body giant cells. These contain numerous nuclei (up
to 100) which are uniform in size and shape and resemble
the nuclei of macrophages. These nuclei are scattered
throughout the cytoplasm. These are seen in chronic infective
granulomas, leprosy and tuberculosis.
ii) Langhans’ giant cells. These are seen in tuberculosis and
sarcoidosis. Their nuclei are like the nuclei of macrophages
and epithelioid cells. These nuclei are arranged either around
the periphery in the form of horseshoe or ring, or are clustered
at the two poles of the giant cell.
iii) Touton giant cells. These multinucleated cells have
vacuolated cytoplasm due to lipid content e.g. in xanthoma.
iv) Aschoff giant cells. These multinucleate giant cells are
derived from cardiac histiocytes and are seen in rheumatic
nodule (Chapter 16).
B. Giant cells in tumours:
i)
Anaplastic cancer giant cells. These are larger, have
numerous nuclei which are hyperchromatic and vary in size
Figure 6.14
Giant cells of various types. A, Foreign body giant cell with uniform nuclei dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. B, Langhans’ giant
cells with uniform nuclei arranged peripherally or clustered at the two poles. C, Touton giant cell with circular pattern of nuclei and vacuolated
cytoplasm. D, Anaplastic tumour giant cell with nuclei of variable size and shape. E, Reed-Sternberg cell. F, Osteoclastic tumour giant cell.

General Pathology and Basic Techniques
and shape. These giant cells are not derived from
macrophages but are formed from dividing nuclei of the
neoplastic cells e.g. carcinoma of the liver, various soft tissue
sarcomas etc.
ii) Reed-Sternberg cells. These are also malignant tumour
giant cells which are generally binucleate and are seen in
various histologic types of Hodgkin’s lymphomas.
iii) Giant cell tumour of bone. This tumour of the bones has
uniform distribution of osteoclastic giant cells spread in the
stroma.
FACTORS DETERMINING VARIATION IN
INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE
Although acute inflammation is typically characterised by
vascular and cellular events with emigration of neutrophilic
leucocytes, not all examples of acute inflammation show
infiltration by neutrophils. On the other hand, some chronic
inflammatory conditions are characterised by neutrophilic
infiltration. For example, typhoid fever is an example of acute
inflammatory process but the cellular response in it is
lymphocytic; osteomyelitis is an example of chronic
inflammation but the cellular response in this condition is
mainly neutrophilic.
The variation in inflammatory response depends upon a
number of factors and processes. These are discussed below:
1. Factors Involving the Organisms
i)
Type of injury and infection. For example, skin reacts
to herpes simplex infection by formation of vesicle and to
streptococcal infection by formation of boil; lung reacts to
pneumococci by occurrence of lobar pneumonia while to
tubercle bacilli it reacts by granulomatous inflammation.
ii) Virulence. Many species and strains of organisms may
have varying virulence e.g. the three strains of C. diphtheriae
(gravis, intermedius and mitis) produce the same diphtherial
exotoxin but in different amount.
iii) Dose. The concentration of organism in small doses
produces usually local lesions while larger dose results in
more severe spreading infections.
iv) Portal of entry. Some organisms are infective only if
administered by particular route e.g. Vibrio cholerae is not
pathogenic if injected subcutaneously but causes cholera if
swallowed.
v) Product of organisms. Some organisms produce enzymes
that help in spread of infections e.g. hyaluronidase by
Clostridium welchii, streptokinase by streptococci,
staphylokinase and coagulase by staphylococci.
2. Factors Involving the Host
i)
Systemic diseases. Certain acquired systemic diseases
in the host are associated with impaired inflammatory
response e.g. diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, cirrhosis
of the liver, chronic alcoholism, bone marrow suppression
from various causes (drugs, radiation, idiopathic). These
conditions render the host more susceptible to infections.
ii) Immune status of host. Patients who are immuno-
suppressed from congenital or acquired immunodeficiency
have lowered inflammatory response and spread of
infections occurs rapidly e.g. in AIDS, congenital immuno-
deficiency diseases, protein calorie malnutrition, starvation.
iii) Congenital neutrophil defects. Congenital defects in
neutrophil structure and functions result in reduced
inflammatory response.
iv) Leukopenia. Patients with low WBC count with
neutropenia or agranulocytosis develop spreading infection.
v) Site or type of tissue involved. For example, the lung
has loose texture as compared to bone and, thus, both tissues
react differently to acute inflammation.
vi) Local host factors. For instance, ischaemia, presence of
foreign bodies and chemicals cause necrosis and are thus
cause more harm.
3. Type of Exudation
The appearance of escaped plasma determines the morpho-
logic type of inflammation as under:
i)
Serous, when the fluid exudate resembles serum or is
watery e.g. pleural effusion in tuberculosis, blister formation
in burns.
ii) Fibrinous, when the fibrin content of the fluid exudate is
high e.g. in pneumococcal and rheumatic pericarditis.
iii) Purulent or suppurative exudate is formation of creamy
pus as seen in infection with pyogenic bacteria e.g. abscess,
acute appendicitis.
iv) Haemorrhagic, when there is vascular damage e.g. acute
haemorrhagic pneumonia in influenza.
v) Catarrhal, when the surface inflammation of epithelium
produces increased secretion of mucous e.g. common cold.
MORPHOLOGY OF ACUTE INFLAMMATION
Inflammation of an organ is usually named by adding the
suffix-itis to its Latin name e.g. appendicitis, hepatitis,
cholecystitis, meningitis etc. A few morphologic varieties of
acute inflammation are described below:
1.
PSEUDOMEMBRANOUS INFLAMMATION. It is
inflammatory response of mucous surface (oral, respiratory,
bowel) to toxins of diphtheria or irritant gases. As a result of
denudation of epithelium, plasma exudes on the surface
where it coagulates, and together with necrosed epithelium,
forms false membrane that gives this type of inflammation
its name.
2.
ULCER. Ulcers are local defects on the surface of an organ
produced by inflammation. Common sites for ulcerations are
the stomach, duodenum, intestinal ulcers in typhoid fever,
intestinal tuberculosis, bacillary and amoebic dysentery,
ulcers of legs due to varicose veins etc. In the acute stage,
there is infiltration by polymorphs with vasodilatation while
long-standing ulcers develop infiltration by lymphocytes,
plasma cells and macrophages with associated fibroblastic
proliferation and scarring.

145
CHAPTER 6
Inflammation and Healing
3.
SUPPURATION (ABSCESS FORMATION). When
acute bacterial infection is accompanied by intense
neutrophilic infiltrate in the inflamed tissue, it results in tissue
necrosis. A cavity is formed which is called an abscess and
contains purulent exudate or pus and the process of abscess
formation is known as suppuration. The bacteria which cause
suppuration are called pyogenic.
Microscopically, pus is creamy or opaque in appearance
and is composed of numerous dead as well as living
neutrophils, some red cells, fragments of tissue debris and
fibrin. In old pus, macrophages and cholesterol crystals
are also present (Fig. 6.15).
An abscess may be discharged to the surface due to
increased pressure inside or may require drainage by the
surgeon. Due to tissue destruction, resolution does not occur
but instead healing by fibrous scarring takes place.
Some of the common examples of abscess formation are
as under:
i)
Boil or furruncle which is an acute inflammation via hair
follicles in the dermal tissues.
ii) Carbuncle is seen in untreated diabetics and occurs as a
loculated abscess in the dermis and soft tissues of the neck.
4.
CELLULITIS. It is a diffuse inflammation of soft tissues
resulting from spreading effects of substances like
hyaluronidase released by some bacteria.
5.
BACTERIAL INFECTION OF THE BLOOD. This
includes the following 3 conditions:
i)
Bacteraemia is defined as presence of small number of
bacteria in the blood which do not multiply significantly.
They are commonly not detected by direct microscopy. Blood
culture is done for their detection e.g. infection with
Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus viridans.
ii) Septicaemia means presence of rapidly multiplying,
highly pathogenic bacteria in the blood e.g. pyogenic cocci,
bacilli of plague etc. Septicaemia is generally accompanied
by systemic effects like toxaemia, multiple small
haemorrhages, neutrophilic leucocytosis and disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC).
iii) Pyaemia is the dissemination of small septic thrombi in
the blood which cause their effects at the site where they are
lodged. This can result in pyaemic abscesses or septic infarcts.
a) Pyaemic abscesses are multiple small abscesses in various
organs such as in cerebral cortex, myocardium, lungs and
renal cortex, resulting from very small emboli fragmented
from septic thrombus. Microscopy of pyaemic abscess
shows a central zone of necrosis containing numerous
bacteria, surrounded by a zone of suppuration and an
outer zone of acute inflammatory cells (Fig. 6.16,A).
b) Septic infarcts result from lodgement of larger fragments
of septic thrombi in the arteries with relatively larger foci
of necrosis, suppuration and acute inflammation e.g.
septic infarcts of the lungs, liver, brain, and kidneys from
septic thrombi of leg veins or from acute bacterial
endocarditis (Fig. 6.16,B).
SYSTEMIC EFFECTS OF ACUTE INFLAMMATION
The account of acute inflammation given up to now above is
based on local tissue responses. However, acute
inflammation is associated with systemic effects as well.
These include fever, leucocytosis and lymphangitis-
lymphadenitis.
1.
Fever occurs due to bacteraemia. It is thought to be
mediated through release of factors like prostaglandins,
interleukin-1 and TNF-α in response to infection.
2.
Leucocytosis commonly accompanies the acute
inflammatory reactions, usually in the range of 15,000-
20,000/μl. When the counts are higher than this with ‘shift
to left’ of myeloid cells, the blood picture is described as
leukaemoid reaction. Usually, in bacterial infections there is
Figure 6.15
An abscess in the skin. It contains pus composed of necrotic tissue, debris, fibrin, RBCs and dead and living neutrophils. Some
macrophages are seen at the periphery.

146
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
neutrophilia; in viral infections lymphocytosis; and in
parasitic infestations, eosinophilia. Typhoid fever, an
example of acute inflammation, however, induces leucopenia
with relative lymphocytosis.
3.
Lymphangitis-lymphadenitis is one of the important
manifestations of localised inflammatory injury. The
lymphatics and lymph nodes that drain the inflamed
tissue show reactive inflammatory changes in the form
of lymphangitis and lymphadenitis. This response
represents either a nonspecific reaction to mediators
released from inflamed tissue or is an immunologic
response to a foreign antigen. The affected lymph nodes
may show hyperplasia of lymphoid follicles (follicular
hyperplasia) and proliferation of mononuclear phago-
cytic cells in the sinuses of lymph node (sinus histio-
cytosis) (Chapter 14).
4.
Shock may occur in severe cases. Massive release of
cytokine TNF-α, a mediator of inflammation, in response
to severe tissue injury or infection results in profuse
systemic vasodilatation, increased vascular permeability
and intravascular volume loss. The net effect of these
changes is hypotension and shock. Systemic activation of
coagulation pathway may occur leading to microthrombi
throughout the body and result in disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC), bleeding and death.
FATE OF ACUTE INFLAMMATION
The acute inflammatory process can culminate in one of the
following outcomes (Fig. 6.17):
1.
Resolution. It means complete return to normal tissue
following acute inflammation. This occurs when tissue
changes are slight and the cellular changes are reversible e.g.
resolution in lobar pneumonia.
2.
Healing. Healing by fibrosis takes place when the tissue
destruction in acute inflammation is extensive so that there
is no tissue regeneration. But when tissue loss is superficial,
it is restored by regeneration.
3.
Suppuration. When the pyogenic bacteria causing acute
inflammation result in severe tissue necrosis, the process
progresses to suppuration. Initially, there is intense neutro-
philic infiltration. Subsequently, mixture of neutrophils,
bacteria, fragments of necrotic tissue, cell debris and fibrin
comprise pus which is contained in a cavity to form an
abscess. The abscess, if not drained, may get organised by
dense fibrous tissue, and in time, get calcified.
4.
Chronic inflammation. Persisting or recurrent acute
inflammation may progress to chronic inflammation in which
the processes of inflammation and healing proceed side by
side.
Figure 6.16
Sequelae of pyaemia.

147
CHAPTER 6
Inflammation and Healing
CHRONIC INFLAMMATION
DEFINITION AND CAUSES. Chronic inflammation is
defined as prolonged process in which tissue destruction and
inflammation occur at the same time.
Chronic inflammation can be caused by one of the
following 3 ways:
1.
Chronic inflammation following acute inflammation.
When the tissue destruction is extensive, or the bacteria
survive and persist in small numbers at the site of acute
inflammation e.g. in osteomyelitis, pneumonia terminating
in lung abscess.
2.
Recurrent attacks of acute inflammation. When
repeated bouts of acute inflammation culminate in
chronicity of the process e.g. in recurrent urinary tract
infection leading to chronic pyelonephritis, repeated acute
infection of gallbladder leading to chronic cholecystitis.
3.
Chronic inflammation starting de novo. When the infec-
tion with organisms of low pathogenicity is chronic from the
beginning e.g. infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
GENERAL FEATURES OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATION
Though there may be differences in chronic inflammatory
response depending upon the tissue involved and causative
organisms, there are some basic similarities amongst various
types of chronic inflammation. Following general features
characterise any chronic inflammation:
1.
MONONUCLEAR CELL INFILTRATION. Chronic
inflammatory lesions are infiltrated by mononuclear
inflammatory cells like phagocytes and lymphoid cells.
Phagocytes are represented by circulating monocytes, tissue
macrophages, epithelioid cells and sometimes,
multinucleated giant cells. The macrophages comprise the
most important cells in chronic inflammation. These may
appear at the site of chronic inflammation from:
i)
chemotactic factors and adhesion molecules for continued
infiltration of macrophages;
ii) local proliferation of macrophages; and
iii) longer survival of macrophages at the site of inflam-
mation.
The blood monocytes on reaching the extravascular space
transform into tissue macrophages. Besides the role of
macrophages in phagocytosis, they may get activated in
response to stimuli such as cytokines (lymphokines) and
bacterial endotoxins. On activation, macrophages release
several biologically active substances e.g. acid and neutral
proteases, oxygen-derived reactive metabolites and
cytokines. These products bring about tissue destruction,
neovascularisation and fibrosis.
Other chronic inflammatory cells include lymphocytes,
plasma cells, eosinophils and mast cells. In chronic inflam-
mation, lymphocytes and macrophages influence each other
and release mediators of inflammation.
2.
TISSUE DESTRUCTION OR NECROSIS. Tissue
destruction and necrosis are central features of most forms
of chronic inflammatory lesions. This is brought about by
activated macrophages which release a variety of biologi-
cally active substances e.g. protease, elastase, collagenase,
lipase, reactive oxygen radicals, cytokines (IL-1, IL-8,
TNF-α), nitric oxide, angiogenesis growth factor etc.
3.
PROLIFERATIVE CHANGES. As a result of necrosis,
proliferation of small blood vessels and fibroblasts is
stimulated resulting in formation of inflammatory
granulation tissue. Eventually, healing by fibrosis and
collagen laying takes place.
SYSTEMIC EFFECTS OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATION
Chronic inflammation is associated with following systemic
features:
1.
Fever. Invariably there is mild fever, often with loss of
weight and weakness.
2. Anaemia. As discussed in Chapter 12, chronic inflam-
mation is accompanied by anaemia of varying degree.
3.
Leucocytosis. As in acute inflammation, chronic
inflammation also has leucocytosis but generally there is
relative lymphocytosis in these cases.
4.
ESR. ESR is elevated in all cases of chronic inflammation.
5.
Amyloidosis. Long-term cases of chronic suppurative
inflammation may develop secondary systemic (AA)
amyloidosis.
TYPES OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATION
Conventionally, chronic inflammation is subdivided into 2
types:
Figure 6.17
Fate of acute inflammation.

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
1.
Non-specific, when the irritant substance produces a non-
specific chronic inflammatory reaction with formation of
granulation tissue and healing by fibrosis e.g. chronic
osteomyelitis, chronic ulcer.
2.
Specific, when the injurious agent causes a characteri-
stic histologic tissue response e.g. tuberculosis, leprosy,
syphilis.
However, for a more descriptive classification, histo-
logical features are used for classifying chronic inflammation
into 2 corresponding types:
1.
Chronic non-specific inflammation. It is characterised
by non-specific inflammatory cell infiltration e.g. chronic
osteomyelitis, lung abscess. A variant of this type of chronic
inflammatory response is chronic suppurative inflammation
in which infiltration by polymorphs and abscess formation
are additional features e.g. actinomycosis.
2.
Chronic granulomatous inflammation. It is characterised
by formation of granulomas e.g. tuberculosis, leprosy,
syphilis, actinomycosis, sarcoidosis etc.
GRANULOMATOUS INFLAMMATION
Granuloma is defined as a circumscribed, tiny lesion, about
1 mm in diameter, composed predominantly of collection of
modified macrophages called epithelioid cells, and rimmed
at the periphery by lymphoid cells. The word ‘granuloma’ is
derived from granule meaning circumscribed granule-like
lesion, and -oma which is a suffix commonly used for true
tumours but here it indicates a localised inflammatory mass
or collection of macrophages.
PATHOGENESIS OF GRANULOMA. Formation of
granuloma is a type IV granulomatous hypersensitivity
reaction (page 77). It is a protective defense reaction by the
host but eventually causes tissue destruction because of
persistence of the poorly digestible antigen e.g. Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, M. leprae, suture material, particles of talc etc.
The sequence in evolution of granuloma is schematically
shown in Fig. 6.18 and is briefly outlined below:
1.
Engulfment by macrophages. Macrophages and
monocytes engulf the antigen and try to destroy it. But since
the antigen is poorly degradable, these cells fail to digest
and degrade the antigen, and instead undergo morphologic
changes to epithelioid cells.
2.
CD4+ T cells. Macrophages, being antigen-presenting
cells, having failed to deal with the antigen, present it to CD4+
T lymphocytes. These lymphocytes get activated and
elaborate lymphokines (IL-1, IL-2, interferon-γ, TNF-α).
3.
Cytokines. Various cytokines formed by activated CD4+
T cells and also by activated macrophages perform the
following roles:
i) IL-1 and IL-2 stimulate proliferation of more T cells.
ii) Interferon-γ activates macrophages.
iii) TNF-α promotes fibroblast proliferation and activates
endothelium to secrete prostaglandins which have role in
vascular response in inflammation.
iv) Growth factors (transforming growth factor-β, platelet-
derived growth factor) elaborated by activated macrophages
stimulate fibroblast growth.
Thus, a granuloma is formed of macrophages modified
as epithelioid cells in the centre, with some interspersed
multinucleate giant cells, surrounded peripherally by
lymphocytes (mainly T cells), and  healing by fibroblasts or
collagen depending upon the age of granuloma.
COMPOSITION OF GRANULOMA. In general, a
granuloma has the following structural composition:
1.
Epithelioid cells. These are so called because of their
epithelial cell-like appearance, are modified macrophages/
histiocytes which are somewhat elongated, having vesicular
and lightly-staining slipper-shaped nucleus, and pale-

CHAPTER 6
Inflammation and Healing
staining abundant cytoplasm with hazy outlines so that the
cell membrane of adjacent epithelioid cells is closely apposed.
Epithelioid cells are weakly phagocytic.
2.
Multinucleate giant cells. Multinucleate giant cells are
formed by fusion of adjacent epithelioid cells and may have
20 or more nuclei. These nuclei may be arranged at the
periphery like horseshoe or ring, or are clustered at the two
poles (Langhans’ giant cells), or they may be present centrally
(foreign body giant cells). The former are commonly seen in
tuberculosis while the latter are common in foreign body
tissue reactions. Like epithelioid cells, these giant cells are
weakly phagocytic but produce secretory products which
help in removing the invading agents.
3.
Lymphoid cells. As a cell mediated immune reaction to
antigen, the host response by lymphocytes is integral to
composition of a granuloma. Plasma cells indicative of
accelerated humoral immune response are present in some
types of granulomas.
4.
Necrosis. Necrosis may be a feature of some granulo-
matous conditions e.g. central caseation necrosis of
tuberculosis, so called because of cheese-like appearance and
consistency of necrosis.
5.
Fibrosis. Fibrosis is a feature of healing by proliferating
fibroblasts at the periphery of granuloma.
The classical example of granulomatous inflammation is
the tissue response to tubercle bacilli which is called tubercle
seen in tuberculosis (described below). A fully-developed
tubercle is about 1 mm in diameter with central area of
caseation necrosis, surrounded by epithelioid cells and one
to several multinucleated giant cells (commonly Langhans’
type), surrounded at the periphery by lymphocytes and
bounded by fibroblasts and fibrous tissue (Fig. 6.19).
EXAMPLES OF GRANULOMATOUS
INFLAMMATION
Granulomatous inflammation is typical of reaction to poorly
digestible agents elicited by tuberculosis, leprosy, fungal
infections, schistosomiasis, foreign particles etc. A
comprehensive list of important examples of granulomatous
conditions, their etiologic agents and salient features is given
in Table 6.4. The principal examples (marked with asterisk
in the table) are discussed below while a few others appear
in relevant Chapters later.
TUBERCULOSIS
Tissue response in tuberculosis represents classical example
of chronic granulomatous inflammation in humans.
CAUSATIVE ORGANISM. Tubercle bacillus or Koch’s
bacillus (named after discovery of the organism by Robert
Koch in 1882) called Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes
tuberculosis in the lungs and other tissues of the human body.
The organism is a strict aerobe and thrives best in tissues with
high oxygen tension such as in the apex of the lung.
Out of various pathogenic strains for human disease
included in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, currently
most common is M. tuberculosis hominis (human strain), while
M. tuberculosis bovis (bovine strain) used to be common
pathogen to human beings during the era of consumption of
unpasteurised milk but presently constitutes a small number
of human cases. Other less common strains included in the
complex are M. africanum (isolated from patients from parts
of Africa), M. microti, M. pinnipedii and M. canettii. A non-
pathogenic strain, M. smegmatis, is found in the smegma and
as contaminant in the urine of both men and women.
M. tuberculosis hominis is a slender rod-like bacillus,
0.5 μm by 3 μm, is neutral on Gram staining, and can be
demonstrated by the following methods:
1.
Acid fast (Ziehl-Neelsen) staining. The acid fastness of the
tubercle bacilli is due to mycolic acids, cross-linked fatty acids
and other lipids in the cell wall of the organism making it
impermeable to the usual stains. It takes up stain by heated
carbol fuchsin and resists decolourisation by acids and
alcohols (acid fast and alcohol fast) and can be decolourised
by 20% sulphuric acid (compared to 5% sulphuric acid for
declourisation for M. leprae which are less acid fast) (Fig. 6.20).
False positive AFB staining is seen due to Nocardia,
Rhodococcus, Legionella, and some protozoa such as Isospora
and Cryptosporidium.
2.
Fluorescent dye methods.
3.
Culture of the organism from sputum in Lowenstein-
Jensen (L.J.) medium for 6 weeks.
4.
Guinea pig inoculation method by subcutaneous injection
of the organisms.
5.
Molecular methods such as PCR are the most recent
methods.
ATYPICAL MYCOBACTERIA (NON-TUBERCULOUS
MYCOBACTERIA). The term atypical mycobacteria or non-
tuberculous mycobacteria is used for mycobacterial species

other than M. tuberculosis complex and M. leprae.  Non-
tuberculous mycobacteria are widely distributed in the
environment and are, therefore, also called as environmental
mycobacteria. They too are acid fast. Occasionally, human
tuberculosis may be caused by atypical mycobacteria which
are non-pathogenic to guinea pigs and resistant to usual anti-
tubercular drugs.
Conventionally, atypical mycobacteria are classified on
the basis of colour of colony produced in culture and the
speed of growth in media:
Rapid growers. These organisms grow fast on solid media
(within 7 days) but are less pathogenic than others. Examples
include M. abscessus, M.fortuitum, M. chelonae.

151
CHAPTER 6
Inflammation and Healing
Slow growers. These species grow mycobacteria on solid
media (in 2-3 weeks). Based on the colour of colony formed,
they are further divided into following:
Photochromogens: These organisms produce yellow pigment
in the culture grown in light.
Scotochromogens: Pigment is produced, whether the growth
is in light or in dark.
Non-chromogens: No pigment is produced by the bacilli and
the organism is closely related to avium bacillus.
The examples of slow growers are M. avium-intracellulare,
M. kansasii, M. ulcerans and M. fortuitum.
The infection by atypical mycobacteria is acquired
directly from the environment, unlike person-to-person
transmission of classical tuberculosis. They produce human
disease, atypical mycobacteriosis, similar to tuberculosis but
are much less virulent. The lesions produced may be
granulomas, nodular collection of foamy cells, or acute
inflammation.
Five patterns of the disease are recognised:
i)
Pulmonary disease produced by M. kansasii or M. avium-
intracellulare.
ii) Lymphadenitis caused by M. avium-intracellulare or M.
scrofulaceum.
iii) Ulcerated skin lesions produced by M. ulcerans or M.
marinum.
iv) Abscesses caused by M.fortuitum or M. chelonae.
v) Bacteraemias by M. avium-intracellulare as seen in
immunosuppressed patients of AIDS.
INCIDENCE. In spite of great advances in chemotherapy
and immunology, tuberculosis still continues to be
worldwide in distribution, more common in developing
countries of Africa, Latin America and Asia. Other factors
contributing to higher incidence of tuberculosis are
malnutrition, inadequate medical care, poverty, crowding,
chronic debilitating conditions like uncontrolled diabetes,
alcoholism and immunocompromised states like AIDS.
However, the exact incidence of disease cannot be
determined as all patients infected with M. tuberculosis may
not develop the clinical disease and many cases remain
reactive to tuberculin without developing symptomatic
disease.
HIV-ASSOCIATED TUBERCULOSIS. HIV-infected
individuals have very high incidence of tuberculosis all over
the world. Vice-versa, rate of HIV infection in patients of
tuberculosis is very high.  Moreover, HIV-infected individual
on acquiring infection with tubercle bacilli develops active
disease rapidly (within few weeks) rather than after months
or years. Pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV presents in typical
manner. However, it is more often sputum smear negative
but often culture positive. Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis is
more common in HIV disease and manifests commonly by
involving lymph nodes, pleura, pericardium, and
tuberculous meningitis. Infection with M. avium-intracellulare
(avian or bird strain) is common in patients with HIV/AIDS.
MODE OF TRANSMISSION. Human beings acquire
infection with tubercle bacilli by one of the following routes:
1.
Inhalation of organisms present in fresh cough droplets
or in dried sputum from an open case of pulmonary
tuberculosis.
2.
Ingestion of the organisms leads to development of tonsi-
llar or intestinal tuberculosis. This mode of infection of
human tubercle bacilli is from self-swallowing of infected
sputum of an open case of pulmonary tuberculosis, or
ingestion of bovine tubercle bacilli from milk of diseased
cows.
3.
Inoculation of the organisms into the skin may rarely occur
from infected postmortem tissue.
4.
Transplacental route results in development of congenital
tuberculosis in foetus from infected mother and is a rare mode
of transmission.
SPREAD OF TUBERCULOSIS. The disease spreads in the
body by various routes:
1.
Local spread. This takes place by macrophages carrying
the bacilli into the surrounding tissues.
2.
Lymphatic spread. Tuberculosis is primarily an infection
of lymphoid tissues. The bacilli may pass into lymphoid
follicles of pharynx, bronchi, intestines or regional lymph
nodes resulting in regional tuberculous lymphadenitis which
is typical of childhood infections. Primary complex is primary
focus with lymphangitis and lymphadenitis.
3.
Haematogenous spread. This occurs either as a result of
tuberculous bacillaemia because of the drainage of
lymphatics into the venous system or due to caseous mate-
rial escaping through ulcerated wall of a vein. This produces
millet seed-sized lesions in different organs of the body like
lungs, liver, kidneys, bones and other tissues and is known
as miliary tuberculosis.
4.
By the natural passages. Infection may spread from:
i)
lung lesions into pleura (tuberculous pleurisy);
ii) transbronchial spread into the adjacent lung segments;
Figure 6.20

acid-fast bacilli in Ziehl-Neelsen staining.

152
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
iii) tuberculous salpingitis into peritoneal cavity (tuberculous
peritonitis);
iv) infected sputum into larynx (tuberculous laryngitis);
v) swallowing of infected sputum (ileocaecal tuberculosis);
and
vi) renal lesions into ureter and down to trigone of bladder.
HYPERSENSITIVITY AND IMMUNITY IN TUBER-
CULOSIS. Hypersensitivity or allergy, and immunity or
resistance, play a major role in the development of lesions in
tuberculosis. Tubercle bacilli as such do not produce any
toxins. Tissue changes seen in tuberculosis are not the result
of any exotoxin or endotoxin but are instead the result of
host response to the organism which is in the form of
development of cell-mediated hypersensitivity (or type IV
hypersensitivity) and immunity. Both these host responses
develop as a consequence of several lipids present in the
microorganism which include the following:
1.
mycosides such as ‘cord factor’ which are essential for
growth and virulence of the organism in the animals; and
2.
glycolipids present in the mycobacterial cell wall like
‘Wax-D’ which acts as an adjuvant acting along with
tuberculoprotein.
It has been known since the time of Robert Koch that the
tissue reaction to tubercle bacilli is different in healthy animal
not previously infected (primary infection) from an animal
who is previously infected (secondary infection).
1.
In the primary infection, intradermal injection of tubercle
bacilli into the skin of a healthy guinea pig evokes no visible
reaction for 10-14 days. After this period, a nodule develops
at the inoculation site which subsequently ulcerates and heals
poorly as the guinea pig, unlike human beings, does not
possess any natural resistance. The regional lymph nodes
also develop tubercles. This process is a manifestation of
delayed type of hypersensitivity (type IV reaction) and is
comparable to primary tuberculosis in children although
healing invariably occurs in children.
2.
In the secondary infection, the sequence of changes is
different. The tubercle bacilli are injected into the skin of the
guinea pig who has been infected with tuberculosis 4-6 weeks
earlier. In 1-2 days, the site of inoculation is indurated and
dark, attaining a diameter of about 1 cm. The skin lesion
ulcerates which heals quickly and the regional lymph nodes
are not affected. This is called Koch’s phenomenon and is
indicative of hypersensitivity and immunity in the host.
Similar type of changes can be produced if injection of
live tubercle bacilli is replaced with old tuberculin (OT).
Hypersensitivity and immunity are closely related and
are initiated through CD4+ T lymphocytes sensitised against
specific antigens in tuberculin. As a result of this sensitisation,
lymphokines are released from T cells which induce
increased microbicidal activity of the macrophages.
Tuberculin (Mantoux) skin test. This test is done by
intradermal injection of 0.1 ml of tuberculoprotein, purified
protein derivative (PPD). Delayed type of hypersensitivity
develops in individuals who are having or have been
previously infected with tuberculous infection which is
identified as an indurated area of more than 15 mm in 72
hours. However, patients having disseminated tuberculosis
may show negative test due to release of large amount of
tuberculoproteins from the endogenous lesions masking the
hypersensitivity test. A positive test is indicative of cell-
mediated hypersensitivity to tubercular antigens but does
not distinguish between infection and disease. The test may
be false positive in atypical mycobacterial infection and false
negative in sarcoidosis, some viral infections, Hodgkin’s
disease and fulminant tuberculosis.
Immunisation against tuberculosis. Protective immuni-
sation against tuberculosis is induced by injection of
attenuated strains of bovine type of tubercle bacilli, Bacille
Calmette-Guérin (BCG). Cell-mediated immunity with
consequent delayed hypersensitivity reaction develops with
healing of the lesion, but the cell-mediated immunity persists,
rendering the host tuberculin-positive and hence immune.
EVOLUTION OF TUBERCLE. The sequence of events which
take place when tubercle bacilli are introduced into the tissue
are as under (Fig. 6.21):
1.
When the tubercle bacilli are injected intravenously
into the guinea pig, the bacilli are lodged in pulmonary

153
CHAPTER 6
Inflammation and Healing
capillaries where an initial response of neutrophils is evoked
which are rapidly destroyed by the organisms.
2.
After about 12 hours, there is progressive infiltration by
macrophages. This is due to coating of tubercle bacilli with
serum complement factors C2a and C3b which act as
opsonins and attract the macrophages. Macrophages
dominate the picture throughout the remaining life of the
lesions. If the tubercle bacilli are, however, inhaled into the
lung alveoli, macrophages predominate the picture from the
beginning.
3.
The macrophages start phagocytosing the tubercle bacilli
and either kill the bacteria or die away themselves. In the
latter case, they further proliferate locally as well as there is
increased recruitment of macrophages from blood
monocytes.
4.
As a part of body’s immune response, T and B cells are
activated.  Activated CD4+T cells develop the cell-mediated
delayed type hypersensitivity reaction, while B cells result in
formation of antibodies which play no role in body’s defence
against tubercle bacilli.
5.
In 2-3 days, the macrophages undergo structural changes
as a result of immune mechanisms—the cytoplasm becomes
pale and eosinophilic and their nuclei become elongated and
vesicular. These modified macrophages resemble epithelial
cells and are called epithelioid cells.
6. The epithelioid cells in time aggregate into tight clusters
or granulomas. Release of cytokines in response to sensitised
CD4+T cells and some constituents of mycobacterial cell wall
play a role in formation of granuloma.
7.
Some of the macrophages form multinucleated giant cells
by fusion of adjacent cells. The giant cells may be Langhans’
type having peripherally arranged nuclei in the form of
horseshoe or ring, or clustered at the two poles of the giant
cell; or they may be foreign body type having centrally-placed
nuclei.
8.
Around the mass of epithelioid cells and giant cells is a
zone of lymphocytes, plasma cells and fibroblasts. The lesion
at this stage is called hard tubercle due to absence of central
necrosis.
9.
Within 10-14 days, the centre of the cellular mass begins
to undergo caseation necrosis, characterised by cheesy
appearance and high lipid content. This stage is called soft
tubercle which is the hallmark of tuberculous lesions. The
development of caseation necrosis is possibly due to
interaction of mycobacteria with activated T cells (CD4+
helper T cells via IFN-γ and CD8+ suppressor T cells directly)
as well as by direct toxicity of mycobacteria on macrophages.
Microscopically, caseation necrosis is structureless,
eosinophilic and granular material with nuclear debris.
10. The soft tubercle which is a fully-developed granuloma
with caseous centre does not favour rapid proliferation of
tubercle bacilli. Acid-fast bacilli are difficult to find in these
lesions and may be demonstrated at the margins of recent
necrotic foci and in the walls of the cavities.
The fate of a granuloma is variable:
i)
The caseous material may undergo liquefaction and
extend into surrounding soft tissues, discharging the contents
on the surface. This is called cold abscess although there are
no pus cells in it.
ii) In tuberculosis of tissues like bones, joints, lymph nodes
and epididymis, sinuses are formed and the sinus tracts are
lined by tuberculous granulation tissue.
iii) The adjacent granulomas may coalesce together enlarging
the lesion which is surrounded by progressive fibrosis.
iv) In the granuloma enclosed by fibrous tissue, calcium salts
may get deposited in the caseous material (dystrophic
calcification) and sometimes the lesion may even get ossified
over the years.
TYPES OF TUBERCULOSIS
Lung is the main organ affected in tuberculosis. Depending
upon the type of tissue response and age, the infection with
tubercle bacilli is of 2 main types:
A. Primary tuberculosis; and
B. Secondary tuberculosis.
A. Primary Tuberculosis
The infection of an individual who has not been previously
infected or immunised is called primary tuberculosis or Ghon’s
complex or childhood tuberculosis.
Primary complex or Ghon’s complex is the lesion
produced in the tissue of portal of entry with foci in the
draining lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes. The most
commonly involved tissues for primary complex are lungs
and hilar lymph nodes. Other tissues which may show
primary complex are tonsils and cervical lymph nodes, and
in the case of ingested bacilli the lesions may be found in
small intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes.
The incidence of disseminated form of progressive
primary tuberculosis is particularly high in immunocompro-
mised host e.g. in patients of AIDS.
Primary complex or Ghon’s complex in lungs consists of 3
components (Fig. 6.22):
1.
Pulmonary component. Lesion in the lung is the primary
focus or Ghon’s focus. It is 1-2 cm solitary area of tuberculous
Figure 6.22
The primary complex composed of 3 components:
Ghon’s focus, draining lymphatics, and hilar lymph nodes.

154
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
pneumonia located peripherally under a patch of pleurisy,
in any part of the lung but more often in subpleural focus in
the upper part of lower lobe.
Microscopically, the lung lesion consists of tuberculous
granulomas with caseation necrosis.
2.
Lymphatic vessel component. The lymphatics draining
the lung lesion contain phagocytes containing bacilli and may
develop beaded, miliary tubercles along the path of hilar
lymph nodes.
3.
Lymph node component. This consists of enlarged hilar
and tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes in the area drained. The
affected lymph nodes are matted and show caseation necrosis
(Fig. 6.23, A).
Microscopically, the lesions are characterised by extensive
caseation, tuberculous granulomas and fibrosis.
Nodal lesions are potential source of re-infection later
(Fig. 6.23, B).
In the case of primary tuberculosis of the alimentary tract
due to ingestion of tubercle bacilli, a small primary focus is
seen in the intestine with enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes
producing tabes mesenterica. The enlarged and caseous
mesenteric lymph nodes may rupture into peritoneal cavity
and cause tuberculous peritonitis.
FATE OF PRIMARY TUBERCULOSIS. Primary complex
may have one of the following sequelae (Fig. 6.24):
1.
The lesions of primary tuberculosis of lung commonly
do not progress but instead heal by fibrosis, and in time
undergo calcification and even ossification.
2.
In some cases, the primary focus in the lung continues to
grow and the caseous material is disseminated through

155
CHAPTER 6
Inflammation and Healing
bronchi to the other parts of the same lung or the opposite
lung. This is called progressive primary tuberculosis.
3.
At times, bacilli may enter the circulation through erosion
in a blood vessel and spread to various tissues and organs.
This is called primary miliary tuberculosis and the lesions are
seen in organs like the liver, spleen, kidney, brain and bone
marrow.
4.
In certain circumstances like in lowered resistance and
increased hypersensitivity of the host, the healed lesions of
primary tuberculosis may get reactivated. The bacilli lying
dormant in acellular caseous material are activated and cause
progressive secondary tuberculosis. It affects children more
commonly but adults may also develop this kind of
progression.
B. Secondary Tuberculosis
The infection of an individual who has been previously
infected or sensitised is called secondary, or post-primary or
reinfection, or chronic tuberculosis.
The infection may be acquired from (Fig. 6.25):
endogenous source such as reactivation of dormant primary
complex; or
exogenous source such as fresh dose of reinfection by the
tubercle bacilli.
Secondary tuberculosis occurs most commonly in lungs
in the region of apex. Other sites and tissues which can be
involved are tonsils, pharynx, larynx, small intestine and
skin. Secondary tuberculosis of other organs and tissues is
described in relevant chapters later while that of lungs is
discussed here.
Secondary Pulmonary Tuberculosis
The lesions in secondary pulmonary tuberculosis usually
begin as 1-2 cm apical area of consolidation of the lung, which
may in time develop a small area of central caseation necrosis
and peripheral fibrosis. It occurs by haematogenous spread
of infection from primary complex to the apex of the affected
lung where the oxygen tension is high and favourable for
growth of aerobic tubercle bacilli. Microscopically, the appear-
ance is typical of tuberculous granulomas with caseation
necrosis.
Patients with HIV infection previously exposed to
tuberculous infection have particularly high incidence of
reactivation of primary tuberculosis and the pattern of lesions
in such cases is similar to that of primary tuberculosis i.e.
with involvement of hilar lymph nodes rather than cavitary
and apical lesions in the lung. In addition, infection with M.
avium-intracellulare occurs more frequently in cases of AIDS.
FATE OF SECONDARY PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS.
The subapical lesions in lungs can have the following courses:
1.
The lesions may heal with fibrous scarring and
calcification.
2.
The lesions may coalesce together to form larger area of
tuberculous pneumonia and produce progressive secondary
pulmonary tuberculosis with the following pulmonary and
extrapulmonary involvements:
i)
Fibrocaseous tuberculosis
ii) Tuberculous caseous pneumonia
iii) Miliary tuberculosis.
I.
FIBROCASEOUS TUBERCULOSIS. The original area
of tuberculous pneumonia undergoes massive central
caseation necrosis which may:
either break into a bronchus from a cavity (cavitary or open
fibrocaseous tuberculosis); or
remain, as a soft caseous lesion without drainage into a
bronchus or bronchiole to produce a non-cavitary lesion
(chronic fibrocaseous tuberculosis).
The cavity provides favourable environment for
proliferation of tubercle bacilli due to high oxygen tension.
The cavity may communicate with bronchial tree and
becomes the source of spread of infection (‘open tuberculosis’).
The open case of secondary tuberculosis may implant
tuberculous lesion on the mucosal lining of air passages
producing endobronchial and endotracheal tuberculosis.
Ingestion of sputum containing tubercle bacilli from
endogenous pulmonary lesions may produce laryngeal and
intestinal tuberculosis.
Grossly, tuberculous cavity is spherical with thick fibrous
wall, lined by yellowish, caseous, necrotic material and
the lumen is traversed by thrombosed blood vessels.
Around the wall of cavity are seen foci of consolidation.
The overlying pleura may also be thickened (Fig. 6.26).
Microscopically, the wall of cavity shows eosinophilic,
granular, caseous material which may show foci of
dystrophic calcification. Widespread coalesced
tuberculous granulomas composed of epithelioid cells,
Langhans’ giant cells and peripheral mantle of
lymphocytes and having central caseation necrosis are
seen. The outer wall of cavity shows fibrosis (Fig. 6.27).
Complications of cavitary secondary tuberculosis are as
follows:
a) Aneurysms of patent arteries crossing the cavity
producing haemoptysis.
b) Extension to pleura producing bronchopleural fistula.

infection from reactivation of dormant primary complex. B, Exogenous
infection from fresh dose of tubercle bacilli.

into pulmonary artery restricting the development of miliary
lesions within the lung (Fig. 6.29). The miliary lesions are
millet seed-sized (1 mm diameter), yellowish, firm areas
without grossly visible caseation necrosis.
Microscopically, the lesions show the structure of tuber-
cles with minute areas of caseation necrosis (Fig. 6.30).
Clinical Features and Diagnosis of Tuberculosis
The clinical manifestations in tuberculosis may be variable
depending upon the location, extent and type of lesions.
However, in secondary pulmonary tuberculosis which is the
common type, the usual clinical features are as under:
1.
Referable to lungs—such as productive cough, may be
with haemoptysis, pleural effusion, dyspnoea, orthopnoea
etc. Chest X-ray may show typical apical changes like pleural
effusion, nodularity, and miliary or diffuse infiltrates in the
lung parenchyma.
2.
Systemic features—such as fever, night sweats, fatigue,
loss of weight and appetite. Long-standing and untreated

parenchyma surrounding the cavity.

material on the pleural surface.
d) Thickened pleura from adhesions of parietal pleura.
II. TUBERCULOUS CASEOUS PNEUMONIA. The
caseous material from a case of secondary tuberculosis in an
individual with high degree of hypersensitivity may spread
to rest of the lung producing caseous pneumonia
(Fig. 6.28, A).
Microscopically, the lesions show exudative reaction with
oedema, fibrin, polymorphs and monocytes but numerous
tubercle bacilli can be demonstrated in the exudates
(Fig. 6.28,B).
III. MILIARY TUBERCULOSIS. This is lymphohaemato-
genous spread of tuberculous infection from primary focus
or later stages of tuberculosis. The spread may occur to
systemic organs or isolated organ. The spread is either by
entry of infection into pulmonary vein producing dissemi-
nated or isolated organ lesion in different extra-pulmonary
sites (e.g. liver, spleen, kidney, brain and bone marrow) or

157

cases of tuberculosis may develop systemic secondary
amyloidosis.
The diagnosis is made by the following tests:
i)
Positive Mantoux skin test.
ii) Positive sputum for AFB (on smear or culture).
iii) Complete haemogram  (lymphocytosis and raised ERR).
iv) Chest X-ray (characteristic hilar nodules and other
parenchymal changes).
v) Fine needle aspiration cytology of an enlarged peripheral
lymph node is quite helpful for confirmation of diagnosis
(page 282).
Causes of death in pulmonary tuberculosis are usually
pulmonary insufficiency, pulmonary haemorrhage, sepsis
due to disseminated miliary tuberculosis, cor pulmonale or
secondary amyloidosis.

these cases have numerous acid-fast bacilli (not shown here).

LEPROSY
Leprosy or Hansen’s disease (after discovery of the causa-
tive organism by Hansen in 1874), was first described in
ancient Indian text going back to 6th Century BC, is a
chronic non-fatal infectious disease affecting mainly the
cooler parts of the body such as the skin, mouth, respiratory
tract, eyes, peripheral nerves, superficial lymph nodes and
testis. Though the earliest and main involvement in leprosy
is of the skin and nerves but in bacteraemia from endothelial
colonisation or by bacilli filtered from blood by reticulo-
endothelial system, other organs such as the liver, spleen,
bone marrow and regional lymph nodes are also involved.
Advanced cases may develop secondary amyloidosis and
renal disease, both of which are of immunologic origin.
Causative Organism
The disease is caused by Mycobacterium leprae which closely
resembles Mycobacterium tuberculosis but is less acid-fast. The
organisms in tissues appear as compact rounded masses
(globi) or are arranged in parallel fashion like cigarettes-in-
pack.
M. leprae can be demonstrated in tissue sections, in split
skin smears by splitting the skin, scrapings from cut edges
of dermis, and in nasal smears by the following techniques:
1.
Acid-fast (Ziehl-Neelsen) staining. The staining procedure
is similar as for demonstration of M. tuberculosis but can be
decolourised by lower concentration (5%) of sulphuric acid
(less acid-fast) (Fig. 6.31).
2.
Fite-Faraco staining procedure is a modification of Z.N.
procedure and is considered better for more adequate
staining of tissue sections.
3.
Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) staining can also be
employed.
4. Molecular methods by PCR.
5. IgM antibodies to PGL-1 antigen seen in 95% cases of
lepromatous leprosy but only in 60% cases of tuberculoid
leprosy.

158
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
The slit smear technique gives a reasonable quantitative
measure of M. leprae when stained with Ziehl-Neelsen
method and examined under 100x oil objective for
determining the density of bacteria in the lesion (bacterial
index, BI). B.I. is scored from 1+ to 6+ (range from 1 to 10
bacilli per 100 fields to > 1000 per field) as multibacillary
leprosy while B.I. of 0+ is termed paucibacillary.
Although lepra bacilli were the first bacteria identified
for causing human disease, M. leprae remains one of the few
bacterial species which is yet to be cultured on artificial
medium. Nine-banded armadillo, a rodent, acts as an experi-
mental animal model as it develops leprosy which is
histopathologically and immunologically similar to human
leprosy.
Incidence
The disease is endemic in areas with hot and moist climates
and in poor tropical countries. According to the WHO,
8 countries—India, China, Nepal, Brazil, Indonesia,
Myanmar (Burma), Madagascar and Nigeria, together
constitute about 80% of leprosy cases, of which India
accounts for one-third of all registered leprosy cases globally.
In India, the disease is seen more commonly in regions like
Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Pondicherry, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa,
West Bengal and Assam. Very few cases are now seen in
Europe and the United States.
Mode of Transmission
Leprosy is a slow communicable disease and the incubation
period between first exposure and appearance of signs of
disease varies from 2 to 20 years (average about 3 years).
The infectivity may be from the following sources:
1.
Direct contact with untreated leprosy patients who shed
numerous bacilli from damaged skin, nasal secretions,
mucous membrane of mouth and hair follicles.
2.
Materno-foetal transmission across the placenta.
3.
Transmission from milk of leprosy patient to infant.
Immunology of Leprosy
Like in tuberculosis, the immune response in leprosy is also
T cell-mediated delayed hypersensitivity (type IV reaction)
but the two diseases are quite dissimilar as regards immune
reactions and lesions. M. leprae do not produce any toxins
but instead the damage to tissues is immune-mediated. This
is due to following peculiar aspects in immunology of
leprosy:
1. Antigens of leprosy bacilli. Lepra bacilli have several
antigens. The bacterial cell wall contains large amount of M.
leprae-specific phenolic glycolipid (PGL-1) and another
surface antigen, lipo-arabinomannan (LAMN). These
antigens of the bacilli determine the immune reaction of host
lymphocytes and macrophages. Another unique feature of
leprosy bacilli is invasion in peripheral nerves which is due
to binding of trisaccharide of M. leprae to basal lamina of
Schwann cells.
2. Genotype of the host. Genetic composition of the host as
known by MHC class (or HLA type) determines which

and cigarettes-in-a-pack appearance inside the foam macrophages.

159
CHAPTER 6
Inflammation and Healing
antigen of leprosy bacilli shall interact with host immune
cells. Accordingly, the host response to the leprosy bacilli in
different individuals is variable.
3. T cell response. There is variation in T cell response in
different individuals infected with leprosy bacilli:
i) Unlike tubercle bacilli, there is not only activation of CD4+
T cells but also of CD8+ T cells.
ii) CD4+ T cells in lepra bacilli infected persons act not only
as helper and promoter cells but also assume the role of
cytotoxicity.
iii) The two subpopulations of CD4+ T cells (or T helper
cells)—TH 1 cells and TH 2 cells, elaborate different types of
cytokines in response to stimuli from the lepra bacilli and
macrophages.
iv) In tuberculoid leprosy, the response is largely by CD4+ T
cells, while in lepromatous leprosy although there is excess
of CD8+ T cells (suppressor T) but the macrophages and
suppressor T cells fail to destroy the bacilli due to CD8+ T
cell defect.
4. Humoral response. Though the patients of lepromatous
leprosy have humoral components like high levels of
immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM) and antibodies to
mycobacterial antigens but these antibodies do not have any
protective role against  lepra bacilli.
Based on above unique immunologic features in leprosy,
lesions in leprosy are classified into 5 distinct clinico-
pathologic types and three forms of reactional leprosy which
are described below), and an intradermal immunologic test,
lepromin test.
LEPROMIN TEST. It is not a diagnostic test but is used for
classifying leprosy on the basis of immune response. Intra-
dermal injection of lepromin, an antigenic extract of M. leprae,
reveals delayed hypersensitivity reaction in patients of
tuberculoid leprosy:
An early positive reaction appearing as an indurated area
in 24-48 hours is called Fernandez reaction.
A delayed granulomatous lesion appearing after 3-4
weeks is called Mitsuda reaction.
Patients of lepromatous leprosy are negative by the
lepromin test.
The test indicates that cell-mediated immunity is greatly
suppressed in lepromatous leprosy while patients of
tuberculoid leprosy show good immune response. Delayed
type of hypersensitivity is conferred by T helper cells. The
granulomas of tuberculoid leprosy have sufficient T helper
cells and fewer T suppressor cells at the periphery while the
cellular infiltrates of lepromatous leprosy lack T helper cells.
Classification
Leprosy is broadly classified into 2 main types:
Lepromatous type representing low resistance; and
Tuberculoid type representing high resistance.
Salient differences between the two main forms of lep-
rosy are summarised in Table 6.5.
Since both these types of leprosy represent two opposite
poles of host immune response, these are also called polar
forms of leprosy. Cases not falling into either of the two poles
are classified as borderline and indeterminate types.
Leprosy is classified into 5 clinico-pathologic groups
(modified Ridley and Jopling’s classification) as under:
TT—Tuberculoid Polar (High resistance)
BT—Borderline Tuberculoid
BB—Mid Borderline (dimorphic)
BL—Borderline Lepromatous
LL—Lepromatous Polar (Low resistance)
In addition, not included in Ridley-Jopling’s classifica-
tion are cases of indeterminate leprosy, pure neural leprosy,
and histoid leprosy resembling a nodule of dermatofibroma
and positive for lepra bacilli.
Reactional Leprosy
There may be two types of lepra reactions: type I (reversal
reactions), and type II (erythema nodosum leprosum).
TYPE I: REVERSAL REACTIONS. The polar forms of
leprosy do not undergo any change in clinical and histo-
pathological picture. The borderline groups are unstable and
may move across the spectrum in either direction with
upgrading or downgrading of patient’s immune state.
Accordingly, there may be two types of borderline reaction:

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
1.
Upgrading reaction is characterised by increased cell-
mediated immunity and occurs in patients of borderline
lepromatous (BL) type on treatment who upgrade or shift
towards tuberculoid type.
Histologically, the upgrading reaction shows an increase
of lymphocytes, oedema of the lesions, necrosis in the
centre and reduced B.I.
2.
Downgrading reaction is characterised by lowering of
cellular immunity and is seen in borderline tuberculoid (BT)
type who downgrade or shift towards lepromatous type.
Histologically, the lesions show dispersal and spread of
the granulomas and increased presence of lepra bacilli.
TYPE II: ERYTHEMA NODOSUM LEPROSUM (ENL).
ENL occurs in lepromatous patients after treatment. It is
characterised by tender cutaneous nodules, fever,
iridocyclitis, synovitis and lymph node involvement.
Histologically, the lesions in ENL show infiltration by
neutrophils and eosinophils and prominence of vasculitis.
Inflammation often extends deep into the subcutaneous
fat causing panniculitis. Bacillary load is increased.
Secondary amyloidosis may follow repeated attacks of
ENL in leprosy.
Histopathology of Leprosy
Usually, skin biopsy from the margin of lesions is submitted
for diagnosis and for classification of leprosy. The
histopathologic diagnosis of multibacillary leprosy like LL
and BL offers no problem while the indeterminate leprosy
and tuberculoid lesions are paucibacillary and their diagnosis
is made together with clinical evidence.
In general, for histopathologic evaluation in all suspected
cases of leprosy the following broad guidelines should be
followed:
cell type of granuloma;
nerve involvement; and
bacterial load.
The main features in various groups are given below.
1.
Lepromatous leprosy:
The following features characterise lepromatous polar
leprosy (Fig. 6.32):
i)
In the dermis, there is proliferation of macrophages
with foamy change, particularly around the blood vessels,
nerves and dermal appendages. The foamy macrophages
are called ‘lepra cells’ or Virchow cells.
ii) The lepra cells are heavily laden with acid-fast bacilli
demonstrated with AFB staining. The AFB may be seen
as compact globular masses (globi) or arranged in parallel
fashion like ‘cigarettes-in-pack’ (see Fig. 6.31).
iii) The dermal infiltrate of lepra cells characteristically
does not encroach upon the basal layer of epidermis and
is separated from epidermis by a subepidermal
uninvolved clear zone.
iv) The epidermis overlying the lesions is thinned out, flat
and may even ulcerate.
2.
Tuberculoid leprosy:
The polar tuberculoid form presents the following
histological features (Fig. 6.33):
i)
The dermal lesions show granulomas resembling hard
tubercles composed of epithelioid cells, Langhans’ giant
cells and peripheral mantle of lymphocytes.
ii) Lesions of tuberculoid leprosy have predilection for
dermal nerves which may be destroyed and infiltrated by
epithelioid cells and lymphocytes.
iii) The granulomatous infiltrate erodes the basal layer of
epidermis i.e. there is no clear zone.
iv) The lepra bacilli are few and seen in destroyed nerves.
3.
Borderline leprosy:
The histopathologic features of the three forms of
borderline leprosy are as under:
i)
Borderline tuberculoid (BT) form shows epithelioid cells
and plentiful lymphocytes. There is a narrow clear
subepidermal zone. Lepra bacilli are scanty and found in
nerves.
Figure 6.32
Lepromatous leprosy (LL). There is collection of proliferating foam macrophages (lepra cells) in the dermis with a clear subepidermal
zone.

161
CHAPTER 6
Inflammation and Healing
ii) Borderline lepromatous (BL) form shows predominance
of histiocytes, a few epithelioid cells and some irregularly
dispersed lymphocytes. Numerous lepra bacilli are seen.
iii) Mid-borderline (BB) or dimorphic form shows sheets
of epithelioid cells with no giant cells. Some lymphocytes
are seen in the peri-neurium. Lepra bacilli are present,
mostly in nerves.
4.
Indeterminate leprosy:
The histopathologic features are non-specific so that the
diagnosis of non-specific chronic dermatitis may be made.
However, a few features help in suspecting leprosy as
under:
i)
Lymphocytic or mononuclear cell infiltrate, focalised
particularly around skin adnexal structures like hair
follicles and sweat glands or around blood vessels.
ii) Nerve involvement, if present, is strongly supportive
of diagnosis.
iii) Confirmation of diagnosis is made by finding of lepra
bacilli.
Clinical Features
The two main forms of leprosy show distinctive clinical
features:
1.
Lepromatous leprosy:
i)
The skin lesions in LL are generally symmetrical,
multiple, slightly hypopigmented and erythematous
macules, papules, nodules or diffuse infiltrates. The nodular
lesions may coalesce to give leonine facies appearance.
ii) The lesions are hypoaesthetic or anaesthetic but the
sensory disturbance is not as distinct as in TT.
2.
Tuberculoid leprosy:
i)
The skin lesions in TT occur as either single or as a few
asymmetrical lesions which are hypopigmented and
erythematous macules.
ii) There is a distinct sensory impairment.
Anti-leprosy vaccines have been developed and are
undergoing human trials but since the incubation period of
leprosy is quite long, the efficacy of such vaccines will be
known after a number of years.
SYPHILIS
Syphilis is a venereal (sexually-transmitted) disease caused
by spirochaetes, Treponema pallidum. Other treponemal
diseases are yaws, pinta and bejel. The word ‘syphilis’ is
derived from the name of the mythological handsome boy,
Syphilus, who was cursed by Greek god Apollo with the
disease.
Causative Organism
T. pallidum is a coiled spiral filament 10 μm long that moves
actively in fresh preparations. The organism cannot be
stained by the usual methods and can be demonstrated in
the exudates and tissues by:
1.
dark ground illumination (DGI) in fresh preparation;
2.
fluorescent antibody technique;
3.
silver impregnation techniques; and
4. PCR as a research method.
The organism has not been cultivated in any culture
media but experimental infection can be produced in rabbits
and chimpanzees. The organism is rapidly destroyed by cold,
heat, and antiseptics.
Immunology
T. pallidum does not produce any endotoxin or exotoxin. The
pathogenesis of the lesions appears to be due to host immune
response.
There are two types of serological tests for syphilis:
treponemal and non-treponemal.
A. Treponemal serological tests: These tests measure
antibody to T. pallidum antigen and are as under:
i)
Fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorbed (FTA-ABS) test.

162
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
ii) Agglutinin assays e.g. microhaemagglutination assay for
T. pallidum (MHA-TP), and Serodia TP-PA which is more
sensitive.
iii) T. pallidum passive haemagglutination (TPHA) test.
B. Non-treponemal serological tests. These tests measure
non-specific reaginic antibodies IgM and IgG immuno-
globulins directed against cardiolipin-lecithin-cholesterol
complex and are more commonly used. These tests are as
under:
i) Reiter protein complement fixation (RPCF) test: test of choice
for rapid diagnosis.
ii) Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test:
Wassermann described a complement fixing antibody
against antigen of human syphilitic tissue. This antigen is
used in the Standard Test for Syphilis (STS) in Wassermann
complement fixing test and Venereal Disease Research
Laboratory (VDRL) test.
Mode of Transmission
Syphilitic infection can be transmitted by the following
routes:
1.
Sexual intercourse resulting in lesions on glans penis,
vulva, vagina and cervix.
2.
Intimate person-to-person contact with lesions on lips,
tongue or fingers.
3.
Transfusion of infected blood.
4.
Materno-foetal transmission in congenital syphilis if the
mother is infected.
Stages of Acquired Syphilis
Acquired syphilis is divided into 3 stages depending upon
the period after which the lesions appear and the type of
lesions. These are: primary, secondary and tertiary syphilis.
1.
PRIMARY SYPHILIS. Typical lesion of primary syphilis
is chancre which appears on genitals or at extra-genital sites
in 2-4 weeks after exposure to infection (Fig. 6.34,A). Initially,
the lesion is a painless papule which ulcerates in the centre
so that the fully-developed chancre is an indurated lesion
with central ulceration accompanied by regional
lymphadenitis. The chancre heals without scarring, even in
the absence of treatment.
Histologically, the chancre has following features:
i) Dense infiltrate of mainly plasma cells, some
lymphocytes and a few macrophages.
ii) Perivascular aggregation of mononuclear cells, parti-
cularly plasma cells (periarteritis and endarteritis).
iii)  Proliferation of vascular endothelium.
Antibody tests are positive in 1-3 weeks after the appear-
ance of chancre. Spirochaetes can be demonstrated in the
exudates by DGI.
2.
SECONDARY SYPHILIS. Inadequately treated patients
of primary syphilis develop mucocutaneous lesions and
painless lymphadenopathy in 2-3 months after the exposure
(Fig. 6.34,B). Mucocutaneous lesions may be in the form of
the mucous patches on mouth, pharynx and vagina; and
generalised skin eruptions and condyloma lata in anogenital
region.
Antibody tests are always positive at this stage.
Secondary syphilis is highly infective stage and spirochaetes
can be easily demonstrated in the mucocutaneous lesions.
3.
TERTIARY SYPHILIS. After a latent period of appear-
ance of secondary lesions and about 2-3 years following first
exposure, tertiary lesions of syphilis appear. Lesions of
tertiary syphilis are much less infective than the other two
stages and spirochaetes can be demonstrated with great
difficulty. These lesions are of 2 main types (Fig. 6.34,C):
Figure 6.34
Organ involvement in various stages of acquired syphilis.
A, Primary syphilis: Primary lesion is ‘chancre’ on glans penis. B, Secondary syphilis: Mucocutaneous lesions—mucous patches on oral and vaginal
mucosa and generalised skin eruptions. C,Tertiary syphilis: Localised lesion as gumma of liver with scarring (hepar lobatum); diffuse lesions (right)
in aorta (aneurysm, narrowing of mouths of coronary ostia and incompetence of aortic valve ring) and nervous system.

163
CHAPTER 6
Inflammation and Healing
i)
Syphilitic gumma. It is a solitary, localised, rubbery
lesion with central necrosis, seen in organs like liver, testis,
bone and brain. In liver, the gumma is associated with
scarring of hepatic parenchyma (hepar lobatum).
Histologically, the structure of gumma shows the
following features (Fig. 6.35):
a) Central coagulative necrosis resembling caseation but
is less destructive so that outlines of necrosed cells can
still be faintly seen.
b) Surrounding zone of palisaded macrophages with
many plasma cells, some lymphocytes, giant cells and
fibroblasts.
ii) Diffuse lesions of tertiary syphilis. The lesions appear
following widespread dissemination of spirochaetes in the
body. The diffuse lesions are predominantly seen in
cardiovascular and nervous systems which are described in
detail later in the relevant chapters. Briefly, these lesions are
as under:
a) Cardiovascular syphilis mainly involves thoracic aorta. The
wall of aorta is weakened and dilated due to syphilitic aortitis
and results in aortic aneurysm, incompetence of aortic valve
and narrowing of mouths of coronary ostia (Chapter 15).
b) Neurosyphilis may manifest as:
meningovascular syphilis affecting chiefly the meninges;
tabes dorsalis affecting the spinal cord; and
general paresis affecting the brain.
CONGENITAL SYPHILIS. Congenital syphilis may develop
in a foetus of more than 16 weeks gestation who is exposed
to maternal spirochaetaemia. The major morphologic features
as under:
i)
Saddle-shaped nose deformity due to destruction of bridge
of the nose.
ii) The characteristic ‘Hutchinson’s teeth’ which are small,
widely spaced, peg-shaped permanent teeth.
iii) Mucocutaneous lesions of acquired secondary syphilis.
iv) Bony lesions like epiphysitis and periostitis.
v) Interstitial keratitis with corneal opacity.
vi) Diffuse fibrosis in the liver.
vii)Interstitial fibrosis of lungs.
viii) If the foetus with congenital syphilis is born dead, it is
premature, with macerated skin, enlarged spleen and liver,
and with syphilitic epiphysitis.
Histologically, the basic morphology of lesions in syphilis
is seen in all the affected organs: perivascular plasma cell
rich inflammatory infiltrate and endothelial cell
proliferation. Many spirochaetes can be demonstrated in
involved tissues.
ACTINOMYCOSIS
Actinomycosis is a chronic suppurative disease caused by
anaerobic bacteria, Actinomycetes israelii. The disease is
conventionally included in mycology though the causative
organism is filamentous bacteria and not true fungus. The
disease is worldwide in distribution. The organisms are
commensals in the oral cavity, alimentary tract and vagina.
The infection is always endogeneous in origin and not by
person-to-person contact. The organisms invade, proliferate
and disseminate in favourable conditions like break in
mucocutaneous continuity, some underlying disease etc.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Depending upon the
anatomic location of lesions, actinomycosis is of 4 types:
cervicofacial, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic (Fig. 6.36).
1.
Cervicofacial actinomycosis. This is the commonest
form (60%) and has the best prognosis. The infection enters
from tonsils, carious teeth, periodontal disease or trauma
following tooth extraction. Initially, a firm swelling
develops in the lower jaw (‘lumpy jaw’). In time, the mass
breaks down and abscesses and sinuses are formed. The
discharging pus contains typical tiny yellow sulphur

granules. The infection may extend into adjoining soft
tissues as well as may destroy the bone.
2.
Thoracic actinomycosis. The infection in the lungs is
due to aspiration of the organism from oral cavity or
extension of infection from abdominal or hepatic lesions.
Initially, the disease resembles pneumonia but
subsequently the infection spreads to the whole of lung,
pleura, ribs and vertebrae.
3.
Abdominal actinomycosis. This type is common in
appendix, caecum and liver. The abdominal infection
results from swallowing of organisms from oral cavity or
extension from thoracic cavity.
4.
Pelvic actinomycosis. Infection in the pelvis occurs
as a complication of intrauterine contraceptive devices
(IUCD’s).
Microscopically, irrespective of the location of actino-
mycosis, the following features are seen (Fig. 6.37):
i)
The inflammatory reaction is a granuloma with central
suppuration. There is formation of abscesses in the centre
of lesions and at the periphery chronic inflammatory cells,
giant cells and fibroblasts are seen.
ii) The centre of each abscess contains the bacterial
colony, ‘sulphur granule’, characterised by radiating
filaments (hence previously known as ray fungus) with
hyaline, eosinophilic, club-like ends representative of
secreted immunoglobulins.
iii) Bacterial stains reveal the organisms as gram-positive
filaments, nonacid-fast, which stain positively with
Gomori’s methenamine silver (GMS) staining.
SARCOIDOSIS (BOECK’S SARCOID)
Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease of unknown etiology. It is
worldwide in distribution and affects adults from 20-40 years
of age. The disease is characterised by the presence of non-
caseating epithelioid cell granulomas (‘sarcoid granuloma’)
in the affected tissues and organs, notably lymph nodes and
lungs. Other sites are the skin, spleen, uvea of the eyes,
salivary glands, liver and bones of hands and feet. The
histologic diagnosis is generally made by exclusion.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS. The cause of
sarcoidosis remains unknown. Currently, possible etiology
is an infectious or noninfectious environmental agent in a
genetically susceptible individual. Likely infectious agents
include Propionibacter acnes, atypical mycobacteria and
mycobacterial protein of M. tuberculosis. Since the disease is
characterised by granulomatous tissue reaction, possibility
of cell-mediated immune mechanisms has been suggested.
The following observations point towards a possible immune
origin of sarcoidosis:
1.
Just as in tuberculosis, sarcoidosis is characterised by
distinctive granulomatous response against poorly degradable
antigen, but quite unlike tuberculosis, the antigen in
sarcoidosis has eluded workers so far. PCR studies on
affected pulmonary tissue have given equivocal result as
regards presence of mycobacterial antigen.
2.
There are immunologic abnormalities in sarcoidosis is
substantiated by high levels of  CD4+T cells lavaged from lung
lesions. There is also elevation in levels of IL-2 receptors in
serum and in lavaged fluid from lungs.
3.
There is presence of activated alveolar macrophages which
elaborate cytokines that initiate the formation of non-
caseating granulomas.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The lesions in sarcoidosis
are generalised and may affect various organs and tissues
at sometime in the course of disease, but brunt of the
disease is borne by the lungs and lymph nodes (Fig. 6.38).
Microscopically, the following features are present
(Fig. 6.39):
1.
The diagnostic feature in sarcoidosis of any organ or
tissue is the non-caseating sarcoid granuloma, composed of
epithelioid cells, Langhans’ and foreign body giant cells
and surrounded peripherally by fibroblasts.
2.
Typically, granulomas of sarcoidosis are ‘naked’ i.e.
either devoid of peripheral rim of lymphocytes or there is
paucity of lymphocytes.
3.
In late stage, the granuloma is either enclosed by
hyalinised fibrous tissue or is replaced by hyalinised fibrous
mass.

CHAPTER 6
Inflammation and Healing
HEALING
Healing is the body response to injury in an attempt to restore
normal structure and function. Healing involves 2 distinct
processes:
Regeneration when healing takes place by proliferation of
parenchymal cells and usually results in complete restoration
of the original tissues.
Repair when healing takes place by proliferation of
connective tissue elements resulting in fibrosis and scarring.
At times, both the processes take place simultaneously.
REGENERATION
Some parenchymal cells are short-lived while others have a
longer lifespan. In order to maintain proper structure of
tissues, these cells are under the constant regulatory control
of their cell cycle. These include growth factors such as:
epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-
derived growth factor, endothelial growth factor,
transforming growth factor-β.
Cell cycle (page 26) is defined as the period between two
successive cell divisions and is divided into 4 unequal phases
(Fig. 6.40):
M (mitosis) phase: Phase of mitosis.
G1 (gap 1) phase: The daughter cell enters G1 phase after
mitosis.
S (synthesis) phase: During this phase, the synthesis of
nuclear DNA takes place.
G2 (gap 2) phase: After completion of nuclear DNA
duplication, the cell enters G2 phase.
G0 (gap 0) phase: This is the quiescent or resting phase of
the cell after an M phase.
Not all cells of the body divide at the same pace. Some
mature cells do not divide at all while others complete a cell
cycle every 16-24 hours. The main difference between slowly-
dividing and rapidly-dividing cells is the duration of G1
phase.
Figure 6.38
Common location of lesions in sarcoidosis. The lesions
are predominantly seen in lymph nodes and throughout lung parenchyma.
Figure 6.39
Sarcoidosis in lymph node. Characteristically, there are non-caseating epithelioid cell granulomas which have paucity of lympho-
cytes. A giant cell with inclusions is also seen in the photomicrograph (arrow).
4.
The giant cells in sarcoid granulomas contain certain
cytoplasmic inclusions as follows:
i)
Asteroid bodies which are eosinophilic and stellate-
shaped structures.
ii) Schaumann’s bodies or conchoid (conch like) bodies which
are concentric laminations of calcium and of iron salts,
complexed with proteins.
iii) Birefringent cytoplasmic crystals which are colourless.
Similar types of inclusions are also observed in chronic
berylliosis (Chapter 17).
KVIEM’S TEST. It is a useful intradermal diagnostic test.
The antigen prepared from involved lymph node or spleen
is injected intradermally. In a positive test, nodular lesion
appears in 3-6 weeks at the inoculation site which on
microscopic examination shows presence of non-caseating
granulomas.

166
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
Depending upon their capacity to divide, the cells of the
body can be divided into 3 groups: labile cells, stable cells,
and permanent cells.
1.
Labile cells. These cells continue to multiply throughout
life under normal physiologic conditions. These include:
surface epithelial cells of the epidermis, alimentary tract,
respiratory tract, urinary tract, vagina, cervix, uterine
endometrium, haematopoietic cells of bone marrow and cells
of lymph nodes and spleen.
2.
Stable cells. These cells decrease or lose their ability to
proliferate after adolescence but retain the capacity to
multiply in response to stimuli throughout adult life. These
include: parenchymal cells of organs like liver, pancreas,
kidneys, adrenal and thyroid; mesenchymal cells like smooth
muscle cells, fibroblasts, vascular endothelium, bone and
cartilage cells.
3.
Permanent cells. These cells lose their ability to proli-
ferate around the time of birth. These include: neurons of
nervous system, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle cells.
RELATIONSHIP OF PARENCHYMAL CELLS WITH
CELL CYCLE. If the three types of parenchymal cells des-
cribed above are correlated with the phase of cell cycle,
following inferences can be derived:
1.
Labile cells which are continuously dividing cells remain
in the cell cycle from one mitosis to the next.
2.
Stable cells are in the resting phase (G0) but can be stimu-
lated to enter the cell cycle.
3.
Permanent cells are non-dividing cells which have left
the cell cycle and die after injury.
Regeneration of any type of parenchymal cells involves
the following 2 processes:
i)
Proliferation of original cells from the margin of injury
with migration so as to cover the gap.
ii) Proliferation of migrated cells with subsequent
differentiation and maturation so as to reconstitute the
original tissue.
REPAIR
Repair is the replacement of injured tissue by fibrous tissue.
Two processes are involved in repair:
1.
Granulation tissue formation; and
2.
Contraction of wounds.
Repair response takes place by participation of
mesenchymal cells (consisting of connective tissue stem cells,
fibrocytes and histiocytes), endothelial cells, macrophages,
platelets, and the parenchymal cells of the injured organ.
Granulation Tissue Formation
The term granulation tissue derives its name from slightly
granular and pink appearance of the tissue. Each granule
corresponds histologically to proliferation of new small blood
vessels which are slightly lifted on the surface by thin
covering of fibroblasts and young collagen.
The following 3 phases are observed in the formation of
granulation tissue (Fig. 6.41):
1.
PHASE OF INFLAMMATION. Following trauma, blood
clots at the site of injury. There is acute inflammatory
response with exudation of plasma, neutrophils and some
monocytes within 24 hours.
2.
PHASE OF CLEARANCE. Combination of proteolytic
enzymes liberated from neutrophils, autolytic enzymes from
dead tissues cells, and phagocytic activity of macrophages
clear off the necrotic tissue, debris and red blood cells.
Figure 6.40
Parenchymal cells in relation to cell cycle (G0–Resting phase; G1, G2–Gaps; S–Synthesis phase; M–Mitosis phase). The inner
circle shown with green line represents cell cycle for labile cells; circle shown with yellow-orange line represents cell cycle for stable cells; and the
circle shown with red line represents cell cycle for permanent cells. Compare them with traffic signals—green stands for ‘go’ applies here to dividing
labile cells; yellow-orange signal for ‘ready to go’ applies here to stable cells which can be stimulated to enter cell cycle; and red signal for ‘stop’ here
means non-dividing permanent cells.

167
CHAPTER 6
Inflammation and Healing
3.
PHASE OF INGROWTH OF GRANULATION
TISSUE. This phase consists of 2 main processes: angio-
genesis or neovascularisation, and fibrogenesis.
i)
Angiogenesis (neovascularisation). Formation of new
blood vessels at the site of injury takes place by proliferation
of endothelial cells from the margins of severed blood vessels.
Initially, the proliferated endothelial cells are solid buds but
within a few hours develop a lumen and start carrying blood.
The newly formed blood vessels are more leaky, accounting
for the oedematous appearance of new granulation tissue.
Soon, these blood vessels differentiate into muscular
arterioles, thin-walled venules and true capillaries.
The process of angiogenesis is stimulated with proteolytic
destruction of basement membrane. Angiogenesis takes place
under the influence of following factors:
a) Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) elaborated by
mesenchymal cells while its receptors are present in
endothelial cells only.
b) Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming
growth factor-β (TGF-β), basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF) and surface integrins are all associated with
cellular proliferation.
ii) Fibrogenesis. The newly formed blood vessels are
present in an amorphous ground substance or matrix. The
new fibroblasts originate from fibrocytes as well as by mitotic
division of fibroblasts. Some of these fibroblasts have
combination of morphologic and functional characteristics
of smooth muscle cells (myofibroblasts). Collagen fibrils begin
to appear by about 6th day. As maturation proceeds, more
and more of collagen is formed while the number of active
fibroblasts and new blood vessels decreases. This results in
formation of inactive looking scar known as cicatrisation.
Contraction of Wounds
The wound starts contracting after 2-3 days and the process
is completed by the 14th day. During this period, the wound
is reduced by approximately 80% of its original size.
Contracted wound results in rapid healing since lesser
surface area of the injured tissue has to be replaced.
In order to explain the mechanism of wound contraction,
a number of factors have been proposed. These are as under:
1.
Dehydration as a result of removal of fluid by drying of
wound was first suggested but without being substantiated.
2.
Contraction of collagen was thought to be responsible for
contraction but wound contraction proceeds at a stage when
the collagen content of granulation tissue is very small.
3.
Discovery of myofibroblasts appearing in active
granulation tissue has resolved the controversy surrounding
the mechanism of wound contraction. These cells have
features intermediate between those of fibroblasts and
smooth muscle cells. Their migration into the wound area
and their active contraction decreases the size of the defect.
The evidences in support of this concept are both
morphological as well as functional characteristics of
modified fibroblasts or myofibroblasts as under:
i)
Fibrils present in the cytoplasm of these cells resemble
those seen in smooth muscle cells.
ii) These cells contain actin-myosin similar to that found in
non-striated muscle cells.
iii) Cytoplasm of these modified cells demonstrates
immunofluorescent labelling with anti-smooth muscle
antibodies.
iv) Nuclei of these cells have infoldings of nuclear membrane
like in smooth muscle cells.
v) These cells have basement membrane and desmosomes
which are not seen in ordinary fibroblasts.
vi) Drug response of granulation tissue is similar to that of
smooth muscle.
WOUND HEALING
Healing of skin wounds provides a classical example of
combination of regeneration and repair described above.
Wound healing can be accomplished in one of the following
two ways:
Healing by first intention (primary union)
Healing by second intention (secondary union).
Figure 6.41
Active granulation tissue has inflammatory cell infiltrate, newly formed blood vessels and young fibrous tissue in loose matrix.

168
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
Healing by First Intention (Primary Union)
This is defined as healing of a wound which has the following
characteristics:
i)
clean and uninfected;
ii) surgically incised;
iii) without much loss of cells and tissue; and
iv) edges of wound are approximated by surgical sutures.
The sequence of events in primary union is illustrated in
Fig. 6.42 and described below:
1.
Initial haemorrhage. Immediately after injury, the space
between the approximated surfaces of incised wound is filled
with blood which then clots and seals the wound against
dehydration and infection.
2.
Acute inflammatory response. This occurs within 24
hours with appearance of polymorphs from the margins of
incision. By 3rd day, polymorphs are replaced by
macrophages.
3.
Epithelial changes. The basal cells of epidermis from both
the cut margins start proliferating and migrating towards
incisional space in the form of epithelial spurs. A well-
approximated wound is covered by a layer of epithelium in
48 hours. The migrated epidermal cells separate the
underlying viable dermis from the overlying necrotic
material and clot, forming scab which is cast off. The basal
cells from the margins continue to divide. By 5th day, a
multilayered new epidermis is formed which is differentiated
into superficial and deeper layers.
4.
Organisation. By 3rd day, fibroblasts also invade the
wound area. By 5th day, new collagen fibrils start forming
which dominate till healing is completed. In 4 weeks, the
scar tissue with scanty cellular and vascular elements, a few
inflammatory cells and epithelialised surface is formed.
5.
Suture tracks. Each suture track is a separate wound and
incites the same phenomena as in healing of the primary
wound i.e. filling the space with haemorrhage, some
inflammatory cell reaction, epithelial cell proliferation along
the suture track from both margins, fibroblastic proliferation
and formation of young collagen. When sutures are removed
around 7th day, much of epithelialised suture track is avulsed
and the remaining epithelial tissue in the track is absorbed.
However, sometimes the suture track gets infected (stitch
abscess), or the epithelial cells may persist in the track (implan-
tation or epidermal cysts).
Thus, the scar formed in a sutured wound is neat due to
close apposition of the margins of wound; the use of adhesive
tapes avoids removal of stitches and its complications.
Healing by Second Intention (Secondary Union)
This is defined as healing of a wound having the following
characteristics:
i)
open with a large tissue defect, at times infected;
ii) having extensive loss of cells and tissues; and
iii) the wound is not approximated by surgical sutures but
is left open.
The basic events in secondary union are similar to
primary union but differ in having a larger tissue defect
which has to be bridged. Hence healing takes place from the
base upwards as well as from the margins inwards. The
healing by second intention is slow and results in a large, at
times ugly, scar as compared to rapid healing and neat scar
of primary union.
The sequence of events in secondary union is illustrated
in Fig. 6.43 and described below:
1.
Initial haemorrhage. As a result of injury, the wound
space is filled with blood and fibrin clot which dries.
2.
Inflammatory phase. There is an initial acute inflam-
matory response followed by appearance of macrophages
which clear off the debris as in primary union.
3.
Epithelial changes. As in primary healing, the epidermal
cells from both the margins of wound proliferate and migrate
Figure 6.42
Primary union of skin wounds. A, The incised wound as well as suture track on either side are filled with blood clot and there is
inflammatory response from the margins. B, Spurs of epidermal cells migrate along the incised margin on either side as well as around the suture
track. Formation of granulation tissue also begins from below. C, Removal of suture at around 7th day results in scar tissue at the sites of incision
and suture track.

169
CHAPTER 6
Inflammation and Healing
Figure 6.43
Secondary union of skin wounds. A, The open wound is filled with blood clot and there is inflammatory response at the junction of
viable tissue. B, Epithelial spurs from the margins of wound meet in the middle to cover the gap and separate the underlying viable tissue from
necrotic tissue at the surface forming scab. C, After contraction of the wound, a scar smaller than the original wound is left.
into the wound in the form of epithelial spurs till they meet
in the middle and re-epithelialise the gap completely.
However, the proliferating epithelial cells do not cover the
surface fully until granulation tissue from base has started
filling the wound space. In this way, pre-existing viable
connective tissue is separated from necrotic material and clot
on the surface, forming scab which is cast off. In time, the
regenerated epidermis becomes stratified and keratinised.
4.
Granulation tissue. Main bulk of secondary healing is
by granulations. Granulation tissue is formed by proliferation
of fibroblasts and neovascularisation from the adjoining
viable elements. The newly-formed granulation tissue is deep
red, granular and very fragile. With time, the scar on
maturation becomes pale and white due to increase in
collagen and decrease in vascularity. Specialised structures
of the skin like hair follicles and sweat glands are not replaced
unless their viable residues remain which may regenerate.
5.
Wound contraction. Contraction of wound is an
important feature of secondary healing, not seen in primary
healing. Due to the action of myofibroblasts present in
granulation tissue, the wound contracts to one-third to one-
fourth of its original size. Wound contraction occurs at a time
when active granulation tissue is being formed.

Complications
Infrequent, epidermal inclusion cyst formation
Suppuration, may require debridement
6.
Presence of infection. Bacterial contamination of an open
wound delays the process of healing due to release of
bacterial toxins that provoke necrosis, suppuration and
thrombosis. Surgical removal of dead and necrosed tissue,
debridement, helps in preventing the bacterial infection of open
wounds.
Differences between primary and secondary union of
wounds are given in Table 6.6.
Complications of Wound Healing
During the course of healing, following complications may
occur:
1.
Infection of wound due to entry of bacteria delays the
healing.
2.
Implantation (epidermal) cyst formation may occur due to
persistence of epithelial cells in the wound after healing.
3.
Pigmentation. Healed wounds may at times have rust-like
colour due to staining with haemosiderin. Some coloured
particulate material left in the wound may persist and impart
colour to the healed wound.
4.
Deficient scar formation. This may occur due to inadequate
formation of granulation tissue.

170
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
5.
Incisional hernia. A weak scar, especially after a
laparotomy, may be the site of bursting open of a wound
(wound dehiscence) or an incisional hernia.
6.
Hypertrophied scars and keloid formation. At times the scar
formed is excessive, ugly and painful. Excessive formation
of collagen in healing may result in keloid (claw-like)
formation, seen more commonly in Blacks. Hypertrophied
scars differ from keloid in that they are confined to the
borders of the initial wound while keloids have tumour-like
projection of connective tissue.
7.
Excessive contraction. An exaggeration of wound
contraction may result in formation of contractures or
cicatrisation e.g. Dupuytren’s (palmar) contracture, plantar
contracture and Peyronie’s disease (contraction of the
cavernous tissues of penis).
8.
Neoplasia. Rarely, scar may be the site for development
of carcinoma later e.g. squamous cell carcinoma in Marjolin’s
ulcer i.e. a scar following burns on the skin.
Extracellular Matrix— Wound Strength
The wound is strengthened by proliferation of fibroblasts
and myofibroblasts which get structural support from the
extracellular matrix (ECM). In addition to providing
structural support, ECM can direct cell migration,
attachment, differentiation and organisation.
ECM has five main components: collagen, adhesive
glycoproteins, basement membrane, elastic fibres, and
proteoglycans.
1.
COLLAGEN. The collagens are a family of proteins
which provide structural support to the multicellular
organism. It is the main component of tissues such as fibrous
tissue, bone, cartilage, valves of heart, cornea, basement
membrane etc.
Collagen is synthesised and secreted by a complex
biochemical mechanism on ribosomes. The collagen synthesis
is stimulated by various growth factors and is degraded by
collagenase. Regulation of collagen synthesis and
degradation take place by various local and systemic factors
so that the collagen content of normal organs remains
constant. On the other hand, defective regulation of collagen
synthesis leads to hypertrophied scar, fibrosis, and organ
dysfunction.
Depending upon the biochemical composition, 18 types
of collagen have been identified called collagen type I to XVIII,
many of which are unique for specific tissues. Type I collagen
is normally present in the skin, bone and tendons and
accounts for 90% of collagen in the body:
Type I, III and V are true fibrillar collagen which form the
main portion of the connective tissue during healing of
wounds in scars.
Other types of collagen are non-fibrillar and amorphous
material seen as component of the basement membranes.
Morphologically, the smallest units of collagen are
collagen fibrils, which align together in parallel bundles to
form collagen fibres, and then collagen bundles.
2.
ADHESIVE GLYCOPROTEINS. Various adhesive
glycoproteins acting as glue for the ECM and the cells consist
of fibronectin, tenascin (cytotactin) and thrombospondin.
i)
Fibronectin (nectere = to bind) is the best characterised
glycoprotein in ECM and has binding properties to other cells
and ECM. It is of two types—plasma and tissue fibronectin.
Plasma fibronectin is synthesised by the liver cells and is
trapped in basement membrane such as in filtration through
the renal glomerulus.
 Tissue fibronectin is formed by fibroblasts, endothelial
cells and other mesenchymal cells. It is responsible for the
primitive matrix such as in the foetus, and in wound healing.
ii) Tenascin or cytotactin is the glycoprotein associated with
fibroblasts and appears in wound about 48 hours after injury.
It disappears from mature scar tissue.
iii) Thrombospondin is mainly synthesised by granules of
platelets. It functions as adhesive protein for keratinocytes
and platelets but is inhibitory to attachment of fibroblasts
and endothelial cells.
3.
BASEMENT MEMBRANE. Basement membranes are
periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive amorphous structures
that lie underneath epithelia of different organs and
endothelial cells. They consist of collagen type IV and
laminin.
4.
ELASTIC FIBRES. While the tensile strength in tissue
comes from collagen, the ability to recoil is provided by elastic
fibres. Elastic fibres consist of 2 components—elastin
glycoprotein and elastic microfibril. Elastases degrade the
elastic tissue e.g. in inflammation, emphysema etc.
5.
PROTEOGLYCANS. These are a group of molecules
having 2 components—an essential carbohydrate polymer
(called polysaccharide or glycosaminoglycan), and a protein
bound to it, and hence the name proteo-glycan. Various
proteoglycans are distributed in different tissues as under:
i)
Chondroitin sulphate—abundant in cartilage, dermis
ii) Heparan sulphate—in basement membranes
iii) Dermatan sulphate—in dermis
iv) Keratan sulphate—in cartilage
v) Hyaluronic acid—in cartilage, dermis.
In wound healing, the deposition of proteoglycans
precedes collagen laying.
The strength of wound also depends upon factors like
the site of injury, depth of incision and area of wound. After
removal of stitches on around 7th day, the wound strength
is approximately 10% which reaches 80% in about 3 months.
TURNOVER OF ECM. ECM is not a static structure but
the matrix proteins comprising it undergo marked
remodeling during foetal life which slows down in adult
tissues. These matrix proteins are degraded by a family of
metalloproteinases which act under regulatory control of
inhibitors of metalloproteinases.
Factors Influencing Healing
Two types of factors influence the wound healing: those
acting locally, and those acting in general.
A. LOCAL FACTORS:
1.
Infection is the most important factor acting locally which
delays the process of healing.

171
CHAPTER 6
Inflammation and Healing
2.
Poor blood supply to wound slows healing e.g. injuries to
face heal quickly due to rich blood supply while injury to
leg with varicose ulcers having poor blood supply heals
slowly.
3.
Foreign bodies including sutures interfere with healing and
cause intense inflammatory reaction and infection.
4.
Movement delays wound healing.
5.
Exposure to ionising radiation delays granulation tissue
formation.
6.
Exposure to ultraviolet light facilitates healing.
7.
Type, size and location of injury determines whether
healing takes place by resolution or organisation.
B. SYSTEMIC FACTORS:
1.
Age. Wound healing is rapid in young and somewhat
slow in aged and debilitated people due to poor blood supply
to the injured area in the latter.
2.
Nutrition. Deficiency of constituents like protein, vitamin
C (scurvy) and zinc delays the wound healing.
3.
Systemic infection delays wound healing.
4.
Administration of glucocorticoids has anti-inflammatory
effect.
5.
Uncontrolled diabetics are more prone to develop infections
and hence delay in healing.
6.
Haematologic abnormalities like defect of neutrophil func-
tions (chemotaxis and phagocytosis), and neutropenia and
bleeding disorders slow the process of wound healing.
HEALING IN SPECIALISED TISSUES
Healing of the skin wound provides an example of general
process of healing by regeneration and repair. However, in
certain specialised tissues, either regeneration or repair may
predominate. Some of these examples are described below.
Fracture Healing
Healing of fracture by callus formation depends upon some
clinical considerations whether the fracture is:
traumatic (in previously normal bone), or pathological (in
previously diseased bone);
complete or incomplete like green-stick fracture; and
simple (closed), comminuted (splintering of bone), or
compound (communicating to skin surface).
However, basic events in healing of any type of fracture
are similar and resemble healing of skin wound to some
extent.
Primary union of fractures occurs in a few special
situations when the ends of fracture are approximated as is
done by application of compression clamps. In these cases,
bony union takes place with formation of medullary callus
without periosteal callus formation. The patient can be made
ambulatory early but there is more extensive bone necrosis
and slow healing.
Secondary union is the more common process of fracture
healing. Though it is a continuous process, secondary bone
union is described under the following 3 headings:
i)
Procallus formation
ii) Osseous callus formation
iii) Remodelling
These processes are illustrated in Fig. 6.44 and described
below:
I.
PROCALLUS FORMATION. Steps involved in the
formation of procallus are as follows:
1.
Haematoma forms due to bleeding from torn blood
vessels, filling the area surrounding the fracture. Loose
meshwork is formed by blood and fibrin clot which acts as
framework for subsequent granulation tissue formation.

macrophages clear away the fibrin, red blood cells,
inflammatory exudate and debris. Fragments of necrosed
bone are scavenged by macrophages and osteoclasts.
3.
Ingrowth of granulation tissue begins with neovascula-
risation and proliferation of mesenchymal cells from
periosteum and endosteum. A soft tissue callus is thus
formed which joins the ends of fractured bone without much
strength.
4.
Callus composed of woven bone and cartilage starts
within the first few days. The cells of inner layer of the
periosteum have osteogenic potential and lay down collagen
as well as osteoid matrix in the granulation tissue (Fig. 6.45).
The osteoid undergoes calcification and is called woven bone
callus. A much wider zone over the cortex on either side of
fractured ends is covered by the woven bone callus and
united to bridge the gap between the ends, giving spindle-
shaped or fusiform appearance to the union. In poorly
immobilised fractures (e.g. fracture ribs), the subperiosteal
osteoblasts may form cartilage at the fracture site. At times,
callus is composed of woven bone as well as cartilage, tempo-
rarily immobilising the bone ends.
This stage is called provisional callus or procallus
formation and is arbitrarily divided into external, intermediate
and internal procallus.
II. OSSEOUS CALLUS FORMATION. The procallus acts
as scaffolding on which osseous callus composed of lamellar
bone is formed. The woven bone is cleared away by incoming
osteoclasts and the calcified cartilage disintegrates. In their
place, newly-formed blood vessels and osteoblasts invade,
laying down osteoid which is calcified and lamellar bone is
formed by developing Haversian system concentrically
around the blood vessels.
III.  REMODELLING. During the formation of lamellar
bone, osteoblastic laying and osteoclastic removal are taking
place remodelling the united bone ends, which after
sometime, is indistinguishable from normal bone. The
external callus is cleared away, compact bone (cortex) is
formed in place of intermediate callus and the bone marrow
cavity develops in internal callus.
COMPLICATIONS OF FRACTURE HEALING. These are
as under:
1.
Fibrous union may result instead of osseous union if the
immobilisation of fractured bone is not done. Occasionally,
a false joint may develop at the fracture site (pseudo-
arthrosis).
2.
Non-union may result if some soft tissue is interposed
between the fractured ends.
3.
Delayed union may occur from causes of delayed wound
healing in general such as infection, inadequate blood supply,
poor nutrition, movement and old age.
Healing of Nervous Tissue
CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. The nerve cells of the
brain, spinal cord and ganglia once destroyed are not
replaced. Axons of CNS also do not show any significant
regeneration. The damaged neuroglial cells, however, may
show proliferation of astrocytes called gliosis.
PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. In contrast to the cells
of CNS, the peripheral nerves show regeneration, mainly
from proliferation of Schwann cells and fibrils from distal
end. The process is discussed in Chapter 30. Briefly, it consists
of the following:
Myelin sheath and axon of the intact distal nerve undergo
Wallerian degeneration up to the next node of Ranvier
towards the proximal end.
Degenerated debris are cleared away by macrophages.
Regeneration in the form of sprouting of fibrils takes place
from the viable end of axon. These fibrils grow along the
track of degenerated nerve so that in about 6-7 weeks, the
peripheral stump consists of tube filled with elongated
Schwann cells.
One of the fibrils from the proximal stump enters the old
neural tube and develops into new functional axon.
Healing of Muscle
All three types of muscle fibres have limited capacity to
regenerate.
SKELETAL MUSCLE. The regeneration of striated muscle
is similar to peripheral nerves. On injury, the cut ends of
muscle fibres retract but are held together by stromal
connective tissue. The injured site is filled with fibrinous
material, polymorphs and macrophages. After clearance of
damaged fibres by macrophages, one of the following two
types of regeneration of muscle fibres can occur:
If the muscle sheath is intact, sarcolemmal tubes
containing histiocytes appear along the endomysial tube
which, in about 3 months time, restores properly oriented
muscle fibres e.g. in Zenker’s degeneration of muscle in
typhoid fever.
If the muscle sheath is damaged, it forms a disorganised
multinucleate mass and scar composed of fibrovascular
tissue e.g. in Volkmann’s ischaemic contracture.
Figure 6.45
Callus formation in fracture healing.

173
CHAPTER 6
Inflammation and Healing
SMOOTH MUSCLE. Non-striated muscle has limited
regenerative capacity e.g. appearance of smooth muscle in
the arterioles in granulation tissue. However, in large
destructive lesions, the smooth muscle is replaced by
permanent scar tissue.
CARDIAC MUSCLE. Destruction of heart muscle is replaced
by fibrous tissue. However, in situations where the
endomysium of individual cardiac fibre is intact (e.g. in
diphtheria and coxsackie virus infections), regeneration of
cardiac fibres may occur in young patients.
Healing of Mucosal Surfaces
The cells of mucosal surfaces have very good regeneration
and are normally being lost and replaced continuously e.g.
mucosa of alimentary tract, respiratory tract, urinary tract,
uterine endometrium etc. This occurs by proliferation from
margins, migration, multilayering and differentiation of
epithelial cells in the same way as in the epidermal cells in
healing of skin wounds.
Healing of Solid Epithelial Organs
Following gross tissue damage to organs like the kidney, liver
and thyroid, the replacement is by fibrous scar e.g. in chronic
pyelonephritis and cirrhosis of liver. However, in
parenchymal cell damage with intact basement membrane
or intact supporting stromal tissue, regeneration may occur.
For example:
In tubular necrosis of kidney with intact basement
membrane, proliferation and slow migration of tubular
epithelial cells may occur to form renal tubules.
In viral hepatitis, if part of the liver lobule is damaged with
intact stromal network, proliferation of hepatocytes may
result in restoration of liver lobule.

Infectious and
Parasitic Diseases
Chapter 7
INTRODUCTION
Microorganisms, namely bacteria, viruses, fungi and
parasites, are present everywhere—in the soil, water, atmos-
phere and on the body surfaces, and are responsible for a
large number of infectious diseases in human beings. Some
microorganisms are distributed throughout the world while
others are limited to certain geographic regions only. In
general, tropical and developing countries are specially
affected by infectious diseases than the developed countries.
There are several examples of certain infectious diseases which
are not so common in the developed world now but they
continue to be major health problems in the developing
countries e.g. tuberculosis, leprosy, typhoid fever, cholera,
measles, pertussis, malaria, amoebiasis, pneumonia etc.
Vaccines have, however, been successful in controlling or
eliminating some diseases all over the world e.g. smallpox,
poliomyelitis, measles, pertussis etc. Similarly, insecticides
have helped in controlling malaria to an extent. However,
infections still rank very high as a cause of death in the world.
Reasons for this trend are not difficult to seek:
Development of newer and antibiotic-resistant strains of
microorganisms; classic example is that of methicillin-
resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA).
Administration of immunosuppressive therapy to
patients with malignant tumours and transplanted organs
making them susceptible to opportunistic infections
Increasing number of patients reporting to hospital for
different illnesses but instead many developing hospital-
acquired infections.
Lastly, discovery in 1981 of previously unknown deadly
disease i.e. acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
While talking of microbial infective diseases, let us not
forget the fact that many microorganisms may actually
benefit mankind. Following is the range of host-organism inter-
relationship, which may vary quite widely:
1.
Symbiosis i.e. cooperative association between two
dissimilar organisms beneficial to both.
2.
Commensalism i.e. two dissimilar organisms living
together benefitting one without harming the other.
3.
True parasitism i.e. two dissimilar organisms living
together benefitting the parasite but harming the host.
4.
Saprophytism  i.e. organisms living on dead tissues.
Besides microorganisms, more recently a modified host
protein present in the mammalian CNS has been identified
called prion protein. Prions are transmissible agents similar
to infectious particles but lack nucleic acid. These agents are
implicated in the etiology of spongiform encephalopathy,
(including kuru), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (or mad
cow disease) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (associated with
corneal transplantation). (Dr. Prusiner who discovered prion
protein was awarded Nobel Prize in medicine in 1997).
Transmission of infectious diseases requires a chain of
events and is the consequence of inter-relationship between
disease-producing properties of microorganisms and host-
defense capability against the invading organisms. Briefly,
chain in transmission of infections and factors determining
this host-microorganism relationship are given below:
Chain in Transmission of Infectious Diseases
Transmission of infections occurs following a chain of events
pertaining to various parameters as under:
i) Reservoir of pathogen. Infection occurs from the source
of reservoir of pathogen. It may be a human being (e.g. in
influenza virus), animal (e.g. dog for rabies), insect (e.g.
mosquito for malaria), or soil (e.g. enterobiasis).
ii) Route of infection. Infection is transmitted from the
reservoir to the human being by different routes, usually from
breach in the mucosa or the skin at both— the portal of exit
from the reservoir and the portal of entry in the susceptible
host.  In general, the organism is transmitted to the site where
the organism would normally flourish e.g. N. gonorrhoeae
usually inhabits the male and female urethra and, therefore,
the route of transmission would be sexual contact.
iii) Mode of transmission. The organism may be transmitted
directly by physical contact or by faecal contamination (e.g.
spread of eggs in hookworm infestation), or indirectly by
fomites (e.g. insect bite).
iv) Susceptible host. The organism would colonise the host
if the host has good immunity but such a host can pass on
infection to others. However, if the host is old, debilitated,
malnourished, or immunosuppressed due any etiology, he
is susceptible to have manifestations of infection.
Key to management of infection lies in breaking or
blocking this chain for transmission and spread of infection.
Factors Relating to Infectious Agents
These are as under:
i)
Mode of entry. Microorganisms causing infectious
diseases may gain entry into the body by various routes e.g.
through ingestion (external route);
inoculation (parenteral method);
inhalation (respiration);
perinatally (vertical transmission);
by direct contact (contagious infection); and

175
CHAPTER 7
Infectious and Parasitic Diseases
by contaminated water, food, soil, environment or from
an animal host (zoonotic infections).
ii) Spread of infection. Microorganisms after entering the
body may spread further through the phagocytic cells, blood
vessels and lymphatics.
iii) Production of toxins. Bacteria liberate toxins which have
effects on cell metabolism. Endotoxins are liberated on lysis
of the bacterial cell while exotoxins are secreted by bacteria
and have effects at distant sites too.
iv) Virulence of organisms. Many species and strains of
organisms may have varying virulence e.g. the three strains
of C. diphtheriae (gravis, intermedius and mitis) produce the
same diphtherial exotoxin but in different amounts.
v) Product of organisms. Some organisms produce enzy-
mes that help in spread of infections e.g. hyaluronidase by
Cl. welchii, streptokinase by streptococci, staphylokinase and
coagulase by staphylococci.
Factors Relating to Host
Microorganisms invade human body when defenses are not
adequate. These factors include the following:
i)
Physical barrier. A break in the continuity of the skin
and mucous membranes allows the microorganisms to enter
the body.
ii) Chemical barrier. Mucus secretions of the oral cavity and
the alimentary tract and gastric acidity prevent bacterial
colonisation.
iii) Effective drainage. Natural passages of the hollow organs
like respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary and genital system
provide a way to drain the excretions effectively. Similarly,
ducts of various glands are the conduits of drainage of
secretions. Obstruction in any of these passages promotes
infection.
iv) Immune defense mechanisms. These include the phago-
cytic leucocytes of blood (polymorphs and monocytes),
phagocytes of tissues (mononuclear-phagocyte system) and
the immune system as discussed in Chapter 4.
Some of the common diseases produced by pathogenic
microorganisms are discussed below. Each group of
microorganisms discussed here is accompanied by a Table
listing diseases produced by them. These lists of diseases
are in no way complete but include only important and
common examples. No attempts will be made to give details
of organisms as that would mean repeating what is given in
the textbooks of Microbiology. Instead, salient clinico-
pathologic aspects of these diseases are highlighted.
Methods of Identification
The organisms causing infections and parasitic diseases may
be identified by routine H & E stained sections in many
instances. However, confirmation in most cases requires
either application of special staining techniques or is
confirmed by molecular biologic methods (Table 7.1). In
addition, culture of lesional tissue should be carried out for
species identification and drug sensitivity. Generally, the
organism is looked for at the advancing edge of the lesion in
the section rather than in the necrotic centre (Fig. 7.1).
DISEASES CAUSED BY BACTERIA,
SPIROCHAETES AND MYCOBACTERIA
In order to gain an upper hand in human host, bacteria must
resist early engulfment by neutrophils. They survive and
damage the host in a variety of ways such as by generation
of toxins (e.g. gas-forming anaerobes), by forming a slippery
capsule that resists attachment to macrophages (e.g.
pneumococci), by inhibition of fusion of phagocytic vacuoles
with lysosomes (e.g. tubercle bacilli) etc.
Table 7.2 provides an abbreviated classification of
bacterial diseases and their etiologic agents. A few common
and important examples amongst these are discussed below.
PLAGUE
Plague is caused by Yersinia (Pasteurella) pestis which is a
small Gram-negative coccobacillus that grows rapidly on
most culture media. Direct identification of the organism in
tissues is possible by fluorescence antisera methods.
Plague has been a great killer since 14th century and is
known to have wiped out populations of cities. However,
the modern Europe is plague free, possibly due to
widespread use of arsenic as rat poison. Currently, the world
over, Vietnam and Tanzania have most cases of plague.
However, an outbreak in Surat in the state of Gujarat in
Western part of India in 1994 alarmed the world once again
that we are not totally free of this dreaded ‘black death’.
Plague is a zoonotic disease and spreads by rodents,
primarily by rats, both wild and domestic; others being
squirrels and rabbits. Humans are incidental hosts other than
rodents.
Infection to humans occurs by rat-flea or by inhalation.
After the organisms enter the bloodstream, they reach the
draining lymph nodes where, rather than being phago-
cytosed by phagocytic cells, they proliferate rapidly giving

rise to tender lymphadenopathy. This occurs within 24-48
hours of infection and is accompanied by chills, fever,
myalgia, nausea, vomiting and marked prostration. If
untreated, death occurs from disseminated intravascular
coagulation (DIC) within 1 to 2 days with development of
widespread petechiae and ecchymoses leading to gangrene,
and hence the name black death. In other cases, death results
from multi-organ failure due to profound toxaemia. The
patient and his fluids are highly infectious and can be trans-
mitted by arthropods as well as person-to-person contact,
giving rise to secondary cases.
Virulence of the organism Y. pestis is attributed to the
elaboration of plague toxins: pesticin and lipopolysaccharide
endotoxin.

BUBONIC PLAGUE. This form is characterised by rapid
appearance of tender, fluctuant and enlarged regional
lymph nodes, several centimeters in diameter, and may
have discharging sinuses on the skin.
Microscopically, the features are as under:
Effaced architecture of lymph nodes due to necrosis
in and around the affected nodes.
Multiple necrotising granulomas.
Characteristic mononuclear inflammatory response.
Masses of proliferating bacilli in sinusoids of lymph
nodes.
Cellulitis in the vicinity.
PNEUMONIC PLAGUE. This is the most dreaded form
of plague that occurs by inhalation of bacilli from air-borne
particles of carcasses of animals or from affected patient’s
cough. It is characterised by occurrence of broncho-
pneumonia, with the following conspicuous microscopic
features:
Necrosis of alveolar walls.
Intense hyperaemia and haemorrhages.
Numerous bacilli in the alveolar lumina.
Characteristic mononuclear inflammatory response
with very scanty neutrophils.
TYPHOIDAL PLAGUE. This form of plague is
unassociated with regional lymphadenopathy. The lesions
in typhoidal plague are as follows:
Necrotic foci in visceral lymphoid tissue.
Necrotic areas in parenchymal visceral organs.
G.I. manifestations with diarrhoea and pain abdomen.
SEPTICAEMIC PLAGUE.  This is a form of progressive,
fulminant bacterial infection associated with profound
septicaemia in the absence of apparent regional
lymphadenitis.

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
ANTHRAX
Anthrax is a bacterial disease of antiquity caused by Bacillus
anthracis that spreads from animals to man. The disease is
widely prevalent in cattle and sheep but human infection is
rare. However, much of knowledge on human anthrax has
been gained owing to fear of use of these bacteria for military
purpose by rogue countries or for “bio-terrorism” (other
microbial diseases in this list include: botulism, pneumonic
plague, smallpox). A few years back, the human form of
disease attracted a lot of attention of the media and the
civilised world due to its use in the form of anthrax-laced
letters sent by possible terrorist groups as a retaliatory
biological weapon against the US interest subsequent to
punitive attacks by the US on Afghanistan as an aftermath
of September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the US. In India,
anthrax in animals is endemic in South due to large
unprotected and uncontrolled live-stock population.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The causative organism, Bacillus
anthracis, is a gram-positive, aerobic bacillus, 4.5 μm long. It
is a spore-forming bacillus and the spores so formed outside
the body are quite resistant. The disease occurs as an
exogenous infection by contact with soil or animal products
contaminated with spores.
Depending upon the portal of entry, three types of human
anthrax is known to occur:
i)
Cutaneous form by direct contact with skin and is most
common.
ii) Pulmonary form by inhalation, also called as “wool-
sorters’ disease” and is most fatal.
iii) Gastrointestinal form by ingestion and is rare.
The mechanism of infection includes spread of bacilli
from the portal of entry to the regional lymph nodes through
lymphatics where the bacteria proliferate. There is delayed
accumulation of polymorphs and macrophages.
Macrophages also play a role in expression of bacterial
toxicity; bacterial toxin is quite lethal to macrophages.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The characteristic lesions
of anthrax are haemorrhage, oedema and necrosis at the
portal of entry.
1. Cutaneous anthrax is the most common and occurs in
two forms: one type is characterised by necrotic lesion due
to vascular thrombosis, haemorrhage and acellular
necrosis, while the other form begins as a pimple at the
point of entry of B. anthracis into the abraded exposed skin,
more often in the region of hands and the head and neck.
The initial lesion develops into a vesicle or blister
containing clear serous or blood-stained fluid swarming
with anthrax bacilli which can be identified readily by
smear examination. The bursting of the blister is followed
by extensive oedema and black tissue necrosis resulting
in formation of severe ‘malignant pustule’. Regional
lymph nodes are invariably involved along with profound
septicaemia.
2. Pulmonary anthrax (wool-sorters’ disease) occurring
from inhalation of spores of B. anthracis in infectious
aerosols results in rapid development of malignant
pustule in the bronchus. This is followed by development
of primary extensive necrotising pneumonia and
haemorrhagic mediastinitis which is invariably fatal.
3. Intestinal anthrax is rare in human beings and is quite
similar to that seen in cattle. Septicaemia and death often
results in this type too. The lesions consist of mucosal
oedema, small necrotic ulcers, massive fluid loss and
haemorrhagic mesenteric lymphadenitis.
Besides, anthrax septicaemia results in spread of
infection to all other organs.
LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS. Anthrax can be diagnosed by
a few simple techniques:
i) Smear examination: Gram stained smear shows rod-shaped,
spore-forming, gram-positive bacilli. Endospores are
detectable by presence of unstained defects or holes within
the cell.
ii) Culture: Anthrax bacteria grow on sheep blood agar as
flat colonies with an irregular margin (medusa head).
Anthrax contaminated work surfaces, materials and
equipment must be decontaminated with 5% hypochlorite
or 5% phenol.
WHOOPING COUGH (PERTUSSIS)
Whooping cough is a highly communicable acute bacterial
disease of childhood caused by Bordetella pertussis. The use
of DPT vaccine has reduced the prevalence of whooping
cough in different populations.
The causative organism, B. pertussis, has strong tropism
for the brush border of the bronchial epithelium. The
organisms proliferate here and stimulate the bronchial
epithelium to produce abundant tenacious mucus. Within
7-10 days after exposure, catarrhal stage begins which is the
most infectious stage. There is low grade fever, rhinorrhoea,
conjunctivitis and excess tear production. Paroxysms of
cough occur with characteristic ‘whoop’. The condition is self-
limiting but may cause death due to asphyxia in infants. B.
pertussis produces a heat-labile toxin, a heat-stable endotoxin,
and a lymphocytosis-producing factor called histamine-
sensitising factor.
Microscopically, the lesions in the respiratory tract consist
of necrotic bronchial epithelium covered by thick
mucopurulent exudate. In severe cases, there is mucosal
erosion and hyperaemia. The peripheral blood shows
marked lymphocytosis upto 90% (Fig. 7.3) and
enlargement of lymphoid follicles in the bronchial mucosa
and peribronchial lymph nodes.
GRANULOMA INGUINALE
Granuloma inguinale is a sexually-transmitted disease
affecting the genitalia and inguinal and perianal regions
caused by Calymmatobacterium donovani. The disease is
common in tropical and subtropical countries such as New
Guinea, Australia and India. The organism inhabits the
intestinal tract. The infection is transmitted through vaginal

179
CHAPTER 7
Infectious and Parasitic Diseases
or anal intercourse and by autoinoculation. The incubation
period varies from 2 to 4 weeks. Initially, the lesion is in the
form of a papule, a subcutaneous nodule or an ulcer. Within
a few weeks, it develops into a raised, soft, painless, reddish
ulcer with exuberant granulation tissue. Depending upon
whether the individual is heterosexual or homosexual, the
lesions are located on the penis, scrotum, genito-crural folds
and inguinal folds, or in the perianal and anal area respecti-
vely. Regional lymphadenopathy generally does not occur.
Microscopically, the margin of the ulcer shows epithelial
hyperplasia. The ulcer bed shows neutrophilic abscesses.
The dermis and subcutaneous tissues are infiltrated by
numerous histiocytes containing many bacteria called
Donovan bodies, and lymphocytes, plasma cells and
neutrophils. These organisms are best demonstrated by
silver impregnation techniques.
STAPHYLOCOCCAL INFECTIONS
Staphylococci are gram-positive cocci which are present
everywhere—in the skin, umbilicus, nasal vestibule, stool
etc. Three species are pathogenic to human beings: Staph.
aureus, Staph. epidermidis and Staph. saprophyticus. Most
staphylococcal infections are caused by Staph. aureus.
Staphylococcal infections are among the commonest
antibiotic-resistant hospital-acquired infection in surgical
wounds.
A wide variety of suppurative diseases are caused by
Staph. aureus which includes the following (Fig. 7.4):
1.
Infections of skin. Staphylococcal infections of the skin
are quite common. The infection begins from lodgement of
cocci in the hair root due to poor hygiene and results in
obstruction of sweat or sebaceous gland duct. This is termed
folliculitis. Involvement of adjacent follicles results in larger
lesions called furuncle. Further spread of infection
horizontally under the skin and subcutaneous tissue causes
carbuncle or cellulitis. Styes are staphylococcal infection of the
sebaceous glands of Zeis, the glands of Moll and eyelash
follicles. Impetigo is yet another staphylococcal skin infection
common in school children in which there are multiple
pustular lesions on face forming honey-yellow crusts. Breast
abscess may occur following delivery when staphylococci are
transmitted from infant having neonatal sepsis or due to
stasis of milk.
2.
Infections of burns and surgical wounds. These are quite
common due to contamination from the patient’s own nasal
secretions or from hospital staff. Elderly, malnourished, obese
patients and neonates have increased susceptibility.
3. Infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract.
Small children under 2 years of age get staphylococcal
infections of the respiratory tract commonly. These include
pharyngitis, 
bronchopneumonia, 
staphylococcal
pneumonia and its complications.
4.
Bacterial arthritis. Septic arthritis in the elderly is caused
by Staph. aureus.

Infection of bone (Osteomyelitis). Young boys having
history of trauma or infection may develop acute
staphylococcal osteomyelitis (Chapter 28).
6.
Bacterial endocarditis. Acute and subacute bacterial
endocarditis are complications of infection with Staph. aureus
and Staph. epidermidis (Chapter 16).

Bacterial meningitis. Surgical procedures on central
nervous system may lead to staphylococcal meningitis
(Chapter 30).

Septicaemia. Staphylococcal septicaemia may occur in
patients with lowered resistance or in patients having
underlying staphylococcal infections. Patients present with
features of bacteraemia such as shaking chills and fever
(Chapter 6).
9.
Toxic shock syndrome. Toxic shock syndrome is a serious
complication of staphylococcal infection characterised by
fever, hypotension and exfoliative skin rash. The condition
affects young menstruating women who use tampons of
some brands which when kept inside the vagina cause
absorption of staphylococcal toxins from the vagina.
STREPTOCOCCAL INFECTIONS
Streptococci are also gram-positive cocci but unlike
staphylococci, they are more known for their non-
suppurative autoimmune complications than suppurative
inflammatory responses. Streptococcal infections occur
throughout the world but their problems are greater in
underprivileged populations where antibiotics are not
instituted readily.
The following groups and subtypes of streptococci have
been identified and implicated in different streptococcal
diseases (Fig. 7.5):
1.
Group A or Streptococcus pyogenes, also called β-haemo-
lytic streptococci, are involved in causing upper respiratory
tract infection and cutaneous infections (erysipelas). In
addition, beta haemolytic streptococci are involved in
autoimmune reactions in the form of rheumatic heart disease
(RHD).
2.
Group B or Streptococcus agalactiae produces infections in
the newborn and is involved in non-suppurative post-
streptococcal complications such as RHD and acute
glomerulonephritis.
3.
Group C and G streptococci are responsible for respiratory
infections.
4.
Group D or Streptococcus faecalis, also called enterococci
are important in causation of urinary tract infection, bacterial
endocarditis, septicaemia etc.
5.
Untypable α-haemolytic streptococci such as Streptococcus
viridans constitute the normal flora of the mouth and may
cause bacterial endocarditis.
6.
Pneumococci or Streptococcus pneumoniae are etiologic
agents for bacterial pneumonias, meningitis and septicaemia.
CLOSTRIDIAL DISEASES
Clostridia are gram-positive spore-forming anaerobic
microorganisms found in the gastrointestinal tract of
herbivorous animals and man. These organisms may
undergo vegetative division under anaerobic conditions, and
sporulation under aerobic conditions. These spores are
passed in faeces and can survive in unfavourable conditions.
On degeneration of these microorganisms, the plasmids are
liberated which produce many toxins responsible for the
following clostridial diseases depending upon the species
(Fig. 7.6):
1.
Gas gangrene by C. perfringens
2.
Tetanus by C. tetani
3.
Botulism by C. botulinum
4.
Clostridial food poisoning by C. perfringens
5.
Necrotising enterocolitis by C. perfringens.
GAS GANGRENE. Gas gangrene is a rapidly progressive
and fatal illness in which there is myonecrosis of previously
healthy skeletal muscle due to elaboration of myotoxins by
some species of clostridia. In majority of cases (80-90%), the
source of myotoxins is C. perfringens Type A; others are C.
novyi and C. septicum. Generally, traumatic wounds and
surgical procedures are followed by contamination with
clostridia and become the site of myonecrosis. The incuba-
tion period is 2 to 4 days. The most common myotoxin
produced by C. perfringens Type A is the alpha toxin which
is a lecithinase. The prevention of gas gangrene lies in
debridement of damaged tissue in which the clostridia thrive.
The lesion has serosanguineous discharge with odour and
contains gas bubbles. There is very scanty inflammatory
reaction at the site of gas gangrene.
TETANUS. Tetanus or ‘lock jaw’ is a severe acute neuro-
logic syndrome caused by tetanus toxin, tetanospasmin,
which is a neurotoxic exotoxin elaborated by C. tetani. The
spores of the microorganism present in the soil enter the body
through a penetrating wound. In underdeveloped countries,
tetanus in neonates is seen due to application of soil or dung
on the umbilical stump. The degenerated microorganisms
liberate the tetanus neurotoxin which causes neuronal
stimulation and spasm of muscles. The incubation period of
the disease is 1-3 weeks. The earliest manifestation is lock-
jaw or trismus. Rigidity of muscles of the back causes
backward arching or opisthotonos. Death occurs due to
spasm of respiratory and laryngeal muscles.

Diseases caused by streptococci.

181
CHAPTER 7
Infectious and Parasitic Diseases
BOTULISM. Botulism is characterised by symmetric
paralysis of cranial nerves, limbs and trunk. The condition
occurs following ingestion of food contaminated with
neurotoxins of C. botulinum and less often by contamination
of a penetrating wound. The spores of C. botulinum are
capable of surviving in unfavourable conditions and
contaminate vegetables and other foods, especially if
improperly stored or canned. The symptoms of botulism
begin to appear within 12 to 36 hours of ingestion of food
containing the neurotoxins (type A to type G). The toxins
resist gastric digestion and are absorbed from the upper
portion of small intestine and enter the blood. On reaching
the cholinergic nerve endings, the toxin binds to membrane
receptors and inhibits release of acetylcholine resulting in
paralysis and respiratory failure.
CLOSTRIDIAL FOOD POISONING. Clostridial food
poisoning is caused by enterotoxin elaborated by C.
perfringens. Out of five serotypes of C. perfringens, type A
and C produce alpha-enterotoxin that causes food poisoning.
These serotypes of organism are omnipresent in the
environment and thus clostridial poisoning occurs
throughout the world. Food poisoning from C. perfringens is
mostly from ingestion of meat and its products which have
been allowed to dry resulting in dehydration and anaerobic
conditions suitable for growth of C. perfringens. The
contaminated meat contains vegetative form of the organism
and no preformed enterotoxin (unlike botulism where pre-
formed neurotoxin of C. botulinum is ingested). On ingestion
of the contaminated meat, alpha-enterotoxin is produced in
the intestine. Symptoms of the food poisoning appear within
12 hours of ingestion of contaminated meat and recovery
occurs within 2 days.
NECROTISING ENTEROCOLITIS. Necrotising entero-
colitis or ‘pig bel’ is caused by beta-enterotoxin produced by
C. perfringens Type C. The condition occurs especially in
undernourished children who suddenly indulge in
overeating such as was first reported participation in pig
feasts by poor children in New Guinea and hence the name
‘pig bel’. Adults do not develop the condition due to good
antibody response.
Ingestion of contaminated pork by malnourished children
who normally take protein-deficient vegetarian diet causes
elaboration of beta-enterotoxin. The symptoms appear within
48 hours after ingestion of contaminated meat. These include:
severe abdominal pain, distension, vomiting and passage of
bloody stools. Milder form of disease runs a course similar
to other forms of gastroenteritis while fulminant ‘pig bel’
may result in death of the child.
Grossly, the disease affects small intestine segmentally.
The affected segment of bowel shows green, necrotic
pseudomembrane covering the necrotic mucosa and there
is associated peritonitis. Advanced cases may show
perforation of the bowel wall.
Microscopically, there is transmural infiltration by acute
inflammatory cell infiltrate with changes of mucosal
infarction, oedema and haemorrhage (Chapter 20). The
pseudomembrane consists of necrotic epithelium with
entangled bacilli.
DISEASES CAUSED BY FUNGI
Of the large number of known fungi, only a few are infective
to human beings. Many of the human fungal infections are
opportunistic i.e. they occur in conditions with impaired host
immune mechanisms. Such conditions include defective
neutrophil function, administration of corticosteroids,
immunosuppressive therapy and immunodeficiency states
(congenital and acquired). A list of common fungal infections
of human beings is given in Table 7.3. A few important
representative examples are discussed below.

182
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
MYCETOMA
Mycetoma is a chronic suppurative infection involving a
limb, shoulder or other tissues and is characterised by
draining sinuses. The material discharged from the sinuses
is in the form of grains consisting of colonies of fungi or
bacteria. Mycetomas are of 2 main types:
Mycetomas caused by actinomyces (higher bacteria)
comprising about 60% of cases (page 163).
Eumycetomas caused by true fungi comprising the
remaining 40% of the cases.
Most common fungi causative for eumycetoma are
Madurella mycetomatis or Madurella grisea, both causing black
granules from discharging sinuses. Eumycetomas are
particularly common in Northern and tropical Africa,
Southern Asia and tropical America. The organisms are
inoculated directly from soil into barefeet, from carrying of
contaminated sacks on the shoulders, and into the hands from
infected vegetation.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. After several months of
infection, the affected site, most commonly foot, is swollen
and hence the name ‘madura foot’. The lesions extend
deeply into the subcutaneous tissues, along the fascia and
eventually invade the bones. They drain through sinus
tracts which discharge purulent material and grains. The
surrounding tissue shows granulomatous reaction
(Fig. 7.7).
CANDIDIASIS
Candidiasis is an opportunistic fungal infection caused most
commonly by Candida albicans and occasionally by Candida
tropicalis. In human beings, Candida species are present as
normal flora of the skin and mucocutaneous areas, intestines
and vagina. The organism becomes pathogenic when the
balance between the host and the organism is disturbed.
Various predisposing factors are: impaired immunity,
prolonged use of oral contraceptives, long-term antibiotic
therapy, corticosteroid therapy, diabetes mellitus, obesity,
pregnancy etc.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Candida produces super-
ficial infections of the skin and mucous membranes, or
may invade deeper tissues as described under:
1.
Oral thrush. This is the commonest form of muco-
cutaneous candidiasis seen especially in early life. Full-
fledged lesions consist of creamy white pseudomembrane
composed of fungi covering the tongue, soft palate, and
buccal mucosa. In severe cases, ulceration may be seen.
2.
Candidal vaginitis. Vaginal candidiasis or monilial
vaginitis is characterised clinically by thick, yellow, curdy
discharge. The lesions form pseudomembrane of fungi on
the vaginal mucosa. They are quite pruritic and may
extend to involve the vulva (vulvovaginitis) and the
perineum.
3.
Cutaneous candidiasis. Candidal involvement of nail
folds producing change in the shape of nail plate
(paronychia) and colonisation in the intertriginous areas
of the skin, axilla, groin, infra- and inter-mammary,
intergluteal folds and interdigital spaces are some of the
common forms of cutaneous lesions caused by Candida
albicans (Fig. 7.8).
4.
Systemic candidiasis. Invasive candidiasis is rare and
is usually a terminal event of an underlying disorder
associated with impaired immune system. The organisms
gain entry into the body through an ulcerative lesion on
the skin and mucosa or may be introduced by iatrogenic
means such as via intravenous infusion, peritoneal dialysis
or urinary catheterisation. The lesions of systemic
candidiasis are most commonly encountered in kidneys
as ascending pyelonephritis and in heart as candidal
endocarditis.

CHAPTER 7
Infectious and Parasitic Diseases
SUPERFICIAL MYCOSIS
Dermatophytes are the most important example of cutaneous
mycosis caused by Microsporum, Trichophyton and
Epidermophyton. These superficial fungi are spread by direct
contact or by fomites and infect tissues such as the skin, hair
and nails. Examples of diseases pertaining to these tissues
are as under:
Tinea capitis characterised by patchy alopecia affecting
the scalp and eyebrows.
Tinea barbae is acute folliculitis of the beard.
Tinea corporis is dermatitis with formation of
erythematous papules.
The diagnosis of dermatophytosis is made by light
microscopic examination of skin scrapings after addition of
sodium or potassium hydroxide solution. Other methods
include fungal culture and demonstration of fungus in tissue
sections.
DISEASES CAUSED BY VIRUSES
Viral diseases are the most common cause of human illness.
However, many of the viral infections remain asymptomatic
while others produce viral disease. Another peculiar feature
of viral infection is that a single etiologic agent may produce
different diseases in the same host depending upon host
immune response and age at infection e.g. varicella-zoster
virus is causative for chickenpox as well as herpes zoster.
Viruses are essentially intracellular parasites. Depending
upon their nucleic acid genomic composition, they may be
single-stranded or double-stranded, RNA or DNA viruses.
A list of common viruses and diseases caused by them is
given in Table 7.4. Oncogenic viruses and their role in
neoplasms are discussed in Chapter 8. A few common and
important viral diseases are described below.
VIRAL HAEMORRHAGIC FEVERS
Viral haemorrhagic fevers are a group of acute viral infections
which have common features of causing haemorrhages,
shock and sometimes death. Viruses causing haemorrhagic
fevers were earlier called arthropod-borne (or arbo) viruses
since their transmission was considered to be from
arthropods to humans. However, now it is known that all
such viruses are not transmitted by arthropod vectors alone
and hence now such haemorrhagic fevers are classified
according to the routes of transmission and other
epidemiologic features into 4 groups:
Mosquito-borne (e.g. yellow fever, dengue fever, Rift
Valley fever)
Tick-borne (e.g. Crimean haemorrhagic fever, Kyasanur
Forest disease)
Zoonotic (e.g. Korean haemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever)
Marburg virus disease and Ebola virus disease by
unknown route.
Of these, mosquito-borne viral haemorrhagic fevers in
which Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are vectors, are the most
common problem the world over, especially in developing
countries. Two important examples of Aedes mosquito-borne
viral haemorrhagic fevers are yellow fever and dengue fever,
which are discussed below.
Yellow Fever
Yellow fever is the oldest known viral haemorrhagic fever
restricted to some regions of Africa and South America.

184
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
Monkeys carry the virus without suffering from illness and
the virus is transmitted from them to humans by Aedes aegypti
as vector.
Yellow fever is characterised by the following clinical
features: Sudden onset of high fever, chills, myalgia,
headache, jaundice, hepatic failure, renal failure, bleeding
disorders and hypotension.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Major pathologic changes
are seen in the liver and kidneys.
Liver. The characteristic changes include:
i)
midzonal necrosis;
ii) Councilman bodies; and
iii) microvesicular fat.
Kidneys. The kidneys show the following changes:
i)
coagulative necrosis of proximal tubules;
ii) accumulation of fat in the tubular epithelium; and
iii) haemorrhages.
Patients tend to recover without sequelae and death
rate is less than 5%, death resulting from hepatic or renal
failure, and petechial haemorrhages in the brain.
Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF)
The word dengue is derived from African word ‘denga’
meaning fever with haemorrhages. Dengue is caused by virus
transmitted by bites of mosquito Aedes aegypti; the
transmission being highest during and after rainy season
when mosquitos are numerous. DHF was first described in
1953 when it struck Philippines. An outbreak of DHF
occurred in Delhi and neighbouring cities in 1996 claiming
several lives. Since then, some cases of DHF have been
reported in post-monsoon period every year in North India.
Dengue occurs in two forms:
1.
Dengue fever or break-bone fever in an uncomplicated way
is a self-limited febrile illness affecting muscles and joints
with severe back pain due to myalgia (and hence the name
‘break-bone’ fever).
2.
Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), on the other hand, is a
severe and potentially fatal form of acute febrile illness
characterised by cutaneous and intestinal haemorrhages due
to thrombocytopenia, haemoconcentration, hypovolaemic
shock and neurologic disturbances. DHF is most common in
children under 15 years of age.
Dengue virus infects blood monocytes, lymphocytes and
endothelial cells. This initiates complement activation and
consumptive coagulopathy including thrombocytopenia. The
entire process takes place rapidly and may evolve over a
period of a few hours. If patient is treated appropriately at
this stage, there is rapid and dramatic recovery. But in
untreated cases, dengue shock syndrome develops and death
occurs.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The predominant organ
changes in DHF are due to following:
i)
focal haemorrhages and congestion;
ii) increased vascular permeability resulting in oedema
in different organs;
iii) coagulopathy with thrombocytopenia; and
iv) haemoconcentration.
The main abnormalities in investigations in DHF are
as under:
i)
Leucopenia with relative lymphocytosis, sometimes
with atypical lymphocytes
ii) Thrombocytopenia
iii) Elevated haematocrit due to haemoconcentration
iv) X-ray chest showing bilateral pleural effusion
v) Deranged liver function tests (elevated transaminases,
hypoalbuminaemia and reversed A:G ratio)
vi) Prolonged coagulation tests (prothrombin time,
activated partial thromboplastin time and thrombin time)
Diagnosis of DHF is confirmed by:
serologic testing for detection of antibodies;
detection of virus by immunofluorescence method and
monoclonal antibodies; and
rapid methods such as reverse transcriptase-PCR and
fluorogenic-ELISA.
At autopsy, the predominant organ changes observed
are as follows:
i)
Brain: intracranial haemorrhages, cerebral oedema,
dengue encephalitis.
ii) Liver: enlarged; necrosis of hepatocytes and Kupffer
cells, Reye’s syndrome in children.
iii) Kidneys: petechial haemorrhages and features of renal
failure.
iv) Muscles and joints: perivascular mononuclear cell
infiltrate.
Chikungunya Virus Infection
The word chikungunya means “that which bends up” and
is derived from the language in Africa where this viral
disease was first found in human beings. Chikungunya virus
infection is primarily a disease in nonhuman primates but
the infection is transmitted to humans by A. aegypti
mosquito. The disease is endemic in parts of Africa and Asia
and occurs sporadically elsewhere. A massive outbreak
occurred in 2004 in Indian Ocean region affecting people in
Sri Lanka, Maldives, Mauritius and parts of India.
Clinically, the disease is characterised by abrupt onset of
fever, severe arthralgia (producing bending posture of
patient due to pain and hence the name), migratory
polyarthritis affecting small joints, chills, headache, anorexia,
nausea, abdominal pain, rash, petechiae and ocular
symptoms such as photophobia.
Major laboratory findings include leucopenia, mild
thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminases and raised CRP.
INFLUENZA VIRUS INFECTIONS
Influenza virus infection is an important and common form
of communicable disease, especially prevalent as a seasonal
infection in the developed countries. Its general clinical
features range from a mild afebrile illness similar to common
cold by appearance of sudden fever, headache, myalgia,
malaise, chills and respiratory tract manifestations such as
cough, soar throat to a more severe form of acute respiratory

185
CHAPTER 7
Infectious and Parasitic Diseases
illness and lymphadenopathy. Various forms of influenza
virus infections have occurred as an outbreak at different
times, sometimes with alarming morbidity and mortality in
the world. Seasonal flu vaccine is administered to population
at high risk in these countries.
ETIOLOGIC AGENT. Influenza virus is a single-stranded
RNA virus belonging to coronaviruses. Depending upon its
antigenic characteristics of the nucleoprotein and matrix, 3
distinct types are known: A, B and C. Out of these, influenza
type A is responsible for most serious and severe forms of
outbreaks in human beings while types B and C cause a milder
form of illness. Type A influenza virus is further subtyped
based on its 2 viral surface features:
Haemagglutinin (H): H antigen elicits host immune
response by antibodies and determines the future
protection against influenza A viruses. There are 16 distinct
H subtypes of type A influenza viruses.
Neuraminidase (N): Antibody response against N antigen
limits the spread of viral infection and is responsible for
reduction of infection. N antigen of influenza A exists in 9
subtypes.
Thus, the subtypes of influenza A viruses are
designated by denoting serial subtype numbers of H and
N antigens as H1N1, H2N2 etc.
Influenza A viruses infect human beings, birds, pigs and
horses. In view of a high antigenic variation in H and N
components, influenza A viruses are responsible for many
known epidemics and pandemics in history and in present
times. Major antigenic variation in H or N antigens is called
antigenic shift while minor variation is termed antigenic drift.
In general, population at high risk are immunosuppressed
patients, elderly individuals and infants.
Two of the known subtypes of influenza A viruses which
have affected the mankind in recent times and have attracted
a lot of attention of the media and the WHO are as under:
Avian influenza virus A/H5N1 commonly called
“bird flu”.
Swine influenza virus A/H1N1 commonly called
“swine flu”.
 These two entities are briefly discussed below.
Bird Flu ((Influenza A/H5N1)
H5N1 subtype of the influenza type A virus infection causes
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which is the
human form of bird flu or avian influenza with having
similar symptomatology. Every year, there have been
outbreaks in poultry birds in different parts of the world
resulting in slaughtering of millions of infected chickens
every year. Human outbreak of the disease called SARS
reemerged in December 2003 in southern China, Hong Kong
and Vietnam and then spread to other countries in Asia,
Europe and America. Since then, every year there have been
seasonal outbreaks in the human form of the disease in high
winter and has so far affected 15 countries and taken a toll
of over 250 lives. Its rapidly downhill and fatal clinical course
and an apprehension of pandemic has sent alarm bells all
over world for quarantine.
PATHOGENESIS. SARS is caused by influenza type A/
H5N1 respiratory virus, also called SARS-associated
coronaviruses (SARS-CoV). Though it is not fatal for wild
birds, it can kill poultry birds and people. Humans acquire
infection through contaminated nasal, respiratory and faecal
material from infected birds. An individual who has human
flu and also gets infected with bird flu, then the hybrid virus
so produced is highly contagious and causes lethal disease.
No person-to-person transmission has been reported so far
but epidemiologists fear that if it did occur it will be a global
epidemic. Humans do not have immune protection against
avian viruses.
LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS. Following abnormalities in
laboratory tests are noted:
1.
Almost normal-to-low TLC with lymphopaenia in about
half the cases, mostly due to fall in CD4+ T cells.
2.
Thrombocytopaenia.
3.
Elevated liver enzymes: aminotransferases, creatine kinase
and LDH.
4.
 Virus isolation by reverse transcriptase-PCR on
respiratory sample, plasma, urine or stool.
5.
Tissue culture.
6.
Detection of serum antibodies by ELISA or
immunofluorescence.
CLINICOPATHOLOGICAL FEATURES. Typically, the
disease begins with influenza-like features such as fever,
cough, dyspnoea, sore throat, muscle aches and eye
infection. Soon, the patient develops viral pneumonia
evident on X-ray chest and acute respiratory distress (hence
the term SARS), and terminally kidney failure.
There is apprehension of an epidemic of SARS if the avian
virus mutates and gains the ability to cause person-to-person
infection. Since currently vaccine is yet being developed, the
available measures are directed at prevention of infection
such as by culling (killing of the infected poultry birds) and
isolation of infected case.
Swine Flu (Influenza A/H1N1)
H1N1 influenza type A flu which appeared last in 1977-78 as
a mild form of pandemic has reappeared in April 2009 as an
outbreak in Mexico but is rapidly spreading elsewhere.
Presently, the disease has already spread to 39 countries
including US. In view of rising number of cases, with about
10,000 confirmed cases and about 100 deaths by end-May 2009
attributed to swine flu from all over the world, the WHO has
alerted that it may become a worldwide flu pandemic.
PATHOGENESIS. H1N1 influenza type A virus is primarily
an infection in pigs with low mortality in them. Human beings
acquire infection by direct contact with infected pigs.
However, further transmission of H1N1 flu occurs by person-
to-person contact such as by coughing, sneezing etc but it is
not known to occur from eating pork.

186
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
CLINICAL FEATURES. The disease has the usual flu-like
clinical features, but additionally one-third of cases have been
found to have diarrhoea and vomiting.
Since human beings do not have immune protection by
antibody response against H1N1 influenza type A and the
usual seasonal flu vaccine does not provide protection against
H1N1, personal hygiene and prophylaxis remain the mainstay
of further spread of disease.
VARICELLA ZOSTER  VIRUS INFECTION
Varicella zoster virus is a member of herpes virus family and
causes chickenpox (varicella) in non-immune individuals and
herpes zoster (shingles) in those who had chickenpox in the
past.
Varicella or chickenpox is an acute vesicular exanthem
occurring in non-immune persons, especially children. The
condition begins as an infection of the nasopharynx. On
entering the blood stream, viraemia is accompanied by onset
of fever, malaise and anorexia. Maculopapular skin rash,
usually on the upper trunk and face, develops in a day or
two. This is followed by formation of vesicles which rupture
and heal with formation of scabs. A few cases may develop
complications which include pneumonia, hepatitis,
encephalitis, carditis, orchitis, arthritis, and haemorrhages.
Herpes zoster or shingles is a recurrent, painful, vesicular
eruption caused by reactivation of dormant varicella zoster
virus in an individual who had chickenpox in the earlier
years. The condition is infectious and spreads to children.
The virus during the latent period resides in the dorsal root
spinal ganglia or in the cranial nerve ganglia. On reactivation,
the virus spreads from the ganglia to the sensory nerves and
to peripheral nerves. Unlike chickenpox, the vesicles in
shingles are seen in one or more of the sensory dermatomes
and along the peripheral nerves. The lesions are particularly
painful as compared with painless eruptions in chickenpox.
HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS INFECTION
Two of the herpes simplex viruses (HSV)—type 1 and 2,
cause ‘fever blisters’ and herpes genitalis respectively.
HSV-1 causes vesicular lesions on the skin, lips and
mucous membranes. The infection spreads by close contact.
The condition is particularly severe in immunodeficient
patients and neonates while milder attacks of infection cause
fever-blisters on lips, oral mucosa and skin. Severe cases may
develop complications such as meningoencephalitis and
keratoconjunctivitis. Various stimuli such as fever, stress and
respiratory infection reactivate latent virus lying in the
ganglia and result in recurrent attacks of blisters.
HSV-2 causes herpes genitalis characterised by vesicular
and necrotising lesions on the cervix, vagina and vulva. Like
HSV-1 infection, lesions caused by HSV-2 are also recurrent
and develop in non-immune individuals. Latency of HSV-2
infection is similar to HSV-1 and the organisms are
reactivated by stimuli such as menstruation and sexual
intercourse.
LYMPHOGRANULOMA  VENEREUM
Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually-
transmitted disease caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and is
characterised by mucocutaneous lesions and regional
lymphadenopathy. Though described here under viral
infections, chlamydia are no more considered as filterable
viruses as was previously thought but are instead
intracellular gram-negative bacteria. LGV is worldwide in
distribution but its prevalence rate is high in tropics and
subtropics in Africa, South-East Asia and India.
The condition begins as a painless, herpes-like lesion on
the cervix, vagina, or penis. The organisms are carried via
lymphatics to regional lymph nodes. The involved lymph
nodes are tender, fluctuant and may ulcerate and drain pus.
Microscopically, the lymph nodes have characteristic
stellate-shaped abscesses surrounded by a zone of
epithelioid cells (granuloma). Healing stage of the acute
lesion takes place by fibrosis and permanent destruction
of lymphoid structure.
CAT-SCRATCH DISEASE
Another condition related to LGV, cat-scratch disease, is
caused by Bartonella henselae, an organism linked to rickettsiae
but unlike rickettsiae this organism can be grown in culture.
The condition occurs more commonly in children (under 18
years of age). There is regional nodal enlargement which
appears about 2 weeks after cat-scratch, and sometimes after
thorn injury. The lymphadenopathy is self-limited and
regresses in 2-4 months.
Microscopically the changes in lymph node are
characteristics:
i)
Initially, there is formation of non-caseating sarcoid-
like granulomas.
ii) Subsequently, there are neutrophilic abscesses
surrounded by pallisaded histiocytes and fibroblasts, an
appearance simulating LGV discussed above.
iii) The organism is extracellular and can be identified by
silver stains.
RABIES
Rabies is a fatal form of encephalitis in humans caused by
rabies virus. The virus is transmitted into the human body
by a bite by infected carnivores e.g. dog, wolf, fox and bats.
The virus spreads from the contaminated saliva of these
animals. The organism enters a peripheral nerve and then
travels to the spinal cord and brain. A latent period of 10
days to 3 months may elapse between the bite and onset of
symptoms. Since the virus localises at the brainstem, it
produces classical symptoms of difficulty in swallowing and
painful spasm of the throat termed hydrophobia. Other
clinical features such as irritability, seizure and delirium point
towards viral encephalopathy. Death occurs within a period
of a few weeks.
Microscopically, neurons of the brainstem show
characteristic Negri bodies which are intracytoplasmic,
deeply eosinophilic inclusions.

Infectious and Parasitic Diseases
DISEASES CAUSED BY PARASITES
Diseases caused by parasites (protozoa and helminths) are
quite common and comprise a very large group of
infestations and infections in human beings. Parasites may
cause disease due to their presence in the lumen of the
intestine, due to infiltration into the blood stream, or due to
their presence inside the cells. A short list of parasitic diseases
is given in Table 7.5. These diseases form a distinct subject
of study called Parasitology; only a few conditions are briefly
considered below.
AMOEBIASIS
Amoebiasis is caused by Entamoeba histolytica, named for its
lytic action on tissues. It is the most important intestinal
infection of man. The condition is particularly more common
in tropical and subtropical areas with poor sanitation.
The parasite occurs in 2 forms: a trophozoite form which is
active adult form seen in the tissues and diarrhoeal stools,
and a cystic form seen in formed stools but not in the tissues.
The trophozoite form can be stained positively with PAS stain
in tissue sections while amoebic cysts having four nuclei can
be identified in stools. The cysts are the infective stage of the
parasite and are found in contaminated water or food. The
trophozoites are formed from the cyst stage in the intestine
and colonise in the caecum and large bowel. The trophozoites
as well as cysts are passed in stools but the trophozoites fail
to survive outside or are destroyed by gastric secretions.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The lesions of amoebiasis
include amoebic colitis, amoeboma, amoebic liver abscess
and spread to other sites (Fig. 7.9).
Amoebic colitis, the most common type of amoebic
infection begins as a small area of necrosis of mucosa
which may ulcerate. These ulcerative lesions may enlarge,
develop undermining of margins of the ulcer due to lytic

malariae. While Plasmodium falciparum causes malignant
malaria, the other three species produce benign form of
illness. These parasites are transmitted by bite of female
Anopheles mosquito. The disease is endemic in several parts
of the world, especially in tropical Africa, parts of South and
Central America, India and South-East Asia.
The life cycle of plasmodia is complex and is diagram-
matically depicted in Fig. 7.11, A. P. falciparum differs from
other forms of plasmodial species in 4 respects:
Figure 7.10
Amoebic colitis. Section from margin of amoebic ulcer

action of the trophozoite and have necrotic bed. Such
chronic amoebic ulcers are described as flask-shaped
ulcers due to their shape. The margin of the ulcer shows
inflammatory response consisting of admixture of poly-
morphonuclear as well as mononuclear cells besides the
presence of trophozoites of Entamoeba histolytica (Fig. 7.10).
Amoeboma is the inflammatory thickening of the wall
of large bowel resembling carcinoma of the colon.
Microscopically, the lesion consists of inflammatory
granulation tissue, fibrosis and clusters of trophozoites at
the margin of necrotic with viable tissue.
Amoebic liver abscess may be formed by invasion of
the radicle of the portal vein by trophozoites. Amoebic
liver abscess may be single or multiple (Chapter 21). The
amoebic abscess contains yellowish-grey amorphous
liquid material in which trophozoites are identified at the
junction of the viable and necrotic tissue.
Other sites where spread of amoebic infection may
occur are peritonitis by perforation of amoebic ulcer of
colon, extension to the lungs and pleura by rupture of
amoebic liver abscess, haematogenous spread to cause
amoebic carditis and cerebral lesions, cutaneous
amoebiasis via spread of rectal amoebiasis or from anal
intercourse.
MALARIA
Malaria is a protozoal disease caused by any one or
combination of four species of plasmodia: Plasmodium vivax,
Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium

189
CHAPTER 7
Infectious and Parasitic Diseases
2.
In falciparum malaria, there is massive absorption of
haemoglobin by the renal tubules producing blackwater
fever (haemoglobinuric nephrosis).
3.
At autopsy, cerebral malaria is characterised by
congestion and petechiae on the white matter.
4.
Parasitised erythrocytes in falciparum malaria are
sticky and get attached to endothelial cells resulting in
obstruction of capillaries of deep organs such as of the
brain leading to hypoxia and death. If the patient lives,
microhaemorrhages and microinfarcts may be seen in the
brain.
The diagnosis of malaria is made by demonstration of
malarial parasite in thin or thick blood films or sometimes
in histologic sections (Fig. 7.12).
Major complications occur in severe falciparum malaria
which may have manifestations of cerebral malaria (coma),
hypoglycaemia, renal impairment, severe anaemia,
i)
It does not have exo-erythrocytic stage.
ii) Erythrocytes of any age are parasitised while other
plasmodia parasitise juvenile red cells.
iii) One red cell may contain more than one parasite.
iv) The parasitised red cells are sticky causing obstruction
of small blood vessels by thrombi, a feature which is
responsible for extraordinary virulence of P. falciparum.
The main clinical features of malaria are cyclic peaks of
high fever accompanied by chills, anaemia and
splenomegaly.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Parasitisation and destruc-
tion of erythrocytes are responsible for major pathologic
changes as under (Fig. 7.11,B):
1.
Malarial pigment liberated by destroyed red cells
accumulates in the phagocytic cells of the reticulo-
endothelial system resulting in enlargement of the spleen
and liver (hepatosplenomegaly).

haemoglobinuria, jaundice, pulmonary oedema, and acidosis
followed by congestive heart failure and hypotensive shock.
FILARIASIS
Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi are responsible for
causing Bancroftian and Malayan filariasis in different
geographic regions. The lymphatic vessels inhabit the adult
worm, especially in the lymph nodes, testis and epididymis.
Microfilariae seen in the circulation are produced by the
female worm (Fig. 7.13). Majority of infected patients remain
asymptomatic. Symptomatic cases may have two forms of
disease—an acute form and a chronic form.
Acute form of filariasis presents with fever, lymphangitis,
lymphadenitis, epididymo-orchitis, urticaria, eosinophilia
and microfilariaemia.
Chronic form of filariasis is characterised by lymphadeno-
pathy, lymphoedema, hydrocele and elephantiasis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The most significant
histologic changes are due to the presence of adult worms
in the lymphatic vessels causing lymphatic obstruction
and lymphoedema. The regional lymph nodes are
enlarged and their sinuses are distended with lymph. The
tissues surrounding the blocked lymphatics are infiltrated
by chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate consisting of
lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils.
Chronicity of the process causes enormous thickening and
induration of the skin of legs and scrotum resembling the
hide of an elephant and hence the name elephantiasis.
Chylous ascites and chyluria may occur due to rupture of
the abdominal lymphatics.
CYSTICERCOSIS
Cysticercosis is infection by the larval stage of Taenia solium,
the pork tapeworm. The adult tapeworm resides in the
human intestines. The eggs are passed in human faeces which
are ingested by pigs or they infect vegetables. These eggs
then develop into larval stages in the host, spread by blood
to any site in the body and form cystic larvae termed
cysticercus cellulosae. Human beings may acquire infection
by the larval stage by eating undercooked pork (‘measly
pork’), by ingesting uncooked contaminated vegetables, and
sometimes, by autoinfection.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The cysticercus may be
single or there may be multiple cysticerci in the different
tissues of the body. The cysts may occur virtually
anywhere in body and accordingly produce symptoms;
most common sites are the brain, skeletal muscle and skin.
Cysticercus consists of a round to oval white cyst, about
1 cm in diameter, contains milky fluid and invaginated
scolex with birefringent hooklets. The cysticercus may
remain viable for a long time and incite no inflammation.
But when the embryo dies, it produces granulomatous
reaction with eosinophils. Later, the lesion may become
scarred and calcified (Fig. 7.14).
TORCH COMPLEX
Acronym ‘TORCH’ complex refers to development of
common complex of symptoms in infants due to infection
with different microorganisms that include: Toxoplasma,
Others, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex virus;
category of ‘Others’ refers to infections such as hepatitis B,
coxsackievirus B, mumps and poliovirus. The infection may
be acquired by the foetus during intrauterine life, or
perinatally and damage the foetus or infant. Since the
symptoms produced by TORCH group of organisms are
indistinguishable from each other, it is a common practice in
a suspected pregnant mother or infant to test for all the four
main TORCH agents.

CHAPTER 7
Infectious and Parasitic Diseases
Figure 7.15
Lesions produced by TORCH complex infection in
foetus in utero.
It has been estimated that TORCH complex infections
have an overall incidence of 1-5% of all live born children.
All the microorganisms in the TORCH complex are
transmitted transplacentally and, therefore, infect the foetus
from the mother. Herpes and cytomegalovirus infections are
common intrapartum infections acquired venereally.
Toxoplasmosis is a protozoal infection acquired by
contact with cat’s faeces or by ingestion of raw uncooked
meat. Rubella or German measles is teratogenic in pregnant
mothers. Cytomegalovirus and herpesvirus infection are
generally transmitted to foetus by chronic carrier mothers.
An infectious mononucleosis-like disease is present in
about 10% of mothers whose infants have Toxoplasma
infection. Genital herpes infection is present in 20% of
mothers whose newborn babies suffer from herpes infection.
Rubella infection during acute stage in the first 10 weeks of
pregnancy is more harmful to the foetus than at later stage
of gestation. Symptoms of cytomegalovirus infection are
present in less than 1% of mothers who display antibodies
to it.
The classic features of syndrome produced by TORCH
complex are seen in congenital rubella. The features include:
ocular defects, cardiac defects, CNS manifestations, sensori-
neural deafness, thrombocytopenia and hepatosplenomegaly
(Fig. 7.15).
The foetal damage caused by TORCH complex infection
is irreparable and, therefore, prevention and immunisation
are the best mode of therapy.

Neoplasia
Chapter 8
NOMENCLATURE AND CLASSIFICATION
INTRODUCTION. The term ‘neoplasia’ means new growth;
the new growth produced is called ‘neoplasm’ or ‘tumour’.
However, all ‘new growths’ are not neoplasms since
examples of new growth of tissues and cells also exist in the
processes of embryogenesis, regeneration and repair,
hyperplasia and hormonal stimulation. The proliferation and
maturation of cells in normal adults is controlled as a result
of which some cells proliferate throughout life (labile cells),
some have limited proliferation (stable cells), while others
do not replicate (permanent cells). On the other hand,
neoplastic cells lose control and regulation of replication and
form an abnormal mass of tissue.
Therefore, satisfactory definition of a neoplasm or tumour
is ‘a mass of tissue formed as a result of abnormal, excessive,
uncoordinated, autonomous and purposeless proliferation of cells
even after cessation of stimulus for growth which caused it’. The
branch of science dealing with the study of neoplasms or
tumours is called oncology (oncos=tumour, logos=study).
Neoplasms may be ‘benign’ when they are slow-growing and
localised without causing much difficulty to the host, or
‘malignant’ when they proliferate rapidly, spread throughout
the body and may eventually cause death of the host. The
common term used for all malignant tumours is cancer.
Hippocrates (460-377 BC) coined the term karkinos for cancer
of the breast. The word ‘cancer’ means crab, thus reflecting
the true character of cancer since ‘it sticks to the part
stubbornly like a crab’.
All tumours, benign as well as malignant, have 2 basic
components:
‘Parenchyma’ comprised by proliferating tumour cells;
parenchyma determines the nature and evolution of the
tumour.
‘Supportive stroma’ composed of fibrous connective tissue
and blood vessels; it provides the framework on which the
parenchymal tumour cells grow.
The tumours derive their nomenclature on the basis of
the parenchymal component comprising them. The suffix
‘-oma’ is added to denote benign tumours. Malignant tumours
of epithelial origin are called carcinomas, while malignant
mesenchymal tumours are named sarcomas (sarcos = fleshy)
(Fig. 8.1). However, some cancers are composed of highly
undifferentiated cells and are referred to as undifferentiated
malignant tumours.
Although, this broad generalisation regarding
nomenclature of tumours usually holds true in majority of
instances, some examples contrary to this concept are:
melanoma for carcinoma of the melanocytes, hepatoma for
carcinoma of the hepatocytes, lymphoma for malignant
tumour of the lymphoid tissue, and seminoma for malignant
tumour of the testis. Leukaemia is the term used for cancer of
blood forming cells.
SPECIAL CATEGORIES OF TUMOURS. Following
categories of tumours are examples which defy the
generalisation in nomenclature given above:
1.
Mixed tumours. When two types of tumours are
combined in the same tumour, it is called a mixed tumour.
For example:
i)
Adenosquamous carcinoma is the combination of
adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in the
endometrium.
Figure 8.1
Examples of carcinoma (epithelial malignant tumour) (A) and sarcoma (mesenchymal malignant tumour) (B).

193
CHAPTER 8
Neoplasia
ii) Adenoacanthoma is the mixture of adenocarcinoma and
benign squamous elements in the endometrium.
iii) Carcinosarcoma is the rare combination of malignant
tumour of the epithelium (carcinoma) and of mesenchymal
tissue (sarcoma) such as in thyroid.
iv) Collision tumour is the term used for morphologically two
different cancers in the same organ which do not mix with
each other.
v) Mixed tumour of the salivary gland (or pleomorphic
adenoma) is the term used for benign tumour having
combination of both epithelial and mesenchymal tissue
elements.
2. Teratomas. These tumours are made up of a mixture of
various tissue types arising from totipotent cells derived from
the three germ cell layers—ectoderm, mesoderm and
endoderm. Most common sites for teratomas are ovaries and
testis (gonadal teratomas). But they occur at extra-gonadal sites
as well, mainly in the midline of the body such as in the head
and neck region, mediastinum, retroperitoneum,
sacrococcygeal region etc. Teratomas may be benign or mature
(most of the ovarian teratomas) or malignant or immature
(most of the testicular teratomas).
3. Blastomas (Embryomas). Blastomas or embryomas are a
group of malignant tumours which arise from embryonal or
partially differentiated cells which would normally form
blastema of the organs and tissue during embryogenesis.
These tumours occur more frequently in infants and children
(under 5 years of age) and include some examples of tumours
in this age group: neuroblastoma, nephroblastoma (Wilms’
tumour), hepatoblastoma, retinoblastoma, medulloblastoma,
pulmonary blastoma.
4. Hamartoma. Hamartoma is benign tumour which is made
of mature but disorganised cells of tissues indigenous to the
particular organ e.g. hamartoma of the lung consists of
mature cartilage, mature smooth muscle and epithelium.
Thus, all mature differentiated tissue elements which
comprise the bronchus are present in it but are jumbled up
as a mass.
5. Choristoma. Choristoma is the name given to the ectopic
islands of normal tissue. Thus, choristoma is heterotopia but
is not a true tumour, though it sounds like one.
CLASSIFICATION. Currently, classification of tumours is
based on the histogenesis (i.e. cell of origin) and on the
anticipated behaviour (Table 8.1). However, it must be

mentioned here that the classification described here is only
a summary. Detailed classifications of benign and malignant
tumours pertaining to different tissues and body systems
along with morphologic features of specific tumours appear
in the specific chapters of Systemic Pathology later.
CHARACTERISTICS OF TUMOURS
Majority of neoplasms can be categorised clinically and
morphologically into benign and malignant on the basis of
certain characteristics listed below.  However, there are
exceptions—a small proportion of tumours have some
features suggesting innocent growth while other features
point towards a more ominous behaviour. Therefore, it must
be borne in mind that based characteristics of neoplasms,
there is a wide variation in the degree of deviation from the
normal in all the tumours.
The characteristics of tumours are described under the
following headings:
I.
Rate of growth
II. Cancer phenotype and stem cells
III. Clinical and gross features
IV. Microscopic features
V. Local invasion (Direct spread)
VI. Metastasis (Distant spread).
Based on these characteristics, contrasting features of
benign and malignant tumours are summarised in Table 8.2
and illustrated in Fig. 8.2.
I.  RATE OF GROWTH
The tumour cells generally proliferate more rapidly than the
normal cells. In general, benign tumours grow slowly and
malignant tumours rapidly. However, there are exceptions
to this generalisation. The rate at which the tumour enlarges
depends upon 2 main factors:
1.
Rate of cell production, growth fraction and rate of cell
loss
2.
Degree of differentiation of the tumour.
1.
Rate of cell production, growth fraction and rate of cell
loss. Rate of growth of a tumour depends upon 3 important
parameters:
i)
doubling time of tumour cells,
ii) number of cells remaining in proliferative pool (growth
fraction), and
iii) rate of loss of tumour cells by cell shedding.
In general, malignant tumour cells have increased mitotic
rate (doubling time) and slower death rate i.e. the cancer cells
do not follow normal controls in cell cycle and are immortal.
If the rate of cell division is high, it is likely that tumour cells
in the centre of the tumour do not receive adequate
nourishment and undergo ischaemic necrosis. At a stage
when malignant tumours grow relentlessly, they do so
because a larger proportion of tumour cells remain in
replicative pool but due to lack of availability of adequate
nourishment, these tumour cells are either lost by shedding
or leave the cell cycle to enter into G0 (resting phase) or G1

phase. While dead tumour cells appear as ‘apoptotic figures’
(Chapter 3), the dividing cells of tumours are seen as normal
and abnormal ‘mitotic figures’ (discussed later). Ultimately,
malignant tumours grow in size because the cell production
exceeds the cell loss.
2.
Degree of differentiation. Secondly, the rate of growth
of malignant tumour is directly proportionate to the degree
of differentiation. Poorly differentiated tumours show
aggressive growth pattern as compared to better differen-
tiated tumours. Some tumours, after a period of slow growth,
may suddenly show spurt in their growth due to develop-
ment of an aggressive clone of malignant cells. On the other
hand, some tumours may cease to grow after sometime.
Rarely, a malignant tumour may disappear spontaneously
from the primary site, possibly due to necrosis caused by

good host immune attack, only to reappear as secondaries
elsewhere in the body e.g. choriocarcinoma, malignant
melanoma.
The regulation of tumour growth is under the control of
growth factors secreted by the tumour cells. Out of various
growth factors, important ones modulating tumour biology
are listed below and discussed later:
i)
Epidermal growth factor (EGF)
ii)
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)

iv) Colony stimulating factor (CSF)

II.  CANCER PHENOTYPE AND STEM CELLS
Normally growing cells in an organ are related to the
neighbouring cells—they grow under normal growth
controls, perform their assigned function and there is a
balance between the rate of cell proliferation and the rate of
cell death including cell suicide (i.e. apoptosis). Thus normal
cells are socially desirable. However, cancer cells exhibit anti-
social behaviour as under:
i)
Cancer cells disobey the growth controlling signals in the
body and thus proliferate rapidly.
ii) Cancer cells escape death signals and achieve immortality.
iii) Imbalance between cell proliferation and cell death in
cancer causes excessive growth.
iv) Cancer cells lose properties of differentiation and thus
perform little or no function.
v) Due to loss of growth controls, cancer cells are genetically
unstable and develop newer mutations.
vi) Cancer cells overrun their neighbouring tissue and invade
locally.
vii) Cancer cells have the ability to travel from the site of
origin to other sites in the body where they colonise and
establish distant metastasis.
Cancer cells originate by clonal prolferation of a single
progeny of a cell (monoclonality). Cancer  cells arise from
stem cells normally present in the tissues in small number
and are not readily identifiable. These stem cells have the
properties of prolonged self-renewal, asymmetric replication
and transdifferentiation (i.e. plasticity). These cancer stem
cells are called tumour-initiating cells. Their definite existence
in acute leukaemias has been known for sometime and have
now been found to be present in some other malignant
tumours.
III.  CLINICAL AND GROSS FEATURES
Clinically, benign tumours are generally slow growing, and
depending upon the location, may remain asymptomatic (e.g.
subcutaneous lipoma), or may produce serious symptoms
(e.g. meningioma in the nervous system). On the other hand,
malignant tumours  grow rapidly, may ulcerate on the
surface, invade locally into deeper tissues, may spread to
distant sites (metastasis), and also produce systemic features
such as weight loss, anorexia and anemia.  In fact, two of the
cardinal clinical features of malignant tumours are:
invasiveness and metastasis (discussed later).
Gross appearance of benign and malignant tumours  may
be quite variable and the features may not be diagnostic on
the basis of gross appearance alone. However, certain
distinctive features characterise almost all tumours compared
to neighbouring normal tissue of origin—they have a
different colour, texture and consistency. Gross terms such
as papillary, fungating, infiltrating, haemorrhagic, ulcerative
and cystic are used to describe the macroscopic appearance
of the tumours. General gross features of benign and
malignant tumours are as under (Figs. 8.2 and 8.3):
Benign tumours are generally spherical or ovoid in shape.
They are encapsulated or well-circumscribed, freely movable,
more often firm and uniform, unless secondary changes like
haemorrhage or infarction supervene (Fig. 8.2,A, E).
Malignant tumours, on the other hand, are usually
irregular in shape, poorly-circumscribed and extend into the
adjacent tissues. Secondary changes like haemorrhage,
infarction and ulceration are seen more often. Sarcomas
typically have fish-flesh like consistency while carcinomas
are generally firm (Fig. 8.2,C, G).
IV.  MICROSCOPIC FEATURES
For recognising and classifying the tumours, the microscopic
characteristics of tumour cells are of greatest importance.
These features which are appreciated in histologic sections
are as under:
1.
microscopic pattern;
2.
cytomorphology of neoplastic cells (differentiation and
anaplasia);
3.
tumour angiogenesis and stroma; and
4.
inflammatory reaction.
1. Microscopic Pattern
The tumour cells may be arranged in a variety of patterns in
different tumours as under:
The epithelial tumours generally consist of acini, sheets,
columns or cords of epithelial tumour cells that may be
arranged in solid or papillary pattern (Fig. 8.2,B, D).
The mesenchymal tumours have mesenchymal tumour cells
arranged as interlacing bundles, fasicles or whorls, lying
separated from each other usually by the intercellular matrix
substance such as hyaline material in leiomyoma (Fig. 8.2,E),
cartilaginous matrix in chondroma, osteoid in osteosarcoma,
reticulin network in soft tissue sarcomas etc (Fig. 8.2,H).
Certain tumours have mixed patterns e.g. teratoma arising
from totipotent cells, pleomorphic adenoma of salivary gland
(mixed salivary tumour), fibroadenoma of the breast,
carcinosarcoma of the uterus and various other combinations
of tumour types.
Haematopoietic tumours such as leukaemias and
lymphomas often have none or little stromal support.
Generally, most benign tumours and low grade malignant
tumours reduplicate the normal structure of origin more
closely so that there is little difficulty in identifying and

197
CHAPTER 8
Neoplasia
classifying such tumours (Fig. 8.2,B, F). However, anaplastic
tumours differ greatly from the arrangement in normal tissue
of origin of the tumour and may occasionally pose problems
in classifying the tumour.
2. Cytomorphology of Neoplastic Cells
(Differentiation and Anaplasia)
The neoplastic cell is characterised by morphologic and
functional alterations, the most significant of which are
‘differentiation’ and ‘anaplasia’.
Differentiation is defined as the extent of morphological
and functional resemblance of parenchymal tumour cells to
corresponding normal cells. If the deviation of neoplastic cell
in structure and function is minimal as compared to normal
cell, the tumour is described as ‘well-differentiated’ such as
most benign and low-grade malignant tumours. ‘Poorly
differentiated’, ‘undifferentiated’ or ‘dedifferentiated’ are
synonymous terms for poor structural and functional
resemblance to corresponding normal cell.
Anaplasia is lack of differentiation and is a characteristic
feature of most malignant tumours. Depending upon the
degree of differentiation, the extent of anaplasia is also
variable i.e. poorly differentiated malignant tumours have
high degree of anaplasia.
As a result of anaplasia, noticeable morphological and
functional alterations in the neoplastic cells are observed.
These are considered below and are diagrammatically
illustrated in Fig. 8.4:
i) Loss of polarity. Normally, the nuclei of epithelial cells are
oriented along the basement membrane which is termed as
basal polarity. This property is based on cell adhesion
molecules, particularly selectins. Early in malignancy,
tumour cells lose their basal polarity so that the nuclei tend
to lie away from the basement membrane (Fig. 8.5).
ii) Pleomorphism. The term pleomorphism means variation
in size and shape of the tumour cells. The extent of cellular
pleomorphism generally correlates with the degree of
anaplasia. Tumour cells are often bigger than normal but in
some tumours they can be of normal size or smaller than
normal (Fig. 8.6).
iii) N:C ratio. Generally, the nuclei of malignant tumour cells
show more conspicuous changes. Nuclei are enlarged

with the appearance of an acinus (A).

198
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
disproportionate to the cell size so that the nucleocytoplasmic
ratio is increased from normal 1:5 to 1:1 (Fig. 8.6).
iv) Anisonucleosis. Just like cellular pleomorphism, the nuclei
too, show variation in size and shape in malignant tumour
cells (Fig. 8.6).
v) Hyperchromatism. Characteristically, the nuclear
chromatin of malignant cell is increased and coarsely
clumped. This is due to increase in the amount of
nucleoprotein resulting in dark-staining nuclei, referred to
as hyperchromatism (Fig. 8.6). Nuclear shape may vary,
nuclear membrane may be irregular and nuclear chromatin
is clumped along the nuclear membrane.
vi) Nucleolar changes. Malignant cells frequently have a
prominent nucleolus or nucleoli in the nucleus reflecting
increased nucleoprotein synthesis (Fig. 8.6). This may be
demonstrated as Nucleolar Organiser Region  (NOR) by
silver (Ag) staining called AgNOR material.
vii) Mitotic figures. The parenchymal cells of poorly-
differentiated tumours often show large number of mitoses
as compared with benign tumours and well-differentiated
malignant tumours. As stated above, these appear as either
normal or abnormal mitotic figures (Fig. 8.7):
Normal mitotic figures may be seen in some non-neoplastic
proliferating cells (e.g. haematopoietic cells of the bone
marrow, intestinal epithelium, hepatocytes etc), in certain
benign tumours and some low grade malignant tumours; in
sections they are seen as a dark band of dividing chromatin
at two poles of the nuclear spindle.
Abnormal or atypical mitotic figures are more important in
malignant tumours and are identified as tripolar, quadripolar
and multipolar spindles in malignant tumour cells.
viii) Tumour giant cells. Multinucleate  tumour giant cells or
giant cells containing a single large and bizarre nucleus,
possessing nuclear characters of the adjacent tumour cells,
are another important feature of anaplasia in malignant
tumours (Fig. 8.8).
ix) Functional (Cytoplasmic) changes. Structural anaplasia in
tumours is accompanied with functional anaplasia as
appreciated from the cytoplasmic constituents of the tumour
cells. The functional abnormality in neoplasms may be
quantitative, qualitative, or both.
Generally, benign tumours and better-differentiated
malignant tumours continue to function well qualitatively,
though there may be quantitative abnormality in the product
e.g. large or small amount of collagen produced by benign
tumours of fibrous tissue, keratin formation in well-
differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. In more anaplastic
tumours, there is usually quantitative fall in the product
made by the tumour cells e.g. absence of keratin in anaplastic
squamous cell carcinoma.
There may be both qualitative and quantitative abnormality
of the cellular function in some anaplastic tumours e.g.
multiple myeloma producing abnormal immunoglobulin in
large quantities.

CHAPTER 8
Neoplasia
Endocrine tumours may cause excessive hormone
production leading to characteristic clinical syndromes.
Besides the production of hormones by endocrine tumours,
hormones or hormone-like substances may be produced by
certain tumours quite unrelated to the endocrine glands. This
property of tumours is called ectopic hormone production e.g.
oat cell carcinoma of the lung can secrete ACTH and ADH;
less often it may produce gonadotropin, thyrotropin,
parathormone, calcitonin and growth hormone. Ectopic
erythropoietin may be produced by carcinoma of kidneys,
hepatocellular carcinoma and cerebellar haemangioblastoma.
x) Chromosomal abnormalities. All tumour cells have abnor-
mal genetic composition and on division they transmit the
genetic abnormality to their progeny. The chromosomal
abnormalities are more marked in more malignant tumours
which include deviations in both morphology and number
of chromosomes. Most malignant tumours show DNA aneu-
ploidy, often in the form of an increase in the number of
chromosomes, reflected morphologically by the increase in
the size of nuclei.
One of the most important examples of a consistent
chromosomal abnormality in human malignancy is the pre-
sence of Philadelphia chromosome (named after the city in
which it was first described) in 95% cases of chronic myeloid
leukaemia. In this, part of the long arm of chromosome 9 is
translocated to part of the long arm of chromosome 22 (t 9;
22). Other examples of neoplasms showing chromosomal
abnormalities are Burkitt’s lymphoma, acute lymphoid
leukaemia, multiple myeloma, retinoblastoma, oat cell
carcinoma, Wilms’ tumour etc.
3. Tumour Angiogenesis and Stroma
The connective tissue alongwith its vascular network forms
the supportive framework on which the parenchymal tumour
cells grow and receive nourishment. In addition to variable
amount of connective tissue and vascularity, the stroma may
have nerves and metaplastic bone or cartilage but no
lymphatics.
TUMOUR ANGIOGENESIS. In order to provide nourish-
ment to growing tumour, new blood vessels are formed from
pre-existing ones (angiogenesis). How this takes place under
the influence of angiogenic factors elaborated by tumour cells
such as vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) is
discussed later under molecular pathogenesis of cancer.
However, related morphologic features are as under:
i) Microvascular density. The new capillaries add to the
vascular density of the tumour which has been used as a
marker to assess the rate of growth of tumours and hence
grade the tumours. This is done by counting microvascular
density in the section of the tumour.
ii) Central necrosis. However, if the tumour outgrows its blood
supply as occurs in rapidly growing tumours or tumour
angiogenesis fails, its core undergoes ischaemic necrosis.
TUMOUR STROMA. The collagenous tissue in the stroma
may be scanty or excessive. In the former case, the tumour is
soft and fleshy (e.g. in sarcomas, lymphomas), while in the
latter case the tumour is hard and gritty (e.g. infiltrating duct
carcinoma breast). Growth of fibrous tissue in tumour is
stimulated by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)
elaborated by tumour cells.
If the epithelial tumour is almost entirely composed of
parenchymal cells, it is called medullary e.g. medullary
carcinoma of the breast (Fig. 8.9, A), medullary carcinoma
of the thyroid.
If there is excessive connective tissue stroma in the
epithelial tumour, it is referred to as desmoplasia and the
tumour is hard or scirrhous e.g. infiltrating duct carcinoma
breast (Fig. 8.9, B), linitis plastica of the stomach.
4. Inflammatory Reaction
At times, prominent inflammatory reaction is present in and
around the tumours. It could be the result of ulceration in
the cancer when there is secondary infection. The
inflammatory reaction in such instances may be acute or
chronic. However, some tumours show chronic inflammatory
reaction, chiefly of lymphocytes, plasma cells and

SECTION I

macrophages, and in some instances granulomatous reaction,
in the absence of ulceration. This is due to cell-mediated
immunologic response by the host in an attempt to destroy
the tumour. In some cases, such an immune response
improves the prognosis.
The examples of such reaction are: seminoma testis
(Fig. 8.10), malignant melanoma of the skin, lympho-
epithelioma of the throat, medullary carcinoma of the breast,
choriocarcinoma, Warthin’s tumour of salivary glands etc.
V.  LOCAL INVASION (DIRECT SPREAD)
BENIGN TUMOURS. Most benign tumours form
encapsulated or circumscribed masses that expand and push
aside the surrounding normal tissues without actually
invading, infiltrating or metastasising.
MALIGNANT TUMOURS. Malignant tumours also enlarge
by expansion and some well-differentiated tumours may be
partially encapsulated as well e.g. follicular carcinoma
thyroid. But characteristically, they are distinguished from
benign tumours by invasion, infiltration and destruction of the
surrounding tissue, besides distant metastasis (described
below). In general, tumours invade via the route of least
resistance, though eventually most cancers recognise no
anatomic boundaries. Often, cancers extend through tissue
spaces, permeate lymphatics, blood vessels, perineural
spaces and may penetrate a bone by growing through
nutrient foramina. More commonly, the tumours invade thin-
walled capillaries and veins than thick-walled arteries. Dense
compact collagen, elastic tissue and cartilage are some of the
tissues which are sufficiently resistant to invasion by
tumours.
Mechanism of invasion of malignant tumours is discussed
together with that of metastasis below.
VI.  METASTASIS (DISTANT SPREAD)
Metastasis (meta = transformation, stasis = residence) is
defined as spread of tumour by invasion in such a way that
discontinuous secondary tumour mass/masses are formed
at the site of lodgement. Metastasis and invasiveness are the
two most important features to distinguish malignant from benign
tumours: benign tumours do not metastasise while all the
malignant tumours with a few exceptions like gliomas of the
central nervous system and basal cell carcinoma of the skin,
can metastasise. Generally, larger, more aggressive and
rapidly-growing tumours are more likely to metastasise but
there are numerous exceptions. About one-third of malignant
tumours at presentation have evident metastatic deposits
while another 20% have occult metastasis.
Routes of Metastasis
Cancers may spread to distant sites by following pathways:
1.
Lymphatic spread
2.
Haematogenous spread
3.
Spread along body cavities and natural passages
(Transcoelomic spread, along epithelium-lined surfaces,
spread via cerebrospinal fluid, implantation).
1.
LYMPHATIC SPREAD. In general, carcinomas metastasise
by lymphatic route while sarcomas favour haematogenous route.
However, sarcomas may also spread by lymphatic pathway.
The involvement of lymph nodes by malignant cells may be
of two forms:
i) Lymphatic permeation. The walls of lymphatics are readily
invaded by cancer cells and may form a continuous growth
in the lymphatic channels called lymphatic permeation.
ii) Lymphatic emboli. Alternatively, the malignant cells may
detach to form tumour emboli so as to be carried along the
lymph to the next draining lymph node. The tumour emboli
enter the lymph node at its convex surface and are lodged in
the subcapsular sinus where they start growing (Fig. 8.11).
Later, of course, the whole lymph node may be replaced and
enlarged by the metastatic tumour (Fig. 8.12).
Generally, regional lymph nodes draining the tumour are
invariably involved producing regional nodal metastasis e.g.
from carcinoma breast to axillary lymph nodes, from
carcinoma thyroid to lateral cervical lymph nodes,
bronchogenic carcinoma to hilar and para-tracheal lymph
nodes etc.
However, all regional nodal enlargements are not due to
nodal metastasis because necrotic products of tumour and
antigens may also incite regional lymphadenitis of sinus
histiocytosis.
Sometimes lymphatic metastases do not develop first in
the lymph node nearest to the tumour because of venous-
lymphatic anastomoses or due to obliteration of lymphatics
by inflammation or radiation, so called skip metastasis.
Other times, due to obstruction of the lymphatics by
tumour cells, the lymph flow is disturbed and tumour cells
spread against the flow of lymph causing  retrograde metastases
at unusual sites e.g. metastasis of carcinoma prostate to the
supraclavicular lymph nodes, metastatic deposits from
bronchogenic carcinoma to the axillary lymph nodes.
Virchow’s lymph node is nodal metastasis preferentially
to supraclavicular lymph node from cancers of abdominal
organs e.g. cancer stomach, colon, and gall bladder.

201
CHAPTER 8
Neoplasia
It is believed that lymph nodes in the vicinity of tumour
perform multiple roles—as initial barrier filter, and in
destruction of tumour cells, while later provide fertile soil
for growth of tumour cells.
Mechanism of lymphatic route of metastasis is discussed
later under biology of invasion and metastasis.
2.
HAEMATOGENOUS SPREAD. Blood-borne metastasis is
the common route for sarcomas but certain carcinomas also
frequently metastasise by this mode, especially those of the lung,
breast, thyroid, kidney, liver, prostate and ovary. The sites
where blood-borne metastasis commonly occurs are: the
liver, lungs, brain, bones, kidney and adrenals, all of which
provide ‘good soil’ for the growth of ‘good seeds’ (seed-soil
theory). However, a few organs such as spleen, heart, and
skeletal muscle generally do not allow tumour metastasis to
grow. Spleen is unfavourable site due to open sinusoidal
pattern which does not permit tumour cells to stay there long
enough to produce metastasis. In general, only a proportion
of cancer cells are capable of clonal proliferation in the proper
environment; others die without establishing a metastasis.
Systemic veins drain blood into vena cavae from limbs,
head and neck and pelvis. Therefore, cancers of these sites
more often metastasise to the lungs.
Portal veins drain blood from the bowel, spleen and
pancreas into the liver. Thus, tumours of these organs
frequently have secondaries in the liver.
Arterial spread of tumours is less likely because they are
thick-walled and contain elastic tissue which is resistant to
invasion. Nevertheless, arterial spread may occur when
tumour cells pass through pulmonary capillary bed or
through pulmonary arterial branches which have thin walls.
Cancer of the lung may, however, metastasise by pulmonary
arterial route to kidneys, adrenals, bones, brain etc.
Retrograde spread by blood route may occur at unusual
sites due to retrograde spread after venous obstruction, just
Figure 8.11

as with lymphatic metastases. Important examples are
vertebral metastases in cancers of the thyroid and prostate.
Grossly, blood-borne metastases in an organ appear as
multiple, rounded nodules of varying size, scattered
throughout the organ (Fig. 8.13). Sometimes, the
metastasis may grow bigger than the primary tumour. At
times, metastatic deposits may come to attention first
without an evident primary tumour. In such cases search
for primary tumour may be rewarding, but rarely the
primary tumour may remain undetected or occult.
Metastatic deposits just like primary tumour may cause
further dissemination via lymphatics and blood vessels
(Fig. 8.14, A).
Microscopically, the secondary deposits generally
reproduce the structure of primary tumour (Fig. 8.14, B).
However, the same primary tumour on metastasis at
different sites may show varying grades of differentiation,
apparently due to the influence of local environment
surrounding the tumour for its growth.
3.
SPREAD ALONG BODY CAVITIES AND NATURAL
PASSAGES. Uncommonly, some cancers may spread by
seeding across body cavities and natural passages. These
routes of distant spread are as under:
i)
Transcoelomic spread. Certain cancers invade through
the serosal wall of the coelomic cavity so that tumour

CHAPTER 8
Neoplasia
fragments or clusters of tumour cells break off to be carried
in the coelomic fluid and are implanted elsewhere in the body
cavity. Peritoneal cavity is involved most often, but
occasionally pleural and pericardial cavities are also affected.
A few examples of transcoelomic spread are as follows:
a) Carcinoma of the stomach seeding to both ovaries
(Krukenberg tumour).
b) Carcinoma of the ovary spreading to the entire peritoneal
cavity without infiltrating the underlying organs.
c)
Pseudomyxoma peritonei is the gelatinous coating of the
peritoneum from mucin-secreting carcinoma of the ovary or
apppendix.
d) Carcinoma of the bronchus and breast seeding to the pleura
and pericardium.
ii) Spread along epithelium-lined surfaces. It is unusual
for a malignant tumour to spread along the epithelium-lined
surfaces because intact epithelium and mucus coat are quite
resistant to penetration by tumour cells. However,
exceptionally a malignant tumour may spread through:
a) the fallopian tube from the endometrium to the ovaries or
vice-versa;
b) through the bronchus into alveoli; and
c) through the ureters from the kidneys into lower urinary
tract.
iii) Spread via cerebrospinal fluid. Malignant tumour of the
ependyma and leptomeninges may spread by release of
tumour fragments and tumour cells into the CSF and produce
metastases at other sites in the central nervous system.
iv) Implantation. Rarely, a tumour may spread by
implantation by surgeon’s scalpel, needles, sutures, or may
be implanted by direct contact such as transfer of cancer of
the lower lip to the apposing upper lip.
MECHANISM AND BIOLOGY OF
INVASION AND METASTASIS
The process of local invasion and distant spread by lymphatic
and haematogenous routes discussed above involves passage
through barriers before gaining access to the vascular lumen.
This includes making the passage by the cancer cells by
dissolution of extracellular matrix (ECM) at three levels— at
the basement membrane of tumour itself, at the level of
interstitial connective tissue, and at the basement membrane
of microvasculature. The following steps are involved at the
molecular level which are schematically illustrated in
Fig. 8.15.
1.
Aggressive clonal proliferation and angiogenesis. The
first step in the spread of cancer cells is the development of
rapidly proliferating clone of cancer cells. This is explained
on the basis of tumour heterogeneity, i.e. in the population of
monoclonal tumour cells, a subpopulation or clone of tumour
cells has the right biologic characteristics to complete the
steps involved in the development of metastasis. Tumour
angiogenesis plays a very significant role in metastasis since
the new vessels formed as part of growing tumour are more
vulnerable to invasion as these evolving vessels are directly
in contact with cancer cells.
2.
Tumour cell loosening. Normal cells remain glued to
each other due to presence of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)
i.e.E (epithelial)-cadherin. In epithelial cancers, there is either
loss or inactivation of E-cadherin and also other CAMs of
immunoglobulin superfamily, all of which results in
loosening of cancer cells.
3.
Tumour cell-ECM interaction. Loosened cancer cells are
now attached to ECM proteins, mainly laminin and fibronectin.
This attachment is facilitated due to profoundness of
receptors on the cancer cells for both these proteins. There is
also loss of integrins, the transmembrane receptors, further
favouring invasion.
Figure 8.15
Mechanism and biology of local invasion and
metastasis. The serial numbers in the figure correspond to their
description in the text.

204
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
4.
Degradation of ECM. Tumour cells overexpress proteases
and matrix-degrading enzymes, metalloproteinases, that
includes collagenases and gelatinase, while the inhibitors of
metalloproteinases are decreased. Another protease,
cathepsin D, is also increased in certain cancers. These
enzymes bring about dissolution of ECM—firstly basement
membrane of tumour itself, then make way for tumour cells
through the interstitial matrix, and finally dissolve the
basement membrane of the vessel wall.
5.
Entry of tumour cells into capillary lumen. The tumour
cells after degrading the basement membrane are ready to
migrate into lumen of capillaries or venules for which the
following mechanisms play a role:
i)
Autocrine motility factor (AMF) is a cytokine derived from
tumour cells and stimulates receptor-mediated motility of
tumour cells.
ii) Cleavage products of matrix components which are formed
following degradation of ECM have properties of tumour
cell chemotaxis, growth promotion and angiogenesis in the
cancer.
After the malignant cells have migrated through the
breached basement membrane, these cells enter the lumen
of  lymphatic and capillary channels.
6.
Thrombus formation. The tumour cells protruding in the
lumen of the capillary are now covered with constituents of
the circulating blood and form the thrombus. Thrombus
provides nourishment to the tumour cells and also protects
them from the immune attack by the circulating host cells.
In fact, normally a large number of tumour cells are released
into circulation but they are attacked by the host immune
cells. Actually a very small proportion of malignant cells (less
than 0.1%) in the blood stream survive to develop into
metastasis.
7.
Extravasation of tumour cells. Tumour cells in the
circulation (capillaries, venules, lymphatics) may
mechanically block these vascular channels and attach to
vascular endothelium. In this way, the sequence similar to
local invasion is repeated and the basement membrane in
exposed.
8.
Survival and growth of metastatic deposit. The extra-
vasated malignant cells on lodgement in the right
environment grow further under the influence of growth
factors produced by host tissues, tumour cells and by
cleavage products of matrix components. These growth
factors in particular include: PDGF, FGF, TGF-β and VEGF.
The metastatic deposits grow further if the host immune
defense mechanism fails to eliminate it. Metastatic deposits
may further metastasise to the same organ or to other sites
by forming emboli.
PROGNOSTIC MARKERS
Metastasis is a common event in malignant tumours which
greatly reduces the survival of patient. In the biology of
tumour, metastasis is a form of unusual cell differentiation
in which the tumour cells form disorderly masses at ectopic
sites and start growing there. This random phenomenon
takes place in a stepwise manner involving only a
subpopulation of tumour cells selectively. The process is
governed by inappropriate expression of genes which normally
partake in physiologic processes i.e. it is a genetically prog-
rammed phenomenon.
Recent evidence has shown that in metastatic tumours,
survival of host is correlated with some clinical and molecular
features of tumours which act as prognostic markers. These
are as under:
i)
Clinical prognostic markers: Size, grade, vascular
invasion and nodal involvement by the tumour.
ii) Molecular prognostic markers: Molecular markers indi-
cative of poor prognosis in certain specific tumours are:
a) expression of an oncogene by tumour cells (C-met);
b) CD 44 molecule;
c)
oestrogen receptors;
d) epidermal growth factor receptor;
e) angiogenesis factors and degree of neovascularisation;
and
f)
expression of metastasis associated gene or nucleic acid
(MAGNA) in the DNA fragment in metastasising tumour.
GRADING AND STAGING OF CANCER
‘Grading’ and ‘staging’ are the two systems to predict tumour
behaviour and guide therapy after a malignant tumour is
detected. Grading is defined as the gross and microscopic degree
of differentiation of the tumour, while staging means extent of
spread of the tumour within the patient. Thus, grading is
histologic while staging is clinical.
Grading
Cancers may be graded grossly and microscopically. Gross
features like exophytic or fungating appearance are
indicative of less malignant growth than diffusely infiltrating
tumours. However, grading is largely based on 2 important
histologic features: the degree of anaplasia, and the rate of growth.
Based on these features, cancers are categorised from
grade I as the most differentiated, to grade III or IV as the
most undifferentiated or anaplastic. Many systems of grading
have been proposed but the one described by Broders for
dividing squamous cell carcinoma into 4 grades depending
upon the degree of differentiation is followed for other
malignant tumours as well. Broders’ grading is as under:
Grade I: Well-differentiated (less than 25% anaplastic cells).
Grade II: Moderately-differentiated (25-50% anaplastic cells).
Grade III: Moderately-differentiated (50-75% anaplastic cells).
Grade IV: Poorly-differentiated or anaplastic (more than 75%
anaplastic cells).
However, grading of tumours has several shortcomings.
It is subjective and the degree of differentiation may vary
from one area of tumour to the other. Therefore, it is common
practice with pathologists to grade cancers in descriptive
terms (e.g. well-differentiated, undifferentiated, keratinising,
non-keratinising etc) rather than giving the tumours grade
numbers.
More objective criteria for histologic grading include use
of flow cytometry for mitotic cell counts, cell proliferation

markers  by immunohistochemistry, and by applying image
morphometry for cancer cell and nuclear parameters.
Staging
The extent of spread of cancers can be assessed by 3 ways—
by clinical examination, by investigations, and by pathologic
examination of the tissue removed. Two important staging
systems currently followed are: TNM staging and AJC
staging.
TNM staging. (T for primary tumour, N for regional nodal
involvement, and M for distant metastases) was developed
by the UICC (Union Internationale Contre Cancer, Geneva).
For each of the 3 components namely T, N and M, numbers
are added to indicate the extent of involvement, as under:
T0 to T4: In situ lesion to largest and most extensive
primary tumour.
N0 to N3: No nodal involvement to widespread lymph
node involvement.
M0 to M2: No metastasis to disseminated haematogenous
metastases.
AJC staging. American Joint Committee staging divides all
cancers into stage 0 to IV, and takes into account all the
3 components of the preceding system (primary tumour,
nodal involvement and distant metastases) in each stage.
TNM and AJC staging systems can be applied for staging
most malignant tumours.
Currently, clinical staging of tumours does not rest on
routine radiography (X-ray, ultrasound) and exploratory
surgery but more modern techniques are available by which
it is possible to ‘stage’ a malignant tumour by non-invasive
techniques. These include use of computed tomography (CT)
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan based on tissue
density for locating the local extent of tumour and its spread
to other organs. More recently, availability of positron
emission tomography (PET) scan has overcome the limitation
of CT and MRI scan because PET scan facilitates distinction
of benign and malignant tumour on the basis of biochemical
and molecular processes in tumours. Radioactive tracer
studies in vivo such as use of iodine isotope 125 bound to
specific tumour antibodies is another method by which small
number of tumour cells in the body can be detected by
imaging of tracer substance bound to specific tumour antigen.
EPIDEMIOLOGY AND
PREDISPOSITION TO NEOPLASIA
CANCER INCIDENCE
The overall incidence of cancer in a population or a country
is known by registration of all cancer cases (cancer registry)
and by rate of death from cancer. Worldwide, it is estimated
that about 20% of all deaths are cancer-related; in US, cancer
is the second most common cause of deaths, next to heart
disease. There have been changing patterns in incidence of
cancers in both the sexes and in different geographic locations
as outlined below. Table 8.3 shows worldwide incidence (in
descending order) of different forms of cancer in men,
women, and children. As evident from the Table, some types
of cancers are more common in India while others are
commoner in the Western populations since etiologic factors
are different.
In general, most common cancers in the developed and
developing countries are as under:
Developed world: lung, breast, prostate and colorectal.
Developing world: liver, cervical and oesophageal.
About one-third of all cancers worldwide are attributed
to 9 modifiable life-style factors: tobacco use, alcohol
consumption, obesity, physical inactivity, low fiber diet,
unprotected sex, polluted air, indoor household smoke, and
contaminated injections. Overall, there has been a declining
trend in incidence of some of the cancers due to cancer
screening programmes for cervical, breast, colorectal and
prostate cancer.
EPIDEMIOLOGIC FACTORS
A lot of clinical and experimental research and epidemio-
logical studies have been carried out in the field of oncology
so as to know the possible causes of cancer and mechanisms
involved in transformation of a normal cell into a neoplastic
cell. It is widely known that no single factor is responsible
for development of tumours. The role of some factors in
causation of neoplasia is established while that of others is
epidemiological and many others are still unknown.
Besides the etiologic role of some agents discussed later,
the pattern and incidence of cancer depends upon the
following:
A) A large number of predisposing epidemiologic factors or
cofactors which include a number of endogenous host factors
and exogenous environmental factors.
B) Chronic non-neoplastic (pre-malignant) conditions.
C) Role of hormones in cancer.
A. Predisposing Factors
1.
FAMILIAL AND GENETIC FACTORS. It has long been
suspected that familial predisposition and heredity play a
role in the development of cancers. In general, the risk of
developing cancer in relatives of a known cancer patient is
almost three times higher as compared to control subjects.
Some of the cancers with familial occurrence are colon, breast,
ovary, brain and melanoma. Familial cancers occur at a
relatively early age, appear at multiple sites and occur in 2
or more close relatives. The overall estimates suggest that
genetic cancers comprise not greater than 5% of all cancers.
Some of the common examples are as under:
i)
Retinoblastoma. About 40% of retinoblastomas are
familial and show an autosomal dominant inheritance.

iv) South-East Asians, especially of Chinese origin develop
nasopharyngeal cancer more commonly.
v) Indians of both sexes have higher incidence of carcinoma
of the oral cavity and upper aerodigestive tract, while in
females carcinoma of uterine cervix and of the breast run
parallel in incidence. Cancer of the liver in India is more often
due to viral hepatitis (HBV and HCV) and subsequent
cirrhosis, while in western populations it is more often due
to alcoholic cirrhosis.
3.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND CULTURAL FACTORS.
Surprising as it may seem, we are surrounded by an
environment of carcinogens which we eat, drink, inhale and
touch. Some of the examples are given below:
i)
Cigarette smoking is the single most important environ-
mental factor implicated in the etiology of cancer of the oral
cavity, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, lungs, pancreas and
urinary bladder.
ii) Alcohol abuse predisposes to the development of cancer
of oropharynx, larynx, oesophagus and liver.
iii) Alcohol and tobacco together further accentuate the risk
of developing cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract.
iv) Cancer of the cervix is linked to a number of factors such
as age at first coitus, frequency of coitus, multiplicity of
partners, parity etc. Sexual partners of circumcised males
have lower incidence of cervical cancer than the partners of
uncircumcised males.
v) Penile cancer is rare in the Jews and Muslims as they are
customarily circumcised. Carcinogenic component of
smegma appears to play a role in the etiology of penile cancer.
vi) Betel nut cancer of the cheek and tongue is quite common
in some parts of India due to habitual practice of keeping
the bolus of paan in a particular place in mouth for a long
time.
vii) A large number of industrial and environmental
substances are carcinogenic and are occupational hazard for
some populations. These include exposure to substances like
arsenic, asbestos, benzene, vinyl chloride, naphthylamine etc.
viii) Certain constituents of diet have also been implicated
in the causation of cancer. Overweight individuals, deficiency
of vitamin A and people consuming diet rich in animal fats
and low in fibre content are more at risk of developing certain
cancers such as colonic cancer. Diet rich in vitamin E, on the
other hand, possibly has some protective influence by its
antioxidant action.
4.
AGE. The most significant risk factor for cancer is age.
Generally, cancers occur in older individuals past 5th decade
of life (two-third of all cancers occur above 65 years of age),
though there are variations in age incidence in different forms
of cancers. It is not clear whether higher incidence of cancer
in advanced age is due to alteration in the cells of the host,
longer exposure to the effect of carcinogen, or decreased
ability of the host immune response. Some tumours have
two peaks of incidence e.g. acute leukaemias occur in children
and in older age group. The biologic behaviour of tumours
in children does not always correlate with histologic features.
Carriers of such genetic composition have 10,000 times higher
risk of developing retinoblastoma which is often bilateral.
Such patients are predisposed to develop another primary
malignant tumour, notably osteogenic sarcoma.
Familial form of retinoblastoma is due to missing of a
portion of chromosome 13 where RB gene is normally located.
This results in a genetic defect of absence of RB gene, the
first ever tumour suppressor gene identified. An absent RB
gene predisposes an individual to retinoblastoma but cancer
develops when other copy of RB gene from the other parent
is also defective.
ii) Familial polyposis coli. This condition has autosomal
dominant inheritance. The polypoid adenomas may be seen
at birth or in early age. By the age of 50 years, almost 100%
cases of familial polyposis coli develop cancer of the colon.
iii) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN). A combination of
adenomas of pituitary, parathyroid and pancreatic islets
(MEN-I) or syndrome of medullary carcinoma thyroid,
pheochromocytoma and parathyroid tumour (MEN-II) are
encountered in families.
iv) Neurofibromatosis or von Recklinghausen’s disease.
This condition is characterised by multiple neurofibromas
and pigmented skin spots (cafe au lait spots). These patients
have family history consistent with autosomal dominant
inheritance in 50% of patients.
v) Cancer of the breast. Female relatives of breast cancer
patients have 2 to 6 times higher risk of developing breast
cancer. Inherited breast cancer comprises about 5-10% of all
breast cancers. As discussed later, there are two breast cancer
susceptibility genes, BRCA-1 and BRCA-2. Mutations in these
genes appear in about 3% cases and these patients have about
85% risk of development of breast cancer.
vi) DNA-chromosomal instability syndromes. These are a
group of pre-neoplastic conditions having defect in DNA
repair mechanism. A classical example is xeroderma
pigmentosum, an autosomal recessive disorder,
characterised by extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation.
The patients may develop various types of skin cancers such
as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and
malignant melanoma.
2.
RACIAL AND GEOGRAPHIC FACTORS. Differences
in racial incidence of some cancers may be partly attributed
to the role of genetic composition but are largely due to
influence of the environment and geographic differences
affecting the whole population such as climate, soil, water,
diet, habits, customs etc. Some of the examples of racial and
geographic variations in various cancers are as under:
i)
White Europeans and Americans develop most
commonly malignancies of the lung, breast, and colon. Liver
cancer is uncommon in these races. Breast cancer is
uncommon in Japanese women but is more common in
American women.
ii) Black Africans, on the other hand, have more commonly
cancers of the skin, penis, cervix and liver.
iii) Japanese have five times higher incidence of carcinoma
of the stomach than the Americans.

207
CHAPTER 8
Neoplasia
Besides acute leukaemias, other tumours in infancy and
childhood are: neuroblastoma, nephroblastoma (Wilms’
tumour), retinoblastoma, hepatoblastoma, rhabdomyo-
sarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma, teratoma and CNS tumours.
5.
SEX.  Apart from the malignant tumours of organs
peculiar to each sex, most tumours are generally more
common in men than in women except cancer of the breast,
gall bladder, thyroid and hypopharynx. Although there are
geographic and racial variations, cancer of the breast is the
commonest cancer in women throughout the world while lung
cancer is the commonest cancer in men. The differences in
incidence of certain cancers in the two sexes may be related
to the presence of specific sex hormones.
B. Chronic Non-neoplastic (Pre-malignant)  Conditions
Premalignant lesions are a group of conditions which
predispose to the subsequent development of cancer. Such
conditions are important to recognise so as to prevent the
subsequent occurrence of an invasive cancer. Many of these
conditions are characterised by morphologic changes in the
cells such as increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio,
pleomorphism of cells and nuclei, increased mitotic activity,
poor differentiation, and sometimes accompanied by chronic
inflammatory cells.
Some examples of premalignant lesions are given below:
1.
Carcinoma in situ (intraepithelial neoplasia). When the
cytological features of malignancy are present but the
malignant cells are confined to epithelium without invasion
across the basement membrane, it is called as carcinoma
in situ or intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The common sites
are as under:
i)
Uterine cervix at the junction of ecto- and endocervix
(Fig. 8.16)
ii) Bowen’s disease of the skin
iii) Actinic or solar keratosis
iv) Oral leukoplakia
v) Intralobular and intraductal carcinoma of the breast.
The area involved in carcinoma in situ may be single and
small, or multifocal. As regards the behaviour of CIN, it may
regress and return to normal or may develop into invasive
cancer. In some instances such as in cervical cancer, there is
a sequential transformation from squamous metaplasia, to
epithelial dysplasia, to carcinoma in situ, and eventually to
invasive cancer.
2.
Some benign tumours. Commonly, benign tumours do
not become malignant. However, there are some exceptions
e.g.
i)
Multiple villous adenomas of the large intestine have high
incidence of developing adenocarcinoma.
ii) Neurofibromatosis (von Recklinghausen’s disease) may
develop into sarcoma.
3.
Miscellaneous conditions. Certain inflammatory and
hyperplastic conditions are prone to development of cancer,
e.g.
i)
Patients of long-standing ulcerative colitis are predis-
posed to develop colorectal cancer.
ii) Cirrhosis of the liver has predisposition to develop
hepatocellular carcinoma.
iii) Chronic bronchitis in heavy cigarette smokers may
develop cancer of the bronchus.
iv) Chronic irritation from jagged tooth or ill-fitting denture
may lead to cancer of the oral cavity.
v) Squamous cell carcinoma developing in an old burn scar
(Marjolin’s ulcer).
C. Hormones and Cancer
Cancer is more likely to develop in organs and tissues which
undergo proliferation under the influence of excessive
hormonal stimulation. On cessation of hormonal stimulation,
such tissues become atrophic. Hormone-sensitive tissues
developing tumours are the breast, endometrium,
myometrium, vagina, thyroid, liver, prostate and testis. Some
examples of hormones influencing carcinogenesis in
experimental animals and humans are given below:
1.
OESTROGEN. Examples of oestrogen-induced cancers
are as under:
i)
In experimental animals. Induction of breast cancer in
mice by administration of high-dose of oestrogen and
reduction of the tumour development following oophorec-
tomy is the most important example. It has been known that
associated infection with mouse mammary tumour virus
(MMTV, Bittner milk factor) has an added influence on the
development of breast cancer in mice. Other cancers which
can be experimentally induced in mice by oestrogens are
squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, connective tissue
tumour of the myometrium, Leydig cell tumour of the testis
in male mice, tumour of the kidney in hamsters, and benign
as well as malignant tumours of the liver in rats.
ii) In humans. Women receiving oestrogen therapy and
women with oestrogen-secreting granulosa cell tumour of
the ovary have increased risk of developing endometrial
carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma of the vagina is seen with
increased frequency in adolescent daughters of mothers who
had received oestrogen therapy during pregnancy.

dysplastic squamous cells are confined to all the layers of the mucosa
but the basement membrane on which these layers rest is intact.

208

General Pathology and Basic Techniques
2.
CONTRACEPTIVE HORMONES. The sequential types
of oral contraceptives increase the risk of developing breast
cancer. Other tumours showing a slightly increased
frequency in women receiving contraceptive pills for long
durations are benign tumours of the liver, and a few patients
have been reported to have developed hepatocellular
carcinoma.
3.
ANABOLIC STEROIDS. Consumption of anabolic
steroids by athletes to increase the muscle mass is not only
unethical athletic practice but also increases the risk of
developing benign and malignant tumours of the liver.
4.
HORMONE-DEPENDENT TUMOURS. It has been
shown in experimental animals that induction of hyper-
function of adenohypophysis is associated with increased
risk of developing neoplasia of the target organs following
preceding functional hyperplasia. There is tumour regression
on removal of the stimulus for excessive hormonal secretion.
A few examples of such phenomena are seen in humans:
i)
Prostatic cancer usually responds to the administration of
oestrogens.
ii) Breast cancer may regress with oophorectomy, hypo-
physectomy or on administration of male hormones.
iii) Thyroid cancer may slow down in growth with adminis-
tration of thyroxine that suppresses the secretion of TSH by
the pituitary.
CARCINOGENESIS: ETIOLOGY AND
PATHOGENESIS OF CANCER
Carcinogenesis or oncogenesis or tumorigenesis means
mechanism of induction of tumours (pathogenesis of cancer);
agents which can induce tumours are called carcinogens
(etiology of cancer). Since the time first ever carcinogen was
identified, there has been ever-increasing list of agents
implicated in etiology of cancer. There has been still greater
accumulation in volumes of knowledge on pathogenesis of
cancer, especially due to tremendous strides made in the field
of molecular biology and genetics in recent times.
The subject of etiology and pathogenesis of cancer is
discussed under the following 4 broad headings:
A. Molecular pathogenesis of cancer (genes and cancer)
B. Chemical carcinogens and chemical carcinogenesis
C. Physical carcinogens and radiation carcinogenesis
D. Biologic carcinogens and viral oncogenesis.
A. MOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS OF CANCER
(GENETIC MECHANISMS OF CANCER)
Basic Concept of Molecular Pathogenesis
The mechanism as to how a normal cell is transformed to a
cancer cell is complex. At different times, attempts have been
made to unravel this mystery by various mechanisms.
Currently, a lot of literature has accumulated to explain the
pathogenesis of cancer at molecular level. The general
concept of molecular mechanisms of cancer is briefly outlined
below and diagrammatically shown in Fig. 8.17.
1.
Monoclonality of tumours. There is strong evidence to
support that most human cancers arise from a single clone
of cells by genetic transformation or mutation. For example:
i)
In a case of multiple myeloma (a malignant disorder of
plasma cells), there is production of a single type of immuno-
globulin or its chain as seen by monoclonal spike in serum
electrophoresis.
ii) Due to inactivation of one of the two X-chromosomes in
females (paternal or maternal derived), women are mosaics
with two types of cell populations for glucose-6-phosphatase
dehydrogenase (G6PD) isoenzyme  A and B.  It is observed
that all the tumour cells in benign uterine tumours
(leiomyoma) contain either A or B genotype of G6PD (i.e.
the tumour cells are derived from a single progenitor clone
of cell), while the normal myometrial cells are mosaic of both
types of cells derived from A as well as B isoenzyme
(Fig. 8.18).
2.
Field theory of cancer. In an organ developing cancer, in
the backdrop of normal cells, limited number of cells only
grow in to cancer after undergoing sequence of changes
under the influence of etiologic agents. This is termed as ‘field
effect’ and the concept called as field theory of cancer.
3.
Multi-step process of cancer growth and progression.
Carcinogenesis is a gradual multi-step process involving
many generations of cells. The various causes may act on
the cell one after another (multi-hit process). The same process
is also involved in further progression of the tumour.
Figure 8.17
Schematic illustration to show molecular basis of cancer.

209
CHAPTER 8
Neoplasia
Ultimately, the cells so formed are genetically and
phenotypically transformed cells having phenotypic features
of malignancy—excessive growth, invasiveness and distant
metastasis.
4.
Genetic theory of cancer. Cell growth of normal as well
as abnormal types is under genetic control. In cancer, there
are either genetic abnormalities in the cell, or there are normal
genes with abnormal expression. The abnormalities in genetic
composition may be from inherited or induced mutations
(induced by etiologic carcinogenic agents namely: chemicals,
viruses, radiation). The mutated cells transmit their
characters to the next progeny of cells and result in cancer.
5.
Genetic regulators of normal and abnormal mitosis. In
normal cell growth, regulatory genes control mitosis as well
as cell aging, terminating in cell death by apoptosis.
In normal cell growth, there are 4 regulatory genes:
i) Proto-oncogenes are growth-promoting genes i.e. they
encode for cell proliferation pathway.
ii) Anti-oncogenes are growth-inhibiting or growth suppressor
genes.
iii) Apoptosis regulatory genes control the programmed cell
death.
iv) DNA repair genes are those normal genes which regulate
the repair of DNA damage that has occurred during mitosis
and also control the damage to proto-oncogenes and anti-
oncogenes.
In cancer, the transformed cells are produced by
abnormal cell growth due to genetic damage to these normal
controlling genes. Thus, corresponding abnormalities in these
4 cell regulatory genes are as under:
i) Activation of growth-promoting oncogenes causing
transformation of cell (mutant form of normal proto-
oncogene in cancer is termed oncogene). Many of these cancer
associated genes, oncogenes, were first discovered in viruses,
and hence named as v-onc. Gene products of oncogenes are
called oncoproteins. Oncogenes are considered dominant since
they appear in spite of presence of normal proto-oncogenes.
ii) Inactivation of cancer-suppressor genes (i.e. inactivation of
anti-oncogenes) permitting the cellular proliferation of
transformed cells. Anti-oncogenes are active in recessive form
i.e. they are active only if both alleles are damaged.
iii) Abnormal apoptosis regulatory genes which may act as
oncogenes or anti-oncogenes. Accordingly, these genes may
be active in dominant or recessive form.
iv) Failure of DNA repair genes and thus inability to repair the
DNA damage resulting in mutations.
Cancer-related Genes and Cell Growth
(Hallmarks of Cancer)
It is apparent from the above discussion that genes control
the normal cellular growth, while in cancer these controlling
genes are altered, typically by mutations. A large number of
such cancer-associated genes have been described, each with
a specific function in cell growth. Some of these genes are
commonly associated in many tumours (e.g. p53 or TP53),
while others are specific to particular tumours. Therefore, it
is considered appropriate to discuss the role of cancer-related
genes with regard to their functions in cellular growth.
Following are the major genetic properties or hallmarks of cancer:
1.
Excessive and autonomous growth: Growth-promoting
oncogenes.
2.
Refractoriness to growth inhibition: Growth suppressing
anti-oncogenes.
3.
Escaping cell death by apoptosis: Genes regulating
apoptosis and cancer.
4.
Avoiding cellular aging: Telomeres and telomerase in
cancer.
5.
Continued perfusion of cancer: Cancer angiogenesis.
6.
Invasion and distant metastasis: Cancer dissemination.
7.
DNA damage and repair system: Mutator genes and
cancer.
8.
Cancer progression and tumour heterogeneity: Clonal
aggressiveness.
9.
Cancer a sequential multistep molecular phenomenon:
Multistep theory.
10. MicroRNAs in cancer: OncomiRs.
These properties of cancer cells are described below in
terms of molecular genetics and schematically illustrated in
Fig. 8.19.
1. EXCESSIVE AND AUTONOMOUS GROWTH:
GROWTH PROMOTING ONCOGENES
Mutated form of normal protooncogenes in cancer is called
oncogenes. Protooncogenes become activated oncogenes by
following mechanisms as under:
Figure 8.18
The monoclonal origin of tumour cells in uterine
leiomyoma.

210
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
By mutation in the protooncogene which alters its
structure and function.
By retroviral insertion in the host cell.
By damage to the DNA sequence that normally regulates
growth-promoting signals of protooncogenes resulting in its
abnormal activation.
By erroneous formation of extra copies of protooncogene
causing gene amplification and hence its overexpression or
overproduction that promotes autonomous and excessive
cellular proliferation.
 In general, overactivity of oncogenes enhances cell
proliferation and promotes development of human cancer.
About 100 different oncogenes have been described in
various cancers. Transformation of proto-oncogene (i.e.
normal cell proliferation gene) to oncogenes (i.e. cancer cell
proliferation gene) may occur by three mechanisms:
i)
Point mutations i.e. an alteration of a single base in the
DNA chain. The most important example is RAS oncogene
carried in many human tumours such as bladder cancer,
pancreatic adenocarcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma.
ii) Chromosomal translocations i.e. transfer of a portion of one
chromosome carrying protooncogene to another
chromosome and making it independent of growth controls.
This is implicated in the pathogenesis of leukaemias and
lymphomas e.g.
Philadelphia chromosome seen in 95% cases of chronic
myelogenous leukaemia in which c-ABL protooncogene on
chromosome 9 is translocated to chromosome 22.
In 75% cases of Burkitt’s lymphoma, translocation of c-
MYC proto-oncogene from its site on chromosome 8 to a
portion on chromosome 14.
iii) Gene amplification i.e. increasing the number of copies of
DNA sequence in protooncogene leading to increased
mDNA and thus increased or overexpressed gene product.
Examples of gene amplification are found in some solid
human tumours e.g.
Neuroblastoma having n-MYC HSR region.
ERB-B1 in breast and ovarian cancer.
Most of the oncogenes encode for components of cell
signaling system for promoting cell proliferation. Possible
effects of oncogenes in signal transduction for cell
proliferation in human tumours are discussed below in
relation to the role of protooncogenes in mitosis in normal
cell cycle and are listed in Table 8.4 and schematically shown
in Fig. 8.20:
i)
Growth factors (GFs). GFs were the first protoonocgenes
to be discovered which encode for cell proliferation cascade.
They act by binding to cell surface receptors to activate cell
proliferation cascade within the cell. GFs are small
polypeptides elaborated by many cells and normally act on
another cell than the one which synthesised it to stimulate
its proliferation i.e. paracrine action.
However, a cancer cell may synthesise a GF and respond
to it as well; this way cancer cells acquire growth self-
sufficiency. Most often, growth factor genes are not altered
or mutated but instead growth factor genes are overexpressed
to stimulate large secretion of GFs which stimulate cell
proliferation. The examples of such tumour secreted GFs are
as under:
a) Platelet-derived growth factor- (PDGF-β): Overexpression of
SIS protooncogene that encodes for PDGF-β and thus there
Figure 8.19
Schematic representation of major properties of cancer in terms of molecular carcinogenesis.

211
CHAPTER 8
Neoplasia
is increased secretion of PDGF-β  e.g. in gliomas and
sarcomas.
b) Transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α): Overexpression of
TGF-α  gene occurs by stimulation of RAS protooncogene
and induces cell proliferation by binding to epidermal growth
factor (EGF) receptor e.g. in carcinoma and astrocytoma.
c) Fibroblast growth factor (FGF): Overexpression of HST-1
protoonogene and amplification of INT-2 protoonogene
causes excess secretion of FGF e.g. in cancer of the bowel
and breast.
d) Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF): Overexpression by binding
to its receptor c-MET e.g. follicular carcinoma thyroid.

Mechanisms of activation of protooncogenes to form growth promoting oncogenes.

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
ii) Receptors for GFs.  Growth factors cannot penetrate the
cell directly and require to be transported intracellularly by
GF-specific cell surface receptors. These receptors are
transmembrane proteins and thus have two surfaces: the
outer surface of the membrane has an area for binding growth
factor, and the inner surface of the membrane has enzyme-
activating area which eventually activates cell proliferation
pathway.
Most often, mutated form of growth factor receptors
stimulate cell proliferation even without binding to growth
factors i.e. with little or no growth factor bound to them.
Various forms of oncogenes encoding for GF receptors
include other mechanisms: overexpression, mutation and
gene rearrangement. Examples of tumours by mutated
receptors for growth factors are as under:
a)
EGF receptors: Normal EGF receptor gene is ERB B1, and
hence this receptor is termed as EGFR or HER1 (i.e. human
epidermal growth factor receptor type 1). EGFR (or HER1)
acts by overexpression of normal GF receptor e.g. in 80% of
squamous cell carcinoma of lung and 50% cases of
glioblastomas.
Another EGF receptor gene called ERB B2 (or HER2/neu)
acts by gene amplification e.g. in breast cancer (25%  cases),
carcinoma of lungs, ovary, stomach.
b) c-KIT receptor: The gene coding for receptor for stem cell
factor (or steel factor) is c-KIT, that activates tyrosine kinase
pathway in cell proliferation. Mutated form of c-KIT by point
mutation activates receptor for tyrosine kinase e.g. in
gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST).
c) RET receptor: RET (abbreviation of ‘rearranged during
transfection’) protooncogene is a receptor for tyrosine kinase
normally expressed in neuroendocrine cells of different
tissues. Mutated form by point mutation is seen in MEN type
2A and 2B and in medullary carcinoma thyroid.
iii) Cytoplasmic signal transduction proteins. The normal
signal transduction proteins in the cytoplasm transduce
signal from the GF receptors present on the cell surface, to
the nucleus of the cell, to activate intracellular growth
signaling pathways.
There are examples of oncogenes having mutated forms
of cytoplasmic signaling pathways located in the inner
surface of cell membrane in some cancers. These are as under:
a) Mutated RAS gene. This is the most common form of
oncogene in human tumours, the abnormality being induced
by point mutation in RAS gene. About a third of all human
tumours carry mutated RAS gene (RAS for Rat Sarcoma gene
where it was first described), seen particularly in carcinoma
colon, lung and pancreas. Normally, the inactive form of RAS
protein is GDP (guanosine diphosphate)-bound while the
activated form is bound to guanosine triphosphate (GTP).
GDP/GTP are homologous to G proteins and take part in
signal transduction in a similar way just as G proteins act as
‘on-off switch’ for signal transduction. Normally, active RAS
protein is inactivated by GTPase activity, while mutated RAS
gene remains unaffected by GTPase, and therefore, continues
to signal the cell proliferation.
b) BCR-ABL hybrid gene. ABL gene is a non-GF receptor
protooncogene having tyrosine kinase activity. ABL gene
from its normal location on chromosome 9 is translocated to
chromosome 22 where it fuses with BCR (breakpoint cluster
region) gene and forms an ABL-BCR hybrid gene which is
more potent in signal transduction pathway. ABL-BCR hybrid
gene is seen in chronic myeloid leukaemia and some acute
leukaemias.
iv) Nuclear transcription factors. The signal transduction
pathway that started with GFs ultimately reaches the nucleus
where it regulates DNA transcription and induces the cell to
enter into S phase. Out of various nuclear regulatory trans-
cription proteins described, the most important is MYC gene
located on long arm of chromosome 8. Normally MYC protein
binds to the DNA and regulates the cell cycle by
transcriptional activation and its levels fall immediately after
cell enters the cell cycle.
MYC oncogene (originally isolated from myelocyto-
matosis virus and accordingly abbreviated) is seen most
commonly in human tumours. It is associated with
persistence of or overexpression of MYC oncoproteins which,
in turn, causes autonomous cell proliferation. The examples
of tumours carrying MYC oncogene are as under:
a) C-MYC oncogene: Mutated MYC gene due to translocation
t(8;14) seen in Burkitt’s lymphoma.
b) N-MYC oncogene: Mutated MYC gene due to amplification
seen in neuroblastoma, small cell carcinoma lung.
c) L-MYC oncogene: Mutated MYC gene due to amplification
seen in small cell carcinoma lung.
v) Cell cycle regulatory proteins. As discussed in Chapter
3, normally the cell cycle is under regulatory control of cyclins
and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) A, B, E and D. Cyclins
are so named since they are cyclically synthesised during
different phases of the cell cycle and their degradation is also
cyclic. Cyclins activate as well as work together with CDKs,
while many inhibitors of CDKs (CDKIs) are also known.
Although all steps in the cell cycle are under regulatory
controls, G1 → S phase is the most important checkpoint for
regulation by oncogenes as well as anti-oncogenes (discussed
below). Mutations in cyclins (in particular cyclin D) and
CDKs (in particular CDK4) are most important growth
promoting signals in cancers. The examples of tumours
having such oncogenes are as under:
a) Mutated form of cyclin D protooncogene by translocation
seen in mantle cell lymphoma.
b) Mutated form of cyclin E by overexpression seen in breast
cancer.
b) Mutated from of CDK4 by gene amplification seen in
malignant melanoma, glioblastoma and sarcomas.
2.
REFRACTORINESS TO GROWTH INHIBITION:
GROWTH SUPPRESSING ANTI-ONCOGENES
The mutation of normal growth suppressor anti-oncogenes
results in removal of the brakes for growth; thus the
inhibitory effect to cell growth is removed and the abnormal
growth continues unchecked. In other words, mutated anti-
oncogenes behave like growth-promoting oncogenes.
As compared to the signals and signal transduction
pathways for oncogenes described above, the steps in
mechanisms of action by growth suppressors are not so well

213
CHAPTER 8
Neoplasia
understood. In general, the point of action by anti-oncogenes
is also G1 → S phase transition and probably act either by
inducing the dividing cell from the cell cycle to enter into G0
(resting) phase, or by acting in a way that the cell lies in the
post-mitotic pool losing its dividing capability. Just as with
activation of protooncogenes to become oncogenes, the
mechanisms of loss of tumour suppressor actions of genes
are due to chromosomal deletions, point mutations and loss
of portions of chromosomes.
Major anti-oncogenes implicated in human cancers are
as under (Table 8.5):
i) RB gene. RB gene is located on long arm (q) of chromosome
13. This is the first ever tumour suppressor gene identified
and thus has been amply studied. RB gene codes for a nuclear
transcription protein pRB. RB gene is termed as master
‘break’ in the cell cycle and is virtually present in every
human cell. It can exist in both an active and an inactive form:
The active form of RB gene, it blocks cell division by
binding to transcription factor, E2F, and thus inhibits the cell
from transcription of cell cycle-related genes, thereby
inhibiting the cell cycle at G1 → S phase i.e. cell cycle is
arrested at G1 phase.
Inactive form of RB gene occurs when it is
hyperphosphorylated by cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs)
which occurs when growth factors bind to their receptors.
This removes pRB function from the cell (i.e. the ‘break’ on
cell division is removed) and thus cell proliferation pathway
is stimulated by permitting the cell to cross G1 → S phase.
Activity of CDKs is inhibited by activation of inhibitory
signal, transforming growth factor- (TGF-β), on cell through
activation of inhibitory protein p16.
The mutant form of RB gene (i.e. inactivating mutation
of RB gene) is involved in several human tumours, most
commonly in retinoblastoma, the most common intraocular
tumour in young children. The tumour occurs in two forms:
sporadic and inherited/familial. More than half the cases are
sporadic affecting one eye; these cases have acquired
simultaneous mutation in both the alleles in retinal cells after
birth. In inherited cases, all somatic cells inherit one mutant
RB gene from a carrier parent, while the other allele gets
mutated later. The latter genetic explanation given by
Knudson forms the basis of two hit hypothesis of inherited
cancers. Besides retinoblastoma, children inheriting mutant
RB gene have 200 times greater risk of development of other
cancers in early adult life, most notably osteosarcoma; others
are cancers of breast, colon and lungs.
ii) p53 gene (TP53). Located on the short arm (p) of
chromosome 17, p53 gene (also termed TP53 because of
molecular weight of 53 kd for the protein) like pRB is
inhibitory to cell cycle. However, p53 is normally present in
very small amounts and accumulates only after DNA
damage.
The two major functions of p53 in the normal cell cycle
are as under:
a) In blocking mitotic activity: p53 inhibits the cyclins and CDKs
and prevents the cell to enter G1 phase transiently. This
breathing time in the cell cycle is utilised by the cell to repair
the DNA damage.
b) In promoting apoptosis: p53 acts together with another anti-
oncogene, RB gene, and identifies the genes that have
damaged DNA which cannot be repaired by inbuilt system.
p53 directs such cells to apoptosis by activating apoptosis-
inducing BAX gene, and thus bringing the defective cells to
an end by apoptosis. This process operates in the cell cycle
at G1 and G2 phases before the cell enters the S or M phase.
Because of these significant roles in cell cycle, p53 is called
as ‘protector of the genome’.
In its mutated form, p53 ceases to act as protector or as
growth suppressor but instead acts like a growth promoter
or oncogene. Homozygous loss of p53 gene allows genetically
damaged and unrepaired cells to survive and proliferate
resulting in malignant transformation. More than 70% of
human cancers have homozygous loss of p53 by acquired
mutations in somatic cells; some common examples are
cancers of the lung, head and neck, colon and breast. Besides,
mutated p53 is also seen in the sequential development stages
of cancer from hyperplasia to carcinoma in situ and into
invasive carcinoma.
Less commonly, both alleles of p53 gene become defective
by another way: one allele of p53 mutated by inheritance in
germ cell lines rendering the individual to another hit of
somatic mutation on the second allele. This defect like in RB
gene predisposes the individual to develop cancers of
multiple organs (breast, bone, brain, sarcomas etc), termed
Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

iii) Transforming growth factor-βββββ (TGF-βββββ) and its receptor.
Normally, TGF-β is significant inhibitor of cell proliferation,
especially in epithelial, endothelial and haematopoieitc cells
It acts by binding to TGF-β receptor and then the complex so
formed acts in G1 phase of cell cycle at two levels:
It activates CDK inhibitors (CDKIs) with growth
inhibitory effect.
It suppresses the growth prmoter genes such as MYC,
CDKs and cyclins.
Mutant form of TGF-β gene or its receptor impairs the
growth inhibiting effect and thus permits cell proliferation.
Examples of mutated form of TGF-β are seen in cancers of
pancreas, colon, stomach and endometrium.
iv) Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene and βββββ-catenin
protein. The APC gene is normally inhibitory to mitosis,
which takes place by a cytoplasmic protein, β-catenin. β-
catenin normally has dual functions: firstly, it binds to
cytoplasmic E-cadherin that is involved in intercellular
interactions, and secondly it can activate cell proliferation
signaling pathway. In colon cancer cells, APC gene is lost
and thus β-catenin fails to get degraded, allowing the cancer
cells to undergo mitosis without the inhibitory influence of
β-catenin.
Patients born with one mutant APC gene allele develop
large number of polyps in the colon early in life, while after
the age of 20 years these cases start developing loss of second
APC gene allele. It is then that almost all these patients
invariably develop malignant transformation of one or more
polyps.
v) Other antioncogenes. A few other tumour-suppressor
genes having mutated germline in various tumours are as
under:
a)
BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes: These are two breast (BR)
cancer (CA) susceptibility genes: BRCA1 located on
chromosoe 17q21 and BRCA2 on chromosome 13q12-13.
Women with inherited defect in BRCA1 gene have very high
risk (85%) of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer
(40%). Inherited breast cancer constitutes about 5-10% cases,
it tends to occur at a relatively younger age and more often
tends to be bilateral.
b) VHL gene. von-Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare
autosomal dominant disease characterised by benign and
malignant tumours of multiple tissues. The disease is
inherited as a mutation in VHL tumour suppressor gene
located on chromosome 3p. This results in activation of genes
that promote angiogenesis, survival and proliferation; VHL
gene is found inactivated in 60% cases of renal cell carcinoma.
c) Wilms’ tumour (WT) gene: Both WT1 an WT2 genes are
located on chromosome 11 and normally prevent neoplastic
proliferation of cells in embryonic kidney. Mutant form of
WT-1 and 2 are seen in hereditary Wilms’ tumour.
d) Neurofibroma (NF) gene: NF genes normally prevent
proliferation of Schwann cells. Two mutant forms are
described: NF1 and NF2 seen in neurofibromatosis type 1
and type 2.
The contrasting features of growth-promoting oncogenes
and growth-suppressing anti-oncogenes are summarised in
Table 8.6.
3. ESCAPING CELL DEATH BY APOPTOSIS:
GENES REGULATING APOPTOSIS AND CANCER
Besides the role of mutant forms of growth-promoting
oncogenes and growth-suppressing anti-oncogenes, another
mechanism of tumour growth is by escaping cell death by
apoptosis. Apoptosis in normal cell is guided by cell death
receptor, CD95, resulting in DNA damage. Besides, there is
role of some other pro-apoptotic factors (BAD, BAX, BID and
p53) and apoptosis-inhibitors (BCL2, BCL-X).
In cancer cells, the function of apoptosis is interfered due
to mutations in the above genes which regulate apoptosis in
the normal cell. The examples of tumours by this mechanism
are as under:
a) BCL2 gene is seen in normal lymphocytes, but its mutant
form with characteristic translocation (t14;18) (q32;q21) was
first described in B-cell lymphoma and hence the name BCL.
It is also seen in many other human cancers such as that of
breast, thyroid and prostate. Mutation in BCL2 gene removes
the apoptosis-inhibitory control on cancer cells, thus more
live cells undergoing mitosis contributing to tumour growth.
Besides, MYC oncogene and p53 tumour suppressor gene
are also connected to apoptosis. While MYC allows cell
growth BCL2 inhibits cell death; thus MYC and BCL2 together
allow cell proliferation. Normally, p53 activates proapoptotic
gene BAX but mutated p53 (i.e. absence of p53) reduces
apoptotic activity and thus allows cell proliferation.
b) CD95 receptors are depleted in hepatocellular carcinoma
and hence the tumour cells escape apoptosis.

AVOIDING CELLULAR AGING:
TELOMERES AND TELOMERASE IN CANCER
As discussed in pathology of aging in Chapter 3, after each
mitosis (cell doubling) there is progressive shortening of
telomeres which are the terminal tips of chromosomes.
Telomerase is the RNA enzyme that helps in repair of such
damage to DNA and maintains normal telomere  length in
successive cell divisions. However, it has been seen that after
repetitive mitosis for a maximum of 60 to 70 times, telomeres
are lost in normal cells and the cells cease to undergo mitosis.
Telomerase is active in normal stem cells but not in normal
somatic cells.
Cancer cells in most malignancies have markedly
upregulated telomerase enzyme, and hence telomere length
is maintained. Thus, cancer cells avoid aging, mitosis does
not slow down or cease, thereby immortalising the cancer
cells.
5.
CONTINUED PERFUSION OF CANCER:
TUMOUR ANGIOGENESIS
Cancers can only survive and thrive if the cancer cells are
adequately nourished and perfused, as otherwise they cannot
grow further. Neovascularisation in the cancers not only
supplies the tumour with oxygen and nutrients, but the
newly formed endothelial cells also elaborate a few growth
factors for progression of primary as well as metastatic
cancer. The stimulus for angiogenesis is provided by the
release of various factors:
i) Promoters of tumour angiogenesis include the most
important vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (released
from genes in the parenchymal tumour cells) and basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).
ii) Anti-angiogenesis factors inhibiting angiogenesis include
thrombospondin-1 (also produced by tumour cells themselves),
angiostatin, endostatin and vasculostatin. Mutated form of p53
gene in both alleles in various cancers results in removal of
anti-angiogenic role of thrombospondin-1, thus favouring
continued angiogenesis.
6.
INVASION AND DISTANT METASTASIS:
CANCER DISSEMINATION
One of the most important characteristic of cancers is
invasiveness and metastasis. The mechanisms involved in
the biology of invasion and metastasis are discussed already
along with spread of tumours.
7.
DNA DAMAGE AND REPAIR SYSTEM:
MUTATOR GENES AND CANCER
Normal cells during complex mitosis suffer from minor
damage to the DNA which is detected and repaired before
mitosis is completed so that integrity of the genome is
maintained. Similarly, small mutational damage to the
dividing cell by exogenous factors (e.g. by radiation, chemical
carcinogens etc) is also repaired. p53 gene is held responsible
for detection and repair of DNA damage. However, if this
system of DNA repair is defective as happens in some
inherited mutations (mutator genes), the defect in unrepaired
DNA is passed to the next progeny of cells and cancer results.
The examples of mutator genes exist in the following
inherited disorders associated with increased propensity to
cancer:
i)
Hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (Lynch syndrome) is
characterised by hereditary predisposition to develop
colorectal cancer. It is due to defect in genes involved in DNA
mismatch repair which results in accumulation of errors in
the form of mutations in many genes.
ii) Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) has ATM (M for mutated) gene.
These patients have multiple cancers besides other features
such as cerebellar degeneration, immunologic derangements
and oculo-cutaneous manifestations.
iii) Xeroderma pigmentosum is an inherited disorder in which
there is defect in DNA repair mechanism. Upon exposure to
sunlight, the UV radiation damage to DNA cannot be
repaired. Thus, such patients are more prone to various forms
of skin cancers.
iv) Bloom syndrome is an example of damage by ionising
radiation which cannot be repaired due to inherited defect
and the patients have increased risk to develop cancers,
particularly leukaemia.
v) Hereditary breast cancer patients having mutated BRCA1
and BRCA2 genes carry inherited defect in DNA repair
mechanism. These patients are not only predisposed to
develop breast cancer but also cancers of various other
organs.
8.
CANCER PROGRESSION AND HETEROGENEITY:
CLONAL AGGRESSIVENESS
Another feature of note in biology of cancers is that with
passage of time cancers become more aggressive; this
property is termed tumour progression. Clinical parameters
of cancer progression are: increasing size of the tumour,
higher histologic grade (as seen by poorer differentiation and
greater anaplasia), areas of tumour necrosis (i.e. tumour
outgrows its blood supply), invasiveness and distant
metastasis.
In terms of molecular biology, this attribute of cancer is
due to the fact that with passage of time cancer cells acquire
more and more heterogeneity. This means that though cancer
cells remain monoclonal in origin, they acquire more and
more mutations which, in turn, produce multiple-mutated
subpopulations of more aggressive clones of cancer cells (i.e.
heterogeneous cells) in the growth which have tendency to
invade, metastasise and be refractory to hormonal influences.
Some of these mutations in fact may kill the tumour cells as
well.
9.
CANCER A SEQUENTIAL MULTISTEP MOLE-
CULAR PHENOMENON:  MULTISTEP THEORY
It needs to be appreciated that cancer occurs following several
sequential steps of abnormalities in the target cell e.g.
initiation, promotion and progression in proper sequence.
Similarly, multiple steps are involved at genetic level by
which cell proliferation of cancer cells is activated: by
activation of growth promoters, loss of growth suppressors,
inactivation of intrinsic apoptotic mechanisms and escaping
cellular aging. A classic example of this sequential genetic
abnormalities in cancer is seen in adenoma-carcinoma

216
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
sequence in development of colorectal carcinoma. Recent
studies on human genome in cancers of breast and colon have
revealed that there is a multistep phenomenon of
carcinogenesis at molecular level; on an average a malignant
tumour has large number of genetic mutations in cancers.
10. MICRORNAs  IN CANCER: ONCOMIRS
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionally conserved,
endogenous, noncoding single stranded RNA molecules with
a length of 22 nucleotides only. Normally, miRNAs function
as the posttranslational gene regulators of cell proliferation,
differentiation and survival. More than 500 miRNAs have
been identified. Recent evidence indicates that miRNAs have
an oncogenic role in initiation and progression of cancer and
are termed as oncogenic microRNAs, abbreviated as
oncomiRs. In combination with other tumour associated
genes, oncomiRs can perform various functions: as tumour
suppressor, as tumour promoter, and as pro-apoptotic.
The above properties of cancer cells are schematically
illustrated in Fig. 8.21.
B. CHEMICAL CARCINOGENESIS
The first ever evidence of any cause for neoplasia came from
the observation of Sir Percival Pott in 1775 that there was
higher incidence of cancer of the scrotum in chimney-sweeps
in London than in the general population. This invoked wide
interest in soot and coal tar as possible carcinogenic agent
and the possibility of other occupational cancers. The first
successful experimental induction of cancer was produced
by two Japanese workers (Yamagiwa and Ichikawa) in 1914
in the rabbit’s skin by repeatedly painting with coal tar. Since
then the list of chemical carcinogens which can experi-
mentally induce cancer in animals and have epidemiological
evidence in causing human neoplasia, is ever increasing.
Stages in Chemical Carcinogenesis
The induction of cancer by chemical carcinogens occurs after
a delay—weeks to months in the case of experimental
animals, and often several years in man. Other factors that
influence the induction of cancer are the dose and mode of
administration of carcinogenic chemical, individual
susceptibility and various predisposing factors.
Basic mechanism of  chemical carcinogenesis  is by
induction of mutation in the proto-oncogenes and anti-
oncogenes. The phenomena of cellular transformation by
chemical carcinogens (as also other carcinogens) is a progres-
sive process involving 3 sequential stages: initiation,
promotion and progression (Fig. 8.22).
1.
INITIATION OF CARCINOGENESIS
Initiation is the first stage in carcinogenesis induced by
initiator chemical carcinogens. The change can be produced
by a single dose of the initiating agent for a short time, though
larger dose for longer duration is more effective. The change
so induced is sudden, irreversible and permanent. Chemical
carcinogens acting as initiators of carcinogenesis can be
grouped into 2 categories (Table 8.7):
Figure 8.21
Schematic representation of activation-inactivation of cancer-associated genes in cell cycle.

217
CHAPTER 8
Neoplasia
I.
Direct-acting carcinogens. These are a few chemical
substances (e.g. alkylating agents, acylating agents) which
can induce cellular transformation without undergoing any
prior metabolic activation.
II. Indirect-acting carcinogens or procarcinogens. These require
metabolic conversion within the body so as to become
‘ultimate’ carcinogens having carcinogenicity e.g. polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons, aromatic amines, azo dyes,
naturally-occurring products and others.
In either case, the following steps are involved in
transforming ‘the target cell’ into ‘the initiated cell’:
a) Metabolic activation. Vast majority of chemical carcino-
gens are indirect-acting or procarcinogens requiring
metabolic activation, while direct-acting carcinogens do not
require this activation. The indirect-acting carcinogens are
activated in the liver by the mono-oxygenases of the
cytochrome P-450 system in the endoplasmic reticulum. In
some circumstances, the procarcinogen may be detoxified
and rendered inactive metabolically.
In fact, following 2 requirements determine the
carcinogenic potency of a chemical:
i)
Balance between activation and inactivation reaction of
the carcinogenic chemical.
ii) Genes that code for cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes
involved in metabolic activation e.g a genotype carrying
susceptibility gene CYP1A1 for the enzyme system has far
higher incidence of lung cancer in light smokers as compared
to those not having this permissive gene.
Besides these two, additional factors such as age, sex and
nutritional status of the host also play some role in
determining response of the individual to chemical
carcinogen.
b) Reactive electrophiles. While direct-acting carcinogens
are intrinsically electrophilic, indirect-acting substances
become electron-deficient after metabolic activation i.e. they
become reactive electrophiles. Following this step, both types
of chemical carcinogens behave alike and their reactive
electrophiles bind to electron-rich portions of other molecules
of the cell such as DNA, RNA and other proteins.
c) Target molecules. The primary target of electrophiles is
DNA, producing mutagenesis. The change in DNA may lead
to ‘the initiated cell’ or some form of cellular enzymes may
be able to repair the damage in DNA. The classic example of
such a situation occurs in xeroderma pigmentosum, a
precancerous condition, in which there is hereditary defect
in DNA repair mechanism of the cell and thus such patients
are prone to develop skin cancer. The carcinogenic potential
of a chemical can be tested in vitro by Ames’ test for
mutagenesis (described later).
Any gene may be the target molecule in the DNA for the
chemical carcinogen. However, on the basis of chemically
induced cancers in experimental animals and epidemiologic
studies in human beings, it has been observed that most
frequently affected growth promoter oncogene is RAS gene
mutation and anti-oncogene (tumour suppressor) is p53 gene
mutation.

d) The initiated cell. The unrepaired damage produced in
the DNA of the cell becomes permanent and fixed only if the
altered cell undergoes at least one cycle of proliferation. This
results in transferring the change to the next progeny of cells
so that the DNA damage becomes permanent and irreversible,
which are the characteristics of the initiated cell, vulnerable
to the action of promoters of carcinogenesis.
The stimulus for proliferation may come from
regeneration of surviving cells, dietary factors, hormone-
induced hyperplasia, viruses etc. A few examples are the
occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma in cases of viral
hepatitis, association of endometrial hyperplasia with
endometrial carcinoma, effect of oestrogen in breast cancer.
2.
PROMOTION OF CARCINOGENESIS
Promotion is the next sequential stage in the chemical carcino-
genesis. Promoters of carcinogenesis are substances such as
phorbol esters, phenols, hormones, artificial sweeteners and
drugs like phenobarbital. They differ from initiators in the
following respects:
i)
They do not produce sudden change.
ii) They require application or administration, as the case
may be, following initiator exposure, for sufficient time and
in sufficient dose.
iii) The change induced may be reversible.
iv) They do not damage the DNA per se and are thus not
mutagenic but instead enhance the effect of direct-acting
carcinogens or procarcinogens.
v) Tumour promoters act by further clonal proliferation and
expansion of initiated (mutated) cells, and have reduced
requirement of growth factor, especially after RAS gene
mutation.
It may be mentioned here that persistent and sustained
application/exposure of the cell to initiator alone
unassociated with subsequent application of promoter may
also result in cancer. But the vice versa does not hold true
since neither application of promoter alone, nor its
application prior to exposure to initiator carcinogen, would
result in transformation of target cell.
3. PROGRESSION OF CARCINOGENESIS
Progression of cancer is the stage when mutated proliferated
cell shows phenotypic features of malignancy. These features
pertain to morphology, biochemical composition and
molecular features of malignancy. Such phenotypic features
appear only when the initiated cell starts to proliferate rapidly
and in the process acquires more and more mutations.  The
new progeny of cells that develops after such repetitive
proliferation inherits genetic and biochemical characteristics
of malignancy.
Carcinogenic Chemicals in Humans
The list of diverse chemical compounds which can produce
cancer in experimental animals is a long one but only some
of them have sufficient epidemiological evidence in human
neoplasia.
Depending upon the mode of action of carcinogenic
chemicals, they are divided into 2 broad groups: initiators
and promoters (Table 8.7).
1.
INITIATOR CARCINOGENS
Chemical carcinogens which can initiate the process of
neoplastic transformation are further categorised into 2
subgroups—direct-acting and indirect-acting carcinogens or
procarcinogens.
I.
DIRECT-ACTING CARCINOGENS. These chemical
carcinogens do not require metabolic activation and fall into
2 classes:
a) Alkylating agents. This group includes mainly various
anti-cancer drugs (e.g. cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil,
busulfan, melphalan, nitrosourea etc), β-propiolactone and
epoxides. They are weakly carcinogenic and are implicated
in the etiology of the lymphomas and leukaemias in human
beings.
b) Acylating agents. The examples are acetyl imidazole and
dimethyl carbamyl chloride.
II. INDIRECT-ACTING 
CARCINOGENS 
(PRO-
CARCINOGENS). These are chemical substances which
require prior metabolic activation before becoming potent
‘ultimate’ carcinogens. This group includes vast majority of
carcinogenic chemicals. It includes the following 4 categories:
a) Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. They comprise the
largest group of common procarcinogens which, after
metabolic activation, can induce neoplasia in many tissues
in experimental animals and are also implicated in a number
of human neoplasms. They cause different effects by various
modes of administration e.g. by topical application may
induce skin cancer, by subcutaneous injection may cause
sarcomas, inhalation produces lung cancer, when introduced
in different organs by parenteral/metabolising routes may
cause cancer of that organ.
Main sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are:
combustion and chewing of tobacco, smoke, fossil fuel (e.g.
coal), soot, tar, mineral oil, smoked animal foods, industrial
and atmospheric pollutants. Important chemical compounds
included in this group are: anthracenes (benza-, dibenza-,
dimethyl benza-), benzapyrene and methylcholanthrene. The
following examples have evidence to support the etiologic
role of these substances:
Smoking and lung cancer: There is 20 times higher incidence
of lung cancer in smokers of 2 packs (40 cigarettes) per day
for 20 years.
Skin cancer: Direct contact of polycyclic aromatic hydro-
carbon compounds with skin is associated with higher
incidence of skin cancer. For example, the natives of Kashmir
carry an earthen pot containing embers, the kangri, under
their clothes close to abdomen to keep themselves warm, and
skin cancer of the abdominal wall termed kangri cancer is
common among them.
Tobacco and betel nut chewing and cancer oral cavity: Cancer
of the oral cavity is more common in people chewing tobacco
and betel nuts. The chutta is a cigar that is smoked in South
India (in Andhra Pradesh) with the lighted end in the mouth
(i.e. reversed smoking) and such individuals have higher
incidence of cancer of the mouth.
b) Aromatic amines and azo-dyes. This category includes
the following substances implicated in chemical
carcinogenesis:

219
CHAPTER 8
Neoplasia
β-naphthylamine in the causation of bladder cancer, espe-
cially in aniline dye and rubber industry workers.
Benzidine in the induction of bladder cancer.
Azo-dyes used for colouring foods (e.g. butter and
margarine to give them yellow colour, scarlet red for
colouring cherries etc) in the causation of hepatocellular
carcinoma.
c) Naturally-occurring products. Some of the important
chemical carcinogens derived from plant and microbial sour-
ces are aflatoxin B1, actinomycin D, mitomycin C, safrole and
betel nuts. Out of these, aflatoxin B1 implicated in causing
human hepatocellular carcinoma is the most important,
especially when concomitant viral hepatitis B is present. It is
derived from the fungus, Aspergillus flavus,  that grows in
stored grains and plants.
d) Miscellaneous. A variety of other chemical carcinogens
having a role in the etiology of human cancer are as under:
Nitrosamines and nitrosamides are involved in gastric
carcinoma. These compounds are actually made in the
stomach by nitrosylation of food preservatives.
Vinyl chloride monomer derived from PVC (polyvinyl
chloride) polymer in the causation of haemangiosarcoma of
the liver.
Asbestos in bronchogenic carcinoma and mesothelioma,
especially in smokers.
Arsenical compounds in causing epidermal hyperplasia and
basal cell carcinoma.
Metals like nickel, lead, cobalt, chromium etc in industrial
workers causing lung cancer.
Insecticides and fungicides (e.g. aldrin, dieldrin, chlordane)
in carcinogenesis in experimental animals.
Saccharin and cyclomates in cancer in experimental animals.
2.
PROMOTER CARCINOGENS
Promoters are chemical substances which lack the intrinsic
carcinogenic potential but their application subsequent to
initiator exposure helps the initiated cell to proliferate further.
These substances include phorbol esters, phenols,  certain
hormones and drugs.

General Pathology and Basic Techniques
C. PHYSICAL CARCINOGENESIS
Physical agents in carcinogenesis are divided into 2 groups:
1.
Radiation, both ultraviolet light and ionising radiation, is
the most important physical agent. The role of radiation as
carcinogenic agent is discussed below while its non-
neoplastic complications are described in Chapter 3.
2.
Non-radiation physical agents are the various forms of
injury and are less important.
1. Radiation Carcinogenesis
Ultraviolet (UV) light and ionising radiation are the two
main forms of radiation carcinogens which can induce
cancer in experimental animals and are implicated in
causation of some forms of human cancers. A property
common between the two forms of radiation carcinogens is
the appearance of mutations followed by a long period of
latency after initial exposure, often 10-20 years or even later.
Also, radiation carcinogens may act to enhance the effect
of another carcinogen (co-carcinogens) and, like chemical
carcinogens, may have sequential stages of initiation,
promotion and progression in their evolution. Ultraviolet
light and ionising radiation differ in their mode of action
as described below:
i)
ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT. The main source of UV
radiation is the sunlight; others are UV lamps and welder’s
arcs. UV light penetrates the skin for a few millimetres only
so that its effect is limited to epidermis. The efficiency of UV
light as carcinogen depends upon the extent of light-
i)
Phorbol esters. The best known promoter in experimental
animals is TPA (tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate) which acts
by signal induction protein activation pathway.
ii) Hormones. Endogenous or exogenous oestrogen excess in
promotion of cancers of endometrium and breast, prolonged
administration of diethylstilbestrol in the etiology of
postmenopausal endometrial carcinoma and in vaginal
cancer in adolescent girls born to mothers exposed to this
hormone during their pregnancy.
iii) Miscellaneous  e.g. dietary fat in cancer of  colon, cigarette
smoke and viral infections etc.
The feature of initiators and promoters are contrasted in
Table 8.8.
Tests for Chemical Carcinogenicity
There are 2 main methods of testing chemical compound for
its carcinogenicity:
1.
EXPERIMENTAL INDUCTION. The traditional method
is to administer the chemical compound under test to a batch
of experimental animals like mice or other rodents by an
appropriate route e.g. painting on the skin, giving orally or
parenterally, or by inhalation. The chemical is administered
repeatedly, the dose varied, and promoting agents are
administered subsequently. After many months, the animal
is autopsied and results obtained. However, all positive or
negative tests cannot be applied to humans since there is
sufficient species variation in susceptibility to particular
carcinogen. Besides, the test is rather prolonged and
expensive.
2.
TESTS FOR MUTAGENICITY (AMES’ TEST). A muta-
gen is a substance that can permanently alter the genetic
composition of a cell. Ames’ test evaluates the ability of a
chemical to induce mutation in the mutant strain of Salmonella
typhimurium that cannot synthesise histidine. Such strains
are incubated with the potential carcinogen to which liver
homogenate is added to supply enzymes required to convert
procarcinogen to ultimate carcinogen. If the chemical under
test is mutagenic, it will induce mutation in the mutant strains
of S. typhimurium in the form of functional histidine gene,
which will be reflected by the number of bacterial colonies
growing on histidine-free culture medium (Fig. 8.23). Most
of the carcinogenic chemicals tested positive in Ames’ test
are carcinogenic in vivo.

CHAPTER 8
Neoplasia
absorbing protective melanin pigmentation of the skin. In
humans, excessive exposure to UV rays can cause various
forms of skin cancers—squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell
carcinoma and malignant melanoma. In support of this is
the epidemiological evidence of high incidence of these skin
cancers in fair-skinned Europeans, albinos who do not tan
readily, in inhabitants of Australia and New Zealand living
close to the equator who receive more sunlight, and in
farmers and outdoor workers due to the effect of actinic light
radiation.
Mechanism. UV radiation may have various effects on the
cells. The most important is induction of mutation; others
are inhibition of cell division, inactivation of enzymes and
sometimes causing cell death. The most important
biochemical effect of UV radiation is the formation of
pyrimidine dimers in DNA. Such UV-induced DNA damage
in normal individuals is repaired, while in the predisposed
persons who are excessively exposed to sunlight such
damage remain unrepaired. The proof in favour of mutagenic
effect of UV radiation comes from following recessive
hereditary diseases characterised by a defect in DNA repair
mechanism and associated with high incidence of cancers:
a) Xeroderma pigmentosum is predisposed to skin cancers
at younger age (under 20 years of age).
b) Ataxia telangiectasia is predisposed to leukaemia.
c) Bloom’s syndrome is predisposed to all types of cancers.
d) Fanconi’s anaemia with increased risk to develop cancer.
Besides, like with other carcinogens, UV radiation also
induces mutated forms of oncogenes (in particular RAS gene)
and anti-oncogenes (p53 gene).
ii) IONISING RADIATION. Ionising radiation of all kinds
like X-rays, α-, β- and γ-rays, radioactive isotopes, protons
and neutrons can cause cancer in animals and in man. Most
frequently, radiation-induced cancers are all forms of
leukaemias (except chronic lymphocytic leukaemia); others
are cancers of the thyroid (most commonly papillary
carcinoma), skin, breast, ovary, uterus, lung, myeloma, and
salivary glands (Fig. 8.24). The risk is increased by higher
dose and with high LET (linear energy transfer) such as in
neutrons and α-rays than with low LET as in X-rays and γ-
rays. The evidence in support of carcinogenic role of ionising
radiation is cited in the following examples:
a) Higher incidence of radiation dermatitis and subsequent
malignant tumours of the skin was noted in X-ray workers
and radiotherapists who did initial pioneering work in these
fields before the advent of safety measures.
b) High incidence of osteosarcoma was observed in young
American watch-working girls engaged in painting the dials
with luminous radium who unknowingly ingested radium
while using lips to point their brushes.
c) Miners in radioactive elements have higher incidence of
cancers.
d) Japanese atom bomb survivors of the twin cities of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki after World War II have increased
frequency of malignant tumours, notably acute and chronic
myeloid leukaemias, and various solid tumours of breast,
colon, thyroid and lung.
e) Accidental leakage at nuclear power plant in 1985 in
Chernobyl (in former USSR, now in Ukraine) has caused
long-term hazardous effects of radioactive material to the
population living in the vicinity.
f)
It has been observed that therapeutic X-ray irradiation
results in increased frequency of cancers, e.g. in patients of
ankylosing spondylitis, in children with enlarged thymus,
and in children irradiated in utero during investigations on
the mother.
Mechanism.  Radiation damages the DNA of the cell by one
of the 2 possible mechanisms:
a) It may directly alter the cellular DNA.
b) It may dislodge ions from water and other molecules of
the cell and result in formation of highly reactive free radicals
that may bring about the damage.
Damage to the DNA resulting in mutagenesis is the most
important action of ionising radiation. It may cause
chromosomal breakage, translocation, or point mutation. The
effect depends upon a number of factors such as type of
radiation, dose, dose-rate, frequency and various host factors
such as age, individual susceptibility, immune competence,
hormonal influences and type of cells irradiated.
2. Non-radiation Physical Carcinogenesis
Mechanical injury to the tissues such as from stones in the
gallbladder, stones in the urinary tract, and healed scars
following burns or trauma, has been suggested as the cause
of increased risk of carcinoma in these tissues but the
evidence is not convincing. Asbestosis and asbestos-
associated tumours of the lung are discussed in Chapter 17,
Figure 8.24
Neoplastic (left) and non-neoplastic complications (right)
of ionising radiation.

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
the characteristic tumour being malignant mesothelioma of
the pleura. Other examples of physical agents in
carcinogenesis are the implants of inert materials such as
plastic, glass etc in prostheses or otherwise, and foreign
bodies observed to cause tumour development in
experimental animals. However, tumorigenesis by these
materials in humans is rare.
D. BIOLOGIC CARCINOGENESIS
The epidemiological studies on different types of cancers
indicate the involvement of transmissible biologic agents in
their development, chiefly viruses. Other biologic agents
implicated in carcinogenesis are as follows:
Parasites. Schistosoma haematobium infection of the urinary
bladder is associated with high incidence of squamous cell
carcinoma of the urinary bladder in some parts of the world
such as in Egypt. Clonorchis sinensis, the liver fluke, lives in
the hepatic duct and is implicated in causation of
cholangiocarcinoma.
Fungus. Aspergillus flavus grows in stored grains and
liberates aflatoxin; its human consumption, especially by
those with HBV infection, is associated with development of
hepatocellular carcinoma.
Bacteria. Helicobacter pylori, a gram-positive spiral-shaped
micro-organism, colonises the gastric mucosa and has been
found in cases of chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer; its
prolonged infection may lead to gastric lymphoma and
gastric carcinoma, this subject is discussed in detail in
Chapter 20.
However, the role of viruses in the causation of cancer is
more significant. Therefore, biologic carcinogenesis is largely
viral carcinogenesis, described below.
VIRAL CARCINOGENESIS
It has been estimated that about 20% of all cancers worldwide
are due to persistent virus infection. The association of
oncogenic viruses with neoplasia was first observed by an
Italian physician Sanarelli in 1889 who noted association
between myxomatosis of rabbits with poxvirus. The
contagious nature of the common human wart was first
established in 1907. Since then, a number of viruses capable
of inducing tumours (oncogenic viruses) in experimental
animals, and some implicated in humans, have been
identified.
Oncogenic Viral Infections: General Aspects
Most of the common viral infections (including oncogenic
viruses) can be transmitted by one of the 3 routes:
i)
Horizontal transmission. Commonly, viral infection passes
from one to another by direct contact, by ingestion of
contaminated water or food, or by inhalation as occurs in
most contagious diseases. Most of these infections begin on
the epithelial surfaces, spread into deeper tissues, and then
through haematogenous or lymphatic or neural route
disseminate to other sites in the body.
ii) By parenteral route such by inoculation as happens in some
viruses by inter-human spread and from animals and insects
to humans.
iii) Vertical transmission, when the infection is genetically
transmitted from infected parents to offsprings.
Based on their nucleic acid content, oncogenic viruses fall
into 2 broad groups:
1.
Those containing deoxyribonucleic acid are called DNA
oncogenic viruses.
2.
Those containing ribonucleic acid are termed RNA
oncogenic viruse or retroviruses.
Both types of oncogenic viruses usually have 3 genes and
are abbreviated according to the coding pattern by each gene:
i) gag gene: codes for group antigen.
ii) pol gene: codes for polymerase enzyme.
iii) env gene: codes fro envelope protein.
Primary viral infections are majority of the common viral
infections in which the infection lasts for a few days to a few
weeks and produce clinical manifestations. Primary viral
infections are generally cleared by body’s innate immunity
and specific immune responses. Subsequently, an
immunocompetent host is generally immune to the disease
or reinfection by the same virus.  However, body’s immune
system is not effective against surface colonization or deep
infection or persistence of viral infection.
Persistence of viral infection or latent infection in some
viruses may occur by acquiring mutations in viruses which
resist immune attack by the host, or virus per se induces
immunosuppression in the host such as HIV.
Viral Oncogenesis: General Aspects
In general, persistence of DNA or RNA viruses may induce
mutation in the target host cell, although persistence of viral
infection alone is not sufficient for oncogenesis but is one
step in the multistep process of cancer development.
Generally, RNA viruses have very high mutation rate (e.g.
HIV, HCV) than DNA viruses. Mechanisms as to how specific
DNA and RNA viruses cause mutation in the host cell are
varied, but in general persistence of DNA or RNA viral
infection causes activation of growth-promoting pathways
or inhibition of tumour-suppressor products in the infected
cells. Thus, such virus-infected host cells after having
undergone genetic changes enter cell cycle and produce next
progeny of transformed cells which have characteristics of
autonomous growth and survival completing their role as
oncogenic viruses.
General mode of oncogenesis by each group of DNA and
RNA oncogenic viruses is briefly considered below:
1.
Mode of DNA viral oncogenesis. Host cells infected by
DNA oncogenic viruses may have one of the following 2
results (Fig. 8.25):
i)
Replication. The virus may replicate in the host cell with
consequent lysis of the infected cell and release of virions.
ii) Integration. The viral DNA may integrate into the host
cell DNA.
The latter event (integration) results in inducing mutation
and thus neoplastic transformation of the host cell, while the
former (replication) brings about cell death but no neoplastic
transformation. A feature essential for host cell trans-
formation is the expression of virus-specific T-(transforming
protein) antigens immediately after infection of the host cell
by DNA oncogenic virus (discussed later).

223
CHAPTER 8
Neoplasia
2.
Mode of RNA viral oncogenesis. RNA viruses or
retroviruses contain two identical strands of RNA and the
enzyme, reverse transcriptase (Fig. 8.26):
i)
Reverse transcriptase is RNA-dependent DNA synthetase
that acts as a template to synthesise a single strand of matching
viral DNA i.e. reverse of the normal in which DNA is
transcribed into messenger RNA.
ii) The single strand of viral DNA is then copied by DNA-
dependent DNA synthetase to form another strand of
complementary DNA resulting in double-stranded viral DNA
or provirus.
iii) The provirus is then integrated into the DNA of the host
cell genome and may induce mutation and thus transform
the cell into neoplastic cell.
iv) Retroviruses are replication-competent. The host cells which
allow replication of integrated retrovirus are called
permissive cells. Non-permissible cells do not permit
replication of the integrated retrovirus.
v) Viral replication begins after integration of the provirus
into host cell genome. Integration results in transcription of
proviral genes or progenes into messenger RNA which then
forms components of the virus particle—virion core protein from
gag gene, reverse transcriptase from pol gene, and envelope
glycoprotein from env gene. The three components of virus
particle are then assembled at the plasma membrane of the
host cell and the virus particles released by budding off from
the plasma membrane, thus completing the process of
replication.
Support to the etiologic role of oncogenic viruses in
causation of human cancers is based on the following:
1.
Epidemiologic data.
2.
Presence of viral DNA in the genome of host target cell.
3.
Demonstration of virally induced transformation of
human target cells in culture.
4.
In vivo demonstration of expressed specific transforming
viral genes in premalignant and malignant cells.
Figure 8.25
Replication and integration of DNA virus in the host
cell.
A, Replication: Step 1. The DNA virus invades the host cell. Step 2. Viral
DNA is incorporated into the host nucleus and T-antigen is expressed
immediately after infection. Step 3. Replication of viral DNA occurs and
other components of virion are formed. The new virions are assembled
in the cell nucleus. Step 4. The new virions are released, accompanied
by host cell lysis. B, Integration : Steps 1 and 2 are similar as in replication.
Step 3. Integration of viral genome into the host cell genome occurs
which requires essential presence of functional T-antigen. Step 4. A
‘transformed (neoplastic) cell’ is formed.
Figure 8.26
Integration and replication of RNA virus (retrovirus) in
the host cell.
Step 1. The RNA virus invades the host cell. The viral envelope fuses
with the plasma membrane of the host cell; viral RNA genome as well as
reverse transcriptase are released into the cytosol. Step 2. Reverse
transcriptase acts as template to synthesise single strand of matching
viral DNA which is then copied to form complementary DNA resulting in
double-stranded viral DNA (provirus). Step 3. The provirus is integrated
into the host cell genome producing ‘transformed host cell.’ Step 4.
Integration of the provirus brings about replication of viral components
which are then assembled and released by budding.

In vitro assay of specific viral gene products which
produce effects on cell proliferation and survival.
With these general comments, now we turn to specific
DNA and RNA oncogenic viruses and oncogenesis by them.
Specific DNA Oncogenic Viruses
DNA oncogenic viruses have direct access to the host cell
nucleus and are incorporated into the genome of the host
cell. DNA viruses are classified into 5 subgroups, each of
which is capable of producing neoplasms in different hosts
(Table 8.9). These are: Papovaviruses, Herpesviruses,
Adenoviruses, Poxviruses and Hepadna viruses.
1.
PAPOVAVIRUSES. This group consists of the papilloma
virus including the human papilloma virus (HPV), polyoma
virus and SV-40 (simian vacuolating) virus. These viruses
have an etiologic role in following benign and malignant
neoplasms in animals and in humans:
i)
Papilloma viruses. These viruses were the first to be
implicated in the etiology of any human neoplasia. These
viruses appear to replicate in the layers of stratified squamous
epithelium. More than 100 HPV types have been identified;
the individual types are associated with different lesions. The
following examples of benign and malignant tumours are
cited to demonstrate their role in oncogenesis:
In humans—
HPV was first detected as etiologic agent in common skin
warts or verruca vulgaris (squamous cell papillomas) by
Shope in 1933; the condition is infectious. Current evidence
supports implication of low-risk HPV types 1,2, 4 and 7 in
common viral warts.
Low-risk HPV types 6 and 11 are involved in the etiology
of genital warts (condyloma acuminata).
Viral DNA of high-risk HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33 and 45
has been seen in 75-100% cases of invasive cervical cancer and
its precursor lesions (carcinoma in situ and dysplasia) and is
strongly implicated.
High-risk HPVs are also involved in causation of other
squamous cell carcinomas and dysplasias such as of anus,
perianal region, vagina, vulva, penis and oral cavity.
HPV types 5 and 8  are responsible for causing an
uncommon condition, epidermodysplasia verruciformis. The
condition is characterised by multiple skin warts and a
genetic defect in the cell-mediated immunity. About one-
third of cases develop squamous cell carcinoma in the sun-
exposed warts.
Some strains of HPV are responsible for causing multiple
juvenile papillomas of the larynx.
In animals—
Benign warty lesions similar to those seen in humans are
produced by different members of the papilloma virus family
in susceptible animals such as in rabbits by cottontail rabbit
papilloma virus, and in cattle by bovine papilloma virus
(BPV).
There is evidence to suggest the association of BPV and
cancer of the alimentary tract in cattle.

Neoplasia
discussed earlier and directly affect cell growth by following
mechanisms:
i) HPV integrates in to the host cell DNA which results in
overexpression of viral proteins E6 and E7 from high risk
HPV types. E6 and E7 from high-risk HPVs has high affinity
for target host cells than these viral oncoproteins from low-
risk HPVs.
ii) E6 and E7 viral proteins cause loss of p53 and pRB, the
two cell proteins with tumour-suppressor properties. Thus
the breaks in cell proliferation are removed, permitting the
uncontrolled proliferation.
iii) These viral proteins activate cyclin A and E, and inactivate
CDKIs, thus permitting further cell proliferation.
iv) These viral proteins mediate and degrade BAX, a
proapoptotic gene, thus inhibiting apoptosis.
v)  These viral proteins activate telomerase, immortalising
the transformed host target cells.
ii) Polyoma virus. Polyoma virus occurs as a natural
infection in mice.
In animals—Polyoma virus infection is responsible for
various kinds of carcinomas and sarcomas in
immunodeficient (nude) mice and other rodents. In view of
its involvement in causation of several unrelated tumours in
animals, it was named polyoma.
In humans—Polyoma virus infection is not known to
produce any human tumour. But it is involved in causation
of polyomavirus nephropathy in renal allograft recipients
and is also implicated in the etiology of progressive
demyelinating leucoencephalopathy, a fatal demyelinating
disease.
iii) SV-40 virus. As the name suggests, simian vacuolating
virus exists in monkeys without causing any harm but can
induce sarcoma in hamsters. There is some evidence of
involvement of SV-40 infection in mesothelioma of the pleura.
2.
HERPESVIRUSES. Primary infection of all the
herpesviruses in man persists probably for life in a latent
stage which can get reactivated later. Important members of
herpesvirus family are Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex
virus type 2 (HSV-2) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8),
cytomegalovirus (CMV), Lucke’s frog virus and Marek’s
disease virus. Out of these, Lucke’s frog virus and Marek’s
disease virus are implicated in animal tumours only (renal
cell carcinoma and T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma respectively).
There is no oncogenic role of HSV-2 and CMV in human
tumours. The other two—EBV and HHV are implicated in
human tumours as under.
EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS (EBV). EBV infects human B-
lymphocytes and epithelial cells and long-term infection
stimulates them to proliferate and development of
malignancies. EBV is implicated in the following human
tumours—Burkitt’s lymphoma, anaplastic nasopharyngeal
carcinoma, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease,
primary CNS lymphoma in AIDS patients, and Hodgkin’s
lymphoma. It is also shown to be causative for infectious
mononucleosis, a self-limiting disease in humans. The role
of EBV in the first two human tumours is given below while
others have been discussed elsewhere in relevant chapters.
Burkitt’s lymphoma. Burkitt’s lymphoma was initially
noticed in African children by Burkitt in 1958 but is now
known to occur in 2 forms—African endemic form, and sporadic
form seen elsewhere in the world. The morphological aspects
of the tumour are explained in Chapter 14, while oncogenesis
is described here.
There is strong evidence linking Burkitt’s lymphoma, a
B-lymphocyte neoplasm, with EBV as observed from the
following features:
a) Over 90% of Burkitt’s lymphomas are EBV-positive in
which the tumour cells carry the viral DNA.
b) 100% cases of Burkitt’s lymphoma show elevated levels
of antibody titers to various EBV antigens.
c) EBV has strong tropism for B lymphocytes. EBV-infected
B cells grown in cultures are immortalised i.e. they continue
to develop further along B cell-line to propagate their progeny
in the altered form.
d) Though EBV infection is almost worldwide in all adults
and is also known to cause self-limiting infectious
mononucleosis, but the fraction of EBV-infected circulating
B cells in such individuals is extremely small.
e) Linkage between Burkitt’s lymphoma and EBV infection
is very high in African endemic form of the disease and
probably in cases of AIDS than in sporadic form of the
disease.
However, a few observations, especially regarding spora-
dic cases of Burkitt’s lymphoma, suggest that certain other
supportive factors may be contributing. Immunosuppression
appears to be one such most significant factor. The evidence
in favour is as follows:
Normal individuals harbouring EBV-infection as well as
cases developing infectious mononucleosis are able to mount
good immune response so that they do not develop Burkitt’s
lymphoma.
In immunosuppressed patients such as in HIV infection
and organ transplant recipients, there is marked reduction
in body’s T-cell immune response and higher incidence of
this neoplasm.
It is observed that malaria, which confers immuno-
suppressive effect on the host, is prevalent in endemic
proportions in regions where endemic form of Burkitt’s
lymphoma is frequent. This supports the linkage of EBV
infection and immunosuppression in the etiology of Burkitt’s
lymphoma.
Anaplastic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This is the other
tumour having close association with EBV infection. The
tumour is prevalent in South-East Asia, especially in the
Chinese, and in Eskimos. The morphology of nasopharyngeal
carcinoma is described in Chapter 18. The evidence linking
EBV infection with this tumour is as follows:
a) 100% cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma carry DNA of
EBV in nuclei of tumour cells.
b) Individuals with this tumour have high titers of
antibodies to various EBV antigens.

226
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
However, like in case of Burkitt’s lymphoma, there may
be some co-factors such as genetic susceptibility that account
for the unusual geographic distribution.
EBV ONCOGENESIS IN HUMAN CANCER—
Persistent EBV infection is implicated in the causation of
malignancies of B lymphocytes and epithelial cells. The
mechanism of oncogenesis is as under:
i) Latently infected epithelial cells or B lymphocytes express
viral oncogene LMP1 (latent membrane protein) which is
most crucial step in evolution of EBV-associated malig-
nancies. Immunosuppressed individuals are unable to mount
attack against EBV infection and thus are more affected.
ii) LMP1 viral protein dysregulates normal cell proliferation
and survival of infected cells and acts like CD40 receptor
molecule on B cell surface. Thus, it stimulates B-cell
proliferation by activating growth signaling pathways via
nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and JAK/STAT pathway.
iii) LMP1 viral oncoprotein also activates BCL2 and thereby
prevents apoptosis.
iv) Persistent EBV infection elaborates another viral protein
EBNA-2 which activates cyclin D in the host cells and thus
promotes cell proliferation.
v) In immunocompetent individuals, LMP1 is kept under
contro by the body’s immune system and in these persons
therefore lymphoma cells appear only after another
characteristic mutation t(8;14) activates growth promoting
MYC oncogene.
HUMAN HERPESVIRUS 8 (HHV-8). It has been shown that
infection with HHV-8 or Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus (KSHV) is associated with Kaposi’s sarcoma, a
vascular neoplasm common in patients of AIDS. Compared
to sporadic Kaposi’s sarcoma, the AIDS-associated tumour
is multicentric and more aggressive. HHV-8 has lympho-
tropism and is also implicated in causation of pleural effusion
lymphoma and multicentric variant of Castleman’s disease.
HHV-8 (KSHV) ONCOGENESIS IN HUMAN CANCER—
i) Viral DNA is seen in nuclei of all tumour cells in Kaposi’s
sarcoma.
ii) There is overexpression of several KSHV oncoproteins by
latently infected cells: v-cyclin, v-interferon regulatory factor
(v-IRF) and LANA (latency-associated nuclear antigen).
iii) These viral proteins cause increased proliferation and
survival of host cells and thus induce malignancy.
3.
ADENOVIRUSES. The human adenoviruses cause
upper respiratory infections and pharyngitis.
In humans, they are not known to be involved in any
tumour.
In hamsters, they may induce sarcomas.
4.
POXVIRUSES. This group of oncogenic viruses is
involved in the etiology of following lesions:
In rabbits—poxviruses cause myxomatosis.
In humans—poxviruses cause molluscum contagiosum
and may induce squamous cell papilloma.
5.
HEPADNAVIRUSES. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a
member of hepadnavirus (hepa- from hepatitis, -dna from
DNA) family. HBV infection in man causes an acute hepatitis
and is responsible for a carrier state, which can result in some
cases to chronic hepatitis progressing to hepatic cirrhosis,
and onto hepatocellular carcinoma. These lesions and the
structure of HBV are described in detail in Chapter 21. Suffice
this to say here that there is strong epidemiological evidence
linking HBV infection to development of hepatocellular
carcinoma as evidenced by the following:
a) The geographic differences in the incidence of
hepatocellular carcinoma closely match the variation in
prevalence of HBV infection e.g. high incidence in Far-East
and Africa.
b) Epidemiological studies in high incidence regions
indicate about 200 times higher risk of developing hepato-
cellular carcinoma in HBV-infected cases as compared to
uninfected population in the same area.
Posssible mechanism of hepatocellular carcinoma
occurring in those harbouring long-standing infection with
HBV is chronic destruction of HBV-infected hepatocytes
followed by continued hepatocyte proliferation. This process
renders the hepatocytes vulnerable to the action of other risk
factors such as to aflatoxin causing mutation and neoplastic
proliferation.
More recent evidence has linked an oncogenic role to
another hepatotropic virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV) as well
which is an RNA virus, while HBV is a DNA virus. HCV is
implicated in about half the cases of hepatocellular carcinoma
in much the same way as HBV.
HEPATITIS VIRUS ONCOGENESIS IN HUMAN CANCER—
Epidemiologic data firmly support that two hepatotropic
viruses, HBV—a DNA virus, and HCV—an RNA virus, are
currently involved in causation of 70-80% cases of
hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Although HBV DNA
has been found integrated in the genome of human
hepatocytes in many cases of liver cancer which causes
mutational changes but a definite pattern is lacking. Thus,
exact molecular mechanism as to how HBV and HCV cause
hepatocellular carcinoma is yet not quite clear. Probably,
multiple factors are involved:
i) Chronic and persistent viral infection with HBV or HCV
incites repetitive cycles of inflammation, immune response,
cell degeneration/cell death, and regeneration of the
hepatocytes which leads to DNA damage to liver cells of the
host.
ii) It is possible that immune response by the host to
persistent unresolved infection with these hepatitis viruses
becomes defective which promotes tumour development.
iii) On regeneration, proliferation of hepatocytes is stimulated
by several growth factors and cytokines elaborated by
activated immune cells which contribute to tumour
development e.g. factors for angiogenesis, cell survival etc.
iv) Activated immune cells produce nuclear factor κB
(NF-κB) that inhibits apoptosis, thus allowing cell survival
and growth.
v) HBV genome contains a gene HBx which activates growth
signaling pathway.
vi) HBV and HCV do not encode for any specific viral
oncoproteins.

227
CHAPTER 8
Neoplasia
Specific RNA Oncogenic Viruses
RNA oncogenic viruses are retroviruses i.e. they contain the
enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT), though all retroviruses
are not oncogenic (Table 8.10). The enzyme, reverse trans-
criptase, is required for reverse transcription of viral RNA
to synthesise viral DNA strands i.e. reverse of normal—rather
than DNA encoding for RNA synthesis, viral RNA transcripts
for the DNA by the enzyme RT present in the RNA viruses.
RT is a DNA polymerase and helps to form complementary
DNA (cDNA) that moves in to host cell nucleus and gets
incorporated in to it.
 Based on their activity to transform target cells into
neoplastic cells, RNA viruses are divided into 3 subgroups—
acute transforming viruses, slow transforming viruses, and
human T-cell lymphotropic viruses (HTLV). The former two
are implicated in inducing a variety of tumours in animals
only while HTLV is causative for human T-cell leukaemia
and lymphoma.
1.
ACUTE TRANSFORMING VIRUSES. This group
includes retroviruses which transform all the cells infected
by them into malignant cells rapidly (‘acute’). All the viruses
in this group possess one or more viral oncogenes (v-oncs).
All the members of acute transforming viruses discovered
so far are defective viruses in which the particular v-onc has
substituted other essential genetic material such as gag, pol
and env. These defective viruses cannot replicate by
themselves unless the host cell is infected by another ‘helper
virus’. Acute oncogenic viruses have been identified in
tumours in different animals only e.g.
a) Rous sarcoma virus in chickens.
b) Leukaemia-sarcoma viruses of various types such as
avian, feline, bovine and primate.
2.
SLOW TRANSFORMING VIRUSES. These oncogenic
retroviruses cause development of leukaemias and
lymphomas in different species of animals (e.g. in mice, cats
and bovine) and include the mouse mammary tumour virus
(MMTV) that causes breast cancer in the daughter-mice
suckled by the MMTV-infected mother via the causal agent
in the mother’s milk (Bittner milk factor). These viruses have
long incubation period between infection and development
of neoplastic transformation (‘slow’). Slow transforming
viruses cause neoplastic transformation by insertional
mutagenesis i.e. viral DNA synthesised by viral RNA via
reverse transcriptase is inserted or integrated near the
protooncogenes of the host cell resulting in damage to host
cell genome (mutagenesis) leading to neoplastic trans-
formation.
3.
HUMAN T-CELL LYMPHOTROPIC VIRUSES
(HTLV). HTLV is a form of slow transforming virus but is
described separately because of 2 reasons:
i)
This is the only retrovirus implicated in human cancer.
ii) The mechanism of neoplastic transformation is different
from slow transforming as well as from acute transforming
viruses.
Four types of HTLVs are recognised—HTLV-I, HTLV-II,
HTLV-III and HTLV-IV. It may be mentioned in passing here
that the etiologic agent for AIDS, HIV, is also an HTLV
(HTLV-III) as described in Chapter 4.
A link between HTLV-I infection and cutaneous adult T-
cell leukaemia-lymphoma (ATLL) has been identified while
HTLV-II is implicated in causation of T-cell variant of hairy
cell leukaemia. HTLV-I is transmitted through sexual contact,
by blood, or to infants during breastfeeding. The highlights
of this association and mode of neoplastic transformation
are as under:
i)
Epidemiological studies by tests for antibodies have
shown that HTLV-I infection is endemic in parts of Japan
and West Indies where the incidence of ATLL is high. The
latent period after HTLV-I infection is, however, very long
(20-30 years).
ii) The initiation of neoplastic process is similar to that for
Burkitt’s lymphoma except that HTLV-I has tropism for
CD4+T lymphocytes as in HIV infection, while EBV of
Burkitt’s lymphoma has tropism for B lymphocytes.
iii)  As in Burkitt’s lymphoma, immunosuppression plays a
supportive role in the neoplastic transformation by HTLV-I
infection.
HTLV ONCOGENESIS IN HUMAN CANCER—
The molecular mechanism of ATLL leukaemogenesis by
HTLV infection of CD4+ T lymphocytes is not clear.
Neoplastic transformation by HTLV-I infection differs from

acute transforming viruses because it does not contain v-onc,
and from other slow transforming viruses because it does
not have fixed site of insertion for insertional mutagenesis.
Probably, the process is multifactorial:
i) HTLV-I genome has unique region called pX distinct from
other retroviruses, which encodes for two essential viral
oncoproteins— TAX and REX. TAX protein up-regulates the
expression of cellular genes controlling T-cell replication,
while REX gene product regulates viral protein production
by affecting mRNA expression.
ii) TAX viral protein interacts with transcription factor, NF-
κB, which stimulates genes for cytokines (interleukins) and
their receptors in infected T cells which activates proliferation
of T cells by autocrine pathway.
iii) The inappropriate gene expression activates pathway of
the cell proliferation by activation of cyclins and inactivation
of tumour suppressor genes CDKN2A/p16 and p53,
stimulating cell cycle.
iv) Initially, proliferation of infected T cells is polyclonal but
subsequently several mutations appear due to TAX-based
genomic changes in the host cell and monoclonal proliferation
of leukaemia occurs.
VIRUSES AND HUMAN CANCER: A SUMMARY
In man, epidemiological as well as circumstantial evidence
has been accumulating since the discovery of contagious
nature of common human wart (papilloma) in 1907 that
cancer may have viral etiology. Presently, about 20% of all
human cancers worldwide are virally induced. Aside from
experimental evidence, the etiologic role of DNA and RNA
viruses in a variety of human neoplasms has already been
explained above. Here, a summary of different viruses
implicated in human tumours is presented (Fig. 8.27):
Benign tumours. There are 2 conditions which are actually
doubtful as tumours in which definite viral etiology is esta-
blished. These are:
i)
Human wart (papilloma) caused by human papilloma
virus; and
ii) Molluscum contagiosum caused by poxvirus.
Malignant tumours. The following 8 human cancers have
enough epidemiological, serological, and in some cases
genomic evidence, that viruses are implicated in their
etiology:
i)
Burkitt’s lymphoma by Epstein-Barr virus.
ii) Nasopharyngeal carcinoma by Epstein-Barr virus.
iii) Primary hepatocellular carcinoma by hepatitis B virus and
hepatitis C virus.
iv) Cervical cancer by high risk human papilloma virus types
(HPV 16 and 18).
v) Kaposi’s sarcoma by human herpes virus type 8 (HHV-8).
vi) Pleural effusion B cell lymphoma by HHV8.
vii) Adult T-cell leukaemia and lymphoma by HTLV-I.
viii) T-cell variant of hairy cell leukaemia by HTLV-II.
Current knowledge and understanding of viral
carcinogenesis has provided an opportunity to invent specific
vaccines and suggest appropriate specific therapy. For
example, hepatitis B vaccines is being widely used to control
hepatitis B and is expected to lower incidence of HBV-related
hepatocellular carcinoma. HPV vaccine has been launched
lately and is likely to lower the incidence of HPV-associated
cervical cancer.
CLINICAL ASPECTS OF NEOPLASIA
Two major aspects of clinical significance in assessing the
course and management of neoplasia are: tumour-host inter-
relationship (i.e. the effect of tumour on host and vice versa)
and laboratory diagnosis of cancer.
TUMOUR-HOST INTER-RELATIONSHIP
The natural history of a neoplasm depends upon 2 features:
i)
 Host response against tumour (Immunology of cancer)
ii) Effect of tumour on host
HOST RESPONSE AGAINST TUMOUR
(TUMOUR IMMUNOLOGY)
It has long been known that body’s immune system can
recognise tumour cells as ‘non-self’ and attempt to destroy
them and limit the spread of cancer. The following
observations provide basis for this concept:
1.
Certain cancers evoke significant lymphocytic infiltrates
composed of immunocompetent cells and such tumours have
somewhat better prognosis e.g. medullary carcinoma breast
(as compared with infiltrating ductal carcinoma), seminoma
testis (as compared with other germ cell tumours of testis).
2.
Rarely, a cancer may spontaneously regress partially or
completely, probably under the influence of host defense
mechanism. For example, rare spontaneous disappearance

229
CHAPTER 8
Neoplasia
of malignant melanoma temporarily from the primary site
which may then reappear as metastasis.
3.
It is highly unusual to have primary and secondary
tumours in the spleen due to its ability to destroy the growth
and proliferation of tumour cells.
4.
Immune surveillance exists is substantiated by increased
frequency of cancers in immunodeficient host e.g. in AIDS
patients, or development of post-transplant lymphoprolife-
rative disease.
In an attempt to substantiate the above observations and
to understand the underlying host defense mechanisms,
experimental animal studies involving tumour transplants
were carried out. The findings of animal experiments coupled
with research on human cancers has led to the concept of
immunology of cancer discussed under the following
headings:
1.
Tumour antigens
2.
Antitumour immune responses
3
Immunotherapy.
1.
TUMOUR ANTIGENS. Tumour cells express surface
antigens which have been seen in animals and in some
human tumours. Older classification of tumour antigens was
based on their surface sharing characteristics on normal
versus tumour cells and on their recognition by cytotoxic T
lymphocytes CTL (CD8+T cells) on the basis of class I MHC
molecules. Accordingly, tumour antigens were categorised
into following two types:
i)
Tumour-specific antigens (TSAs) located on tumour cells
and are unique or specific antigens for particular tumour and
not shared by normal cells.
ii) Tumour associated antigens (TAAs) are present on tumour
cells as well as on some normal cells from where the tumour
originated.
However, it is now known that TSAs and TAAs can both
be present on normal cells and categorisation into TSA and
TAA does not hold true. Thus, presently distinction of
tumour antigens is based on their recognition by the host
immune cells, i.e. CD8+ T cells (CTL), and by the molecular
structure of the tumour antigens. Currently, various groups
of tumour antigens are as follows:
1. Oncoproteins from mutated oncogenes: Protein products
derived from mutated oncogenes result in expression of cell
surface antigens on tumour cells. The examples include
products of RAS, BCL/ABL and CDK4.
2. Protein products of tumour suppressor genes. In some tumours,
protein products of mutated tumour suppressor genes cause
expression of tumour antigens on the cell surface. The
examples are mutated proteins p53 and β-catenin.
3. Overexpressed cellular proteins. Some tumours are associated
with a normal cellular protein but is excessively expressed
in tumour cells and incite host immune response. For
example, in melanoma the tumour antigen is structurally
normal melanocyte specific protein, tyrosinase, which is
overexpressed compared with normal cells. Similarly, HER2/
neu protein is overexpressed in many cases of breast cancer.
4. Abnormally expressed cellular proteins. Sometimes, a cellular
protein is present in some normal cells but is abnormally
expressed on the surface of tumour cells of some cancers.
The classic example is presence of MAGE gene silent in
normal adult tissues except in male germ line but MAGE
genes are expressed on surface of many tumours such as
melanoma (abbreviation MAGE from ‘melanoma antigen’ in
which it was first found), cancers of liver, lung, stomach and
oesophagus. Other examples of similar aberrantly expressed
gene products in cancers are GAGE (G antigen), BAGE (B
melanoma antigen) and RAGE (renal tumour antigen).
5. Tumour antigens from viral oncoproteins. As already
discussed above, many oncogenic viruses express viral
oncoproteins which result in expression of antigens on
tumour cells e.g. viral oncoproteins of HPV (E6, E7) in cervical
cancer and EBNA proteins of EBV in Burkitt’s lymphoma.
6. Tumour antigens from randomly mutated genes. Various other
carcinogens such as chemicals and radiation induce random
mutations in the target cells. These mutated cells elaborate
protein products targeted by the CTL of the immune system
causing expression of tumour antigens.
7. Cell specific differentiation antigens. Normally differentiated
cells have cellular antigens which forms the basis of
diagnostic immunohistochemistry. Cancers have varying
degree of loss of differentiation but particular lineage of the
tumour cells can be identified by tumour antigens. For
example, various CD markers for various subtypes of
lymphomas, prostate specific antigen (PSA) in carcinoma of
prostate.
8. Oncofoetal antigens. Oncofoetal antigens such as α-
foetoprotein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are
normally expressed in embryonic life. But these antigens
appear in certain cancers—AFP in liver cancer and CEA in
colon cancer which can be detected in serum as cancer
markers.
9. Abnormal cell surface molecules. The normal cell expresses
surface molecules of glycolipids, glycoproteins, mucins and
blood group antigens. In some cancers, there is abnormally
changed expression of these molecules. For example, there
may be changed blood group antigen, or abnormal
expression of mucin in ovarian cancer (CA-125) and in breast
cancer (MUC-1).
2.
ANTI-TUMOUR IMMUNE RESPONSES. Although the
host immune response to tumour is by both cell-mediated
and humoral immunity, the major anti-tumour effector
mechanism is cell-mediated.
i)
Cell-mediated mechanism. This is the main mechanism
of destruction of tumour cells by the host. The following
cellular responses can destroy the tumour cells and induce
tumour immunity in humans:
a) Specifically sensitised cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) i.e.
CD8+ T cells are directly cytotoxic to the target cell and
require contact between them and tumour cells. CTL have
been found to be effective against virally-induced cancers
e.g. in Burkitt’s lymphoma (EBV-induced), invasive
squamous cell carcinoma of cervix (HPV-induced).
b) Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes which after
activation by IL-2, destroy tumour cells without sensitisation,
either directly or by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
(ADCC). NK cells together with T lymphocytes are the first
line of defense against tumour cells and can lyse tumour cells.
c)  Macrophages are activated by interferon-γ secreted by
T-cells and NK-cells, and therefore there is close collaboration

230
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
of these two subpopulation of lymphocytes and
macrophages. Activated macrophages mediate cytotoxicity
by production of oxygen free radicals or by tumour necrosis
factor.
ii) Humoral mechanism. As such there are no anti-tumour
humoral antibodies which are effective against cancer cells
in vivo. However, in vitro humoral antibodies may kill
tumour cells by complement activation or by antibody-
dependent cytotoxicity. Based on this, monoclonal antibody
treatment is offered to cases of some non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma.
iii) Immune regulatory mechanism. In spite of host immune
responses, most cancers grow relentlessly. This is due to some
of the following controlling mechanisms:
a) During progression of the cancer, immunogenic cells may
disappear.
b) Cytotoxic T-cells and NK-cells may play a self regulatory
role.
c)
Immunosuppression mediated by various acquired
carcinogenic agents (viruses, chemicals, radiation).
d) Immunosuppressive role of factors secreted by tumour
cells e.g. transforming growth factor-β.
The mechanisms of these immune responses are
schematically illustrated in Fig. 8.28.
3.
IMMUNOTHERAPY. Despite the existence of anti-
tumour immune responses, the cancers still progress and
eventually cause death of the host. The immune responses
to be effective enough must eliminate the cancer cells more
rapidly than their rate of proliferation and hence the role of
boosting the immune response or immunotherapy.
i)
Non-specific stimulation of the host immune response
was initially attempted with BCG, Corynebacterium parvum
and levamisole, but except slight effect in acute lymphoid
leukaemia, it failed to have any significant influence in any
other tumour.
ii) Specific stimulation of the immune system was attemp-
ted next by immunising the host with irradiated tumour cells
but failed to yield desired results because if the patient’s
tumour within the body failed to stimulate effective
immunity, the implanted cells of the same tumour are
unlikely to do so.
iii) Current status of immunotherapy is focussed on
following three main approaches:
a) Cellular immunotherapy consists of infusion of tumour-
specific cytotoxic T cells which will increase the population
of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). The patient’s
peripheral blood lymphocytes are cultured with interleukin-
2 which generates lymphokine-activated killer cells having
potent anti-tumour effect.
b) Cytokine therapy is used to build up specific and non-
specific host defenses. These include: interleukin-2,
interferon-α and -γ, tumour necrosis factor-α, and
granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF).
c)
Monoclonal antibody therapy is currently being tried against
CD20 molecule of B cells in certain B cell leukaemias and
lymphomas.
EFFECT OF TUMOUR ON HOST
Malignant tumours produce more ill-effects than the benign
tumours. The effects may be local, or generalised and more
widespread.
1.
LOCAL EFFECTS. Both benign and malignant tumours
cause local effects on the host due to their size or location.
Malignant tumours due to rapid and invasive growth
potential have more serious effects. Some of the local effects
of tumours are as under:
i)
Compression. Many benign tumours pose only a
cosmetic problem. Some benign tumours, however, due to
their critical location, have more serious consequences e.g.
pituitary adenoma may lead to serious endocrinopathy; a
small benign tumour in ampulla of Vater may lead to biliary
obstruction.
ii) Mechanical obstruction. Benign and malignant tumours
in the gut may produce intestinal obstruction.
iii) Tissue destruction. Malignant tumours, both primary
and metastatic, infiltrate and destroy the vital structures.
iv) Infarction, ulceration, haemorrhage. Cancers have a
greater tendency to undergo infarction, surface ulceration
and haemorrhage than the benign tumours. Secondary
bacterial infection may supervene. Large tumours in mobile
organs (e.g. an ovarian tumour) may undergo torsion and
produce infarction and haemorrhage.
2.
CANCER CACHEXIA. Patients with advanced and
disseminated cancers terminally have asthenia (emaciation),
and anorexia, together referred to as cancer cachexia
(meaning wasting). Exact mechanism of cachexia is not clear
but it does not occur due to increased nutritional demands
of the tumour. Possibly, cachectin or tumour necrosis factor
α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 derived from macrophages play
a contributory role in cachexia. Various other causes include
necrosis, ulceration, haemorrhage, infection, malabsorption,
anxiety, pain, insomnia, hypermetabolism and pyrexia.

FEVER. Fever of unexplained origin may be presenting
feature in some malignancies such as in Hodgkin’s disease,
adenocarcinoma kidney, osteogenic sarcoma and many other
tumours. The exact mechanism of tumour associated fever
is not known but probably the tumour cells themselves
elaborate pyrogens.
4.
TUMOUR LYSIS SYNDROME. This is a condition
caused by extensive destruction of a large number of rapidly
proliferating tumour cells. The condition is seen more often
in cases of lymphomas and leukaemias than solid tumours
and may be due to large tumour burden (e.g. in Burkitt’s
lymphoma), chemotherapy, administration of glucocorti-
coids or certain hormonal agents (e.g. tamoxifen). It is
characterised by hyperuricaemia, hyperkalaemia,
hyperphosphataemia and hypocalcaemia, all of which may
result in acidosis and renal failure.
5.
PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROMES. Paraneoplastic
syndromes (PNS) are a group of conditions developing in
patients with advanced cancer which are neither explained
by direct and distant spread of the tumour, nor by the usual
hormone elaboration by the tissue of origin of the tumour.
About 10 to 15% of the patients with advanced cancer develop
one or more of the syndromes included in the PNS. Rarely,
PNS may be the earliest manifestation of a latent cancer.
The various clinical syndromes included in the PNS are
as summarised in Table 8.11 and are briefly outlined below:

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
i)
Endocrine syndrome. Elaboration of hormones or
hormone-like substances by cancer cells of non-endocrine
origin is called as ectopic hormone production. Some
examples are given below:
a) Hypercalcaemia. Symptomatic hypercalcaemia unrelated
to hyperparathyroidism is the most common syndrome in
PNS. It occurs from elaboration of parathormone-like
substance by tumours such as squamous cell carcinoma of
the lung, carcinoma kidney, breast and adult T cell leukaemia
lymphoma.
b) Cushing’s syndrome. About 10% patients of small cell
carcinoma of the lung elaborate ACTH or ACTH-like
substance producing Cushing’s syndrome. In addition, cases
with pancreatic carcinoma and neurogenic tumours may be
associated with Cushing’s syndrome.
c)
Polycythaemia. Secretion of erythropoietin by certain
tumours such as renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular
carcinoma and cerebellar haemangioma may cause
polycythaemia.
d) Hypoglycaemia. Elaboration of insulin-like substance by
fibrosarcomas, islet cell tumours of pancreas and
mesothelioma may cause hypoglycaemia.
ii) Neuromyopathic syndromes. About 5% of cancers are
associated with progressive destruction of neurons
throughout the nervous system without evidence of
metastasis in the brain and spinal cord. This is probably medi-
ated by immunologic mechanisms. The changes in the
neurons may affect the muscles as well. The changes are:
peripheral neuropathy, cortical cerebellar degeneration,
myasthenia gravis syndrome, polymyositis.
iii) Effects on osseous, joints and soft tissue. e.g. hyper-
trophic osteoarthropathy and clubbing of fingers in cases of
bronchogenic carcinoma by unknown mechanism.
iv) Haematologic and vascular syndrome. e.g. venous
thrombosis (Trousseau’s phenomenon), non-bacterial
thrombotic endocarditis, disseminated intravascular coagu-
lation (DIC), leukemoid reaction and normocytic normo-
chromic anaemia occurring in advanced cancers. Auto-
immune haemolytic anaemia may be associated with B-cell
malignancies.
v) Gastrointestinal syndromes. Malabsorption of various
dietary components as well as hypoalbuminaemia may be
associated with a variety of cancers which do not directly
involve small bowel.
vi) Renal syndromes. Renal vein thrombosis or systemic
amyloidosis may produce nephrotic syndrome in patients
with cancer.
vii) Cutaneous syndromes. Acanthosis nigricans charac-
terised by the appearance of black warty lesions in the axillae
and the groins may appear in the course of adenocarcinoma
of gastrointestinal tract. Other cutaneous lesions in PNS
include seborrheric dermatitis in advanced malignant
tumours and exfoliative dermatitis in lymphomas and
Hodgkin’s disease.
viii)
Amyloidosis. Primary amyloid deposits may occur
in multiple myeloma whereas renal cell carcinoma and other
solid tumours may be associated with secondary systemic
amyloidosis.
PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER
When the diagnosis of cancer is suspected on clinical
examination and on other investigations, it must be
confirmed. The most certain and reliable method which has
stood the test of time is the histological examination of biopsy,
though recently many other methods to arrive at the correct
diagnosis or confirm the histological diagnosis are available
which are discussed in Chapter 2.
1. Histological Methods
These methods are based on microscopic examination of
properly fixed tissue (excised tumour mass or open/needle
biopsy from the mass), supported with complete clinical and
investigative data. These methods are most valuable in
arriving at the accurate diagnosis. The tissue must be fixed
in 10% formalin for light microscopic examination and in
glutaraldehyde for electron microscopic studies, while quick-
frozen section and hormonal analysis are carried out on fresh
unfixed tissues.
The histological diagnosis by either of these methods is
made on the basis that morphological features of benign
tumours resemble those of normal tissue and that they are
unable to invade and metastasise, while malignant tumours
are identified by lack of differentiation in cancer cells termed
‘anaplasia’ or ‘cellular atypia’ and may invade as well as
metastasise. The light microscopic and ultrastructural
characteristics of neoplastic cell have been described in earlier
part of this chapter.
2. Cytological Methods
These are discussed in detail in Chapter 11.
Cytological methods for diagnosis consist of study of cells
shed off into body cavities (exfoliative cytology) and study
of cells by putting a fine needle introduced under vacuum
into the lesion (fine needle aspiration cytology, FNAC).
i)
Exfoliative cytology. Cytologic smear (Papanicolaou or
Pap smear) method was initially employed for detecting
dysplasia, carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma of the
uterine cervix. However, its use has now been widely
extended to include examination of sputum and bronchial
washings; pleural, peritoneal and pericardial effusions; urine,
gastric secretions, and CSF. The method is based on
microscopic identification of the characteristics of malignant
cells which are incohesive and loose and are thus shed off or
‘exfoliated’ into the lumen. However, a ‘negative diagnosis’
does not altogether rule out malignancy due to possibility of
sampling error.
ii) Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Currently,
cytopathology includes not only study of exfoliated cells but
also materials obtained from superficial and deep-seated
lesions in the body which do not shed off cells freely. The
latter method consists of study of cells obtained by a fine
needle introduced under vacuum into the lesion, so called

233
CHAPTER 8
Neoplasia
fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). The superficial masses
can be aspirated under direct vision while deep-seated
masses such as intra-abdominal, pelvic organs and
retroperitoneum are frequently investigated by ultrasound
(US) or computed tomography (CT)-guided fine needle
aspirations. The smears are fixed in 95% ethanol by wet
fixation, or may be air-dried unfixed. While Papanicolaou
method of staining is routinely employed in most laboratories
for wet fixed smears, others prefer H and E due to similarity
in staining characteristics in the sections obtained by paraffin-
embedding. Air-dried smears are stained by May-Grunwald-
Giemsa or Leishman stain. FNAC has a diagnostic reliability
between 80-97% but it must not be substituted for clinical
judgement or compete with an indicated histopathologic
biopsy.
3. Histochemistry and Cytochemistry
Histochemistry and cytochemistry are additional diagnostic
tools which help the pathologist in identifying the chemical
composition of cells, their constituents and their products
by special staining methods.
Though immunohistochemical techniques are more
useful for tumour diagnosis (see below), histochemical and
cytochemical methods are still employed for this purpose.
Some of the common examples are summarised in
Table 8.12, while the subject is discussed at length in
Chapter 2.
4. Immunohistochemistry
This is an immunological method of recognising a cell by
one or more of its specific components in the cell membrane,
cytoplasm or nucleus. These cell components (called
antigens) combine with specific antibodies on the formalin-

regions (NORs)
fixed paraffin sections or cytological smears. The complex
of antigen-antibody on slide is made visible for light
microscopic identification by either fluorescent dyes (‘fluoro-
chromes’) or by enzyme system (‘chromogens’). The specific
antibody against a particular cellular antigen is obtained by
hybridoma technique for monoclonal antibody production.
These monoclonal antibodies, besides being specific against
antigen, are highly sensitive in detection of antigenic
component, and, therefore, impart objectivity to the
subjective tumour diagnosis made by the surgical
pathologist.
Though the list of immunohistochemical stains is ever
increasing, an important group of antibody stains directed
against various classes of intermediate filaments is useful in
classification of poorly-differentiated tumours of epithelial
or mesenchymal origin (Table 8.13). This subject is discussed
already in Chapter 2 and an abbreviated list of antibody stains
in some common cancers of unknown origin is given in
Table 2.3.
5. Electron Microscopy
Ultrastructural examination of tumour cells offers selective
role in diagnostic pathology. EM examination may be helpful
in confirming or substantiating a tumour diagnosis arrived
at by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry. A few
general features of malignant tumour cells by EM
examination can be appreciated:
i)
Cell junctions, their presence and type.
ii) Cell surface, e.g. presence of microvilli.
iii) Cell shape and cytoplasmic extensions.
iv) Shape of the nucleus and features of nuclear membrane.
v) Nucleoli, their size and density.
vi) Cytoplasmic organelles—their number is generally
reduced.
vii)  Dense bodies in the cytoplasm.
viii) Any other secretory product in the cytoplasm e.g.
melanosomes in melanoma and membrane-bound granules
in endocrine tumours.
6. Tumour Markers (Biochemical Assays)
In order to distinguish from the preceding techniques of
tumour diagnosis in which ‘stains’ are imparted on the
tumour cells in section or smear, tumour markers are
biochemical assays of products elaborated by the tumour
cells in blood or other body fluids. It is, therefore, pertinent
to keep in mind that many of these products are produced
by normal body cells too, and thus the biochemical estimation
of the product in blood or other fluid reflects the total
substance and not by the tumour cells alone. These methods,
therefore, lack sensitivity as well as specificity and can only
be employed for the following:
Firstly, as an adjunct to the pathologic diagnosis arrived
at by other methods and not for primary diagnosis of cancer.
Secondly, it can be used for prognostic and therapeutic
purposes.
Tumour markers include: cell surface antigens (or
oncofoetal antigens), cytoplasmic proteins, enzymes,

234
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
hormones and cancer antigens; these are listed in Table 8.14.
However, two of the best known examples of oncofoetal
antigens secreted by foetal tissues as well as by tumours are
alpha-foetoproteins (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigens
(CEA):
a) Alpha-foetoprotein (AFP): This is a glycoprotein
synthesised normally by foetal liver cells. Their serum levels
are elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma and non-
seminomatous germ cell tumours of the testis. Certain non-
neoplastic conditions also have increased serum levels of AFP
e.g. in hepatitis, cirrhosis, toxic liver injury and pregnancy.
b) Carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA): CEA is also a
glycoprotein normally synthesised in embryonic tissue of the
gut, pancreas and liver. Their serum levels are high in cancers
of the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and breast. As in AFP,
CEA levels are also elevated in certain non-neoplastic
conditions e.g. in ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, hepatitis
and chronic bronchitis.
7. Other Modern Aids in Pathologic
Diagnosis of Tumours
In addition to the methods described above, some other
modern diagnostic techniques have emerged for tumour
diagnostic pathology but their availability as well as
applicability are limited. These methods are discussed in
Chapter 2. Briefly, their role in tumour diagnosis is outlined
below.
i)
Flow cytometry. This is a computerised technique by
which the detailed characteristics of individual tumour cells
are recognised and quantified and the data can be stored for
subsequent comparison too. Since for flow cytometry, single
cell suspensions are required to ‘flow’ through the
‘cytometer’, it can be employed on blood cells and their
precursors in bone marrow aspirates and body fluids, and
sometimes on fresh-frozen unfixed tissue. The method
employs either identification of cell surface antigen (e.g. in
classification of leukaemias and lymphomas), or by the DNA
content analysis (e.g. aneuploidy in various cancers).
ii) In situ hybridisation. This is a molecular technique by
which nucleic acid sequences (cellular/viral DNA and RNA)
can be localised by specifically-labelled nucleic acid probe
directly in the intact cell (in situ) rather than by DNA
extraction (see below). A modification of in situ hybridisation
technique is fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) in which
fluorescence dyes applied and is used to detect
microdeletions, subtelomere deletions and to look for
alterations in chromosomal numbers. In situ hybridisation
may be used for analysis of certain human tumours by the
study of oncogenes aside from its use in diagnosis of viral
infection.

iii) Molecular diagnostic techniques. The group of mole-
cular biologic methods in the tumour diagnostic laboratory
are a variety of DNA/RNA-based molecular techniques in
which the DNA/RNA are extracted (compared from in situ
above) from the cell and then analysed. These techniques
are highly sensitive, specific and rapid and have
revolutionised diagnostic pathology in neoplastic as well as
non-neoplastic conditions (e.g. in infectious and inherited
disorders, and in identity diagnosis). Molecular diagnostic
techniques include: DNA analysis by Southern blot, RNA
analysis by northern blot, and polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). The following techniques of molecular methods in
tumour diagnosis have applications in haematologic as well
as non-haematologic malignancies:
Analysis of molecular cytogenetic abnormalities
Mutational analysis
Antigen receptor gene rearrangement
Study of oncogenic viruses at molecular level.
Besides the application of these molecular techniques for
diagnosis of tumour, many of he newer molecular techniques
are being applied for predicting prognosis, biologic
behaviour of tumour, detection of minimal residual disease
and for hereditary predisposition of other family members
to develop a particular cancer.
iv) DNA microarray analysis of tumours. Currently, it is
possible to perform molecular profiling of a tumour by use
of gene chip technology which allows measurement of levels
of expression of several thousand genes (up-regulation or
down-regulation) simultaneously. Fluorescent labels are
used to code the cDNA synthesised by trigger from mRNA.
The conventional DNA probes are substituted by silicon chip
which contains the entire range of genes and high resolution
scanners are used for the measurement.

Environmental and
Nutritional Diseases
INTRODUCTION
The subject of environmental hazards to health has assumed
great significance in the modern world. In olden times, the
discipline of ‘tropical medicine’ was of interest to the
physician, largely due to contamination of air, food and water
by infectious and parasitic organisms. Subsequently, the
interest got focussed on ‘geographic pathology’ due to
occurrence of certain environment-related diseases confined
to geographic boundaries. Then emerged the knowledge of
‘occupational diseases’ caused by overexposure to a pollutant
by virtue of an individual’s occupation. Currently, the field
of ‘environmental pathology’ encompasses all such diseases
caused by progressive deterioration in the environment, most
of which is man-made. In addition, is the related problem of
over- and undernutrition.
Some of the important factors which have led to the
alarming environmental degradation are as under:
1.
Population explosion
2.
Urbanisation of rural and forest land to accommodate
the increasing numbers
3.
Accumulation of wastes
4.
Unsatisfactory disposal of radioactive waste
5.
Industrial effluents and automobile exhausts.
But the above atmospheric pollutants appear relatively
minor compared with voluntary intake of three pollutants—use
of tobacco, consumption of alcohol and intoxicant drugs. The
WHO estimates that 80% cases of cardiovascular disease and
type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 40% of all cancers are
preventable through ‘three pillars of prevention’: avoidance
of tobacco, healthy diet and physical activity. The WHO has
further determined that about a quarter of global burden of
diseases and 23% of all deaths are related to modifiable
environmental factors. Infant mortality related to
environmental factors in developing countries is 12 times
higher than in the developed countries.
Attempts at prohibition of alcohol in some states in India
have not been quite effective due to difficulty in implemen-
tation. Instead, prohibition has only resulted in off and on
catastrophe of ‘hooch tragedies’ in some parts of this country
due to illicit liquor consumption.
The present discussion on environmental and nutritional
diseases is covered under the following groups:
1.
Environmental pollution:
Air pollution
Tobacco smoking
2.
Chemical and drug injury:
Therapeutic (iatrogenic) drug injury
Non-therapeutic toxic agents (e.g. alcohol, lead, carbon
monoxide, drug abuse)
Environmental chemicals
3.
Injury by physical agents:
Thermal and electrical injury
Injury by ionising radiation
4.
Nutritional diseases:
Overnutrition (obesity)
Undernutrition (starvation, protein energy malnutrition,
vitamin deficiencies).
ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
Any agent—chemical, physical or microbial, that alters the
composition of environment is called pollutant. For survival
of mankind, it is important to prevent depletion of ozone
layer (O3) in the outer space from pollutants such as
chloroflurocarbons and nitrogen dioxide produced in
abundance by day-to-day activities on our planet earth due
to industrial effluent and automobile exhausts.
AIR POLLUTION
A vast variety of pollutants are inhaled daily, some of which
may cause trivial irritation to the upper respiratory path-
ways, while others may lead to acute or chronic injury to the
lungs, and some are implicated in causation of lung cancer.
Whereas some pollutants are prevalent in certain industries
(such as coal dust, silica, asbestos), others are general
pollutants present widespread in the ambient atmosphere
(e.g. sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide).
The latter group of environmental pollutants is acted upon
by sunlight to produce secondary pollutants such as ozone
and free radicals capable of oxidant cell injury to respiratory
passages. In highly polluted cities where coal consumption
and automobile exhaust accumulate in the atmosphere, the
air pollutants become visible as ‘smog’. It has been reported
that 6 out of 10 largest cities in India have such severe air
pollution problem that the annual level of suspended
particles is about three times higher than the WHO standards.
An estimated 50,000 persons die prematurely every year due
to high level of pollution in these cities.
The adverse effects of air pollutants on lung depend upon
a few variables that include:
longer duration of exposure;
total dose of exposure;
impaired ability of the host to clear inhaled particles; and
particle size of 1-5 μm capable of getting impacted in the
distal airways to produce tissue injury.

237
CHAPTER 9
Environmental and Nutritional Diseases
Pneumoconiosis—the group of lung diseases due to
occupational over-exposure to pollutants is discussed in
Chapter 17.
TOBACCO SMOKING
Habits
Tobacco smoking is the most prevalent and preventable cause
of disease and death. The harmful effects of smoking pipe
and cigar are somewhat less. Long-term smokers of filter-
tipped cigarettes appear to have 30-50% lower risk of
development of cancer due to reduced inhalation of tobacco
smoke constituents.
In India, a country of 1.2 billion people, a quarter (300
million) are tobacco users in one form or the other (Fig. 9.1).
Smoking bidis and chewing pan masala, zarda and gutka are
more widely practiced than cigarettes. Habit of smoking
chutta (a kind of indigenous cigar) in which the lighted end
is put in mouth is practiced in the Indian state of Andhra
Pradesh and is associated with higher incidence of squamous
cell carcinoma of hard palate. Another habit prevalent in
Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and in parts of Sri
Lanka is chewing of tabacco alone or mixed with slaked lime
as a bolus of paan kept in mouth for long hours which is the
major cause of cancer of upper aerodigestive tract and oral
cavity.  Hookah smoking, in which tobacco smoke passes
through a water-filled chamber which cools the smoke before
it is inhaled by the smoker, is believed by some reports to
deliver less tar and nicotine than cigarettes and hence fewer
tobacco-related health consequences. In view of serious
health hazards of tobacco, India has recently succeeded in
enacting a law with effect from 2nd October 2008, Mahatma
Gandhi’s birth anniversary, banning smoking at all public
places, imposing world’s biggest smoking ban. If implemen-
tation of this ban is effective, it is likely to have a favourable
impact in coming years on the public health in this populous
country. In US, Canada and most European countries, health
awareness by people has resulted in decline in tobacco
smoking by about 20%.
Besides the harmful effects of smoking on active smokers
themselves, involuntary exposure of smoke to bystanders
(passive smoking) is also injurious to health, particularly to
infants and children.
Dose and Duration
Tobacco contains several harmful constituents which include
nicotine, many carcinogens, carbon monoxide and other
toxins (Table 9.1).
The harmful effects of smoking are related to a variety of
factors, the most important of which is dose of exposure
expressed in terms of pack years. For example, one pack of
cigarettes daily for 5 years means 5 pack years. It is estimated
that a person who smokes 2 packs of cigarettes daily at the
age of 30 years reduces his life by 8 years than a non-smoker.
On cessation of smoking, the higher mortality slowly declines
and the beneficial effect reaches the level of non-smokers after
20 or more of smoke-free years.
Tobacco-Related Diseases
Tobacco contains numerous toxic chemicals having adverse
effects varying from minor throat irritation to carcinogenesis.
Some of the important constituents of tobacco smoke with
adverse effects are given in Table 9.1.
The major diseases accounting for higher mortality in
tobacco smokers include the following (in descending order
of frequency):
i)
Coronary heart disease
ii) Cancer of the lung
iii) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Besides above, smokers suffer higher risk of development
of a few other cancers and non-neoplastic conditions as
illustrated in Fig. 9.2.
CORONARY HEART DISEASE. Cigarette smoking is one
of the four major risk factors for myocardial infarction and
acts synergistically with the other three—hypercholes-
terolaemia, hypertension and diabetes mellitus (Chapter 15).
There is more severe, extensive and accelerated athero-
sclerosis of coronary arteries and aorta in smokers, possibly
due to increased platelet aggregation and impaired lung
function that causes reduced myocardial oxygen supply.
Besides, the smokers have higher risk of development of
atherosclerotic aortic aneurysm and Buerger’s disease
(thromboangiitis obliterans) affecting lower extremities
(Chapter 15).
LUNG CANCER. This is the most common cancer in men
throughout world and most frequent cancer in women too

breast cancer in that country. Cigarette smoking is strongly
implicated in evolution of lung cancer as described in
Chapter 17.
OTHER CANCERS. Besides lung cancer, smokers have
higher risk of development of cancer of upper aerodigestive
tract (lips, oral cavity, larynx, oesophagus), pancreas, urinary
bladder and kidney.
NON-NEOPLASTIC DISEASES. These include the
following:
i)
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that
includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema as the most
common.
ii) Peptic ulcer disease with 70% higher risk in smokers.
iii) Early menopause in smoker women.
iv) In smoking pregnant women, higher risk of lower birth
weight of foetus, higher perinatal mortality and intellectual
deterioration of newborn.
CHEMICAL AND DRUG INJURY
During life, each one of us is exposed to a variety of chemicals
and drugs. These are broadly divided into the following three
categories:
Therapeutic (iatrogenic) agents e.g. drugs, which when
administered indiscriminately are associated with adverse
effects.
Non-therapeutic agents e.g. alcohol, lead, carbon monoxide,
drug abuse.
Environmental chemicals e.g. long-term or accidental
exposure to certain man-made or naturally-occurring
chemicals.
THERAPEUTIC (IATROGENIC) DRUG INJURY
Though the basis of patient management is rational drug
therapy, nevertheless adverse drug reactions do occur in 2-
5% of patients. In general, the risk of adverse drug reaction
increases with increasing number of drugs administered.
Adverse effects of drugs may appear due to:
overdose;
genetic predisposition;
exaggerated pharmacologic response;
interaction with other drugs; and
unknown factors.
It is beyond the scope of this book to delve into the list of
drugs with their harmful effects. However, some of the
common forms of iatrogenic drug injury and the offending
drugs are listed in Table 9.2.
NON-THERAPEUTIC TOXIC AGENTS
ALCOHOLISM
Chronic alcoholism is defined as the regular imbibing of an
amount of ethyl alcohol (ethanol) that is sufficient to harm
an individual socially, psychologically or physically. It is
difficult to give the number of ‘drinks’ after which the
diagnosis of alcoholism can be made because of differences
in individual susceptibility. However, adverse effects—acute
as well as chronic, are related to the quantity of alcohol
content imbibed and duration of consumption. Generally,
10 gm of ethanol is present in:
a can of beer (or half a bottle of beer);
120 ml of neat wine; or
30 ml of 43% liquor (small peg).
A daily consumption of 40 gm of ethanol (4 small pegs
or 2 large pegs) is likely to be harmful but intake of 100 gm
or more daily is certainly dangerous. Daily and heavy
consumption of alcohol is more harmful than moderate social
drinking since the liver, where ethanol is metabolised, gets
time to heal.
Metabolism
Absorption of alcohol begins in the stomach and small
intestine and appears in blood shortly after ingestion. Alcohol
is then distributed to different organs and body fluids
proportionate to the blood levels of alcohol. About 2-10% of
absorbed alcohol is excreted via urine, sweat and exhaled
through breath, the last one being the basis of breath test
employed by law-enforcement agencies for alcohol abuse.
Metabolism of alcohol is discussed in detail in Chapter 21;
in brief alcohol is metabolised in the liver by the following 3
pathways (Fig. 9.3):
By the major rate-limiting pathway of alcohol
dehydrogenase (ADH) in the cytosol, which is then quickly
destroyed by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), especially
with low blood alcohol levels.

neoplastic diseases associated with smoking, numbered serially in order

CHAPTER 9
Environmental and Nutritional Diseases
Via microsomal P-450 system (microsomal ethanol
oxidising system, MEOS) when the blood alcohol level is
high.
Minor pathway via catalase from peroxisomes.
In any of the three pathways, ethanol is biotransformed
to toxic acetaldehyde in the liver and finally to carbon dioxide
and water by acetyl coenzyme A.
Ill-Effects of Alcoholism
Alcohol consumption in moderation and socially acceptable
limits is practiced mainly for its mood-altering effects. Heavy
alcohol consumption in unhabituated person is likely to cause
acute ill-effects on different organs. Though the diseases
associated with alcoholism are discussed in respective
chapters later, the spectrum of ill-effects are outlined below.
A. ACUTE ALCOHOLISM. The acute effects of inebriation
are most prominent on the central nervous system but it also
injures the stomach and liver.
1.
Central nervous system. Alcohol acts as a CNS depres-
sant; the intensity of effects of alcohol on the CNS are related
to the quantity consumed and duration over which
consumed, which are reflected by the blood levels of alcohol:
Initial effect of alcohol is on subcortical structures which
is followed by disordered cortical function, motor ataxia and
behavioural changes. These changes are apparent when
blood alcohol levels do not exceed 100 mg/dl which is the
upper limit of sobriety in drinking as defined by law-
enforcing agencies in most Western countries while dealing
with cases of driving in drunken state.
Blood levels of 100-200 mg/dl are associated with
depression of cortical centres, lack of coordination, impaired
judgement and drowsiness.
Stupor and coma supervene when blood alcohol levels
are about 300 mg/dl.
Blood levels of alcohol above 400 mg/dl can cause
anaesthesia, depression of medullary centre and death from
respiratory arrest.
However, chronic alcoholics develop CNS tolerance and
adaptation and, therefore, can withstand higher blood levels
of alcohol without such serious effects.
2.
Stomach. Acute alcohol intoxication may cause vomiting,
acute gastritis and peptic ulceration.
3.
Liver. Acute alcoholic injury to the liver is explained in
Chapter 21.
B. CHRONIC ALCOHOLISM. Chronic alcoholism
produces widespread injury to organs and systems. Contrary
to the earlier belief that chronic alcoholic injury results from
nutritional deficiencies, it is now known that most of the
alcohol-related injury to different organs is due to toxic effects
of alcohol and accumulation of its main toxic metabolite,
acetaldehyde, in the blood. Other proposed mechanisms of
tissue injury in chronic alcoholism is free-radical mediated
injury and genetic susceptibility to alcohol-dependence and
tissue damage.
Some of the more important organ effects in chronic
alcoholism are as under (Fig. 9.4):
1.
Liver. Alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis are the most
common and important effects of chronic alcoholism
(Chapter 21).

Pancreas. Chronic calcifying pancreatitis and acute
pancreatitis are serious complications of chronic alcoholism.
3.
Gastrointestinal tract. Gastritis, peptic ulcer and
oesophageal varices associated with fatal massive bleeding
may occur.
4.
Central nervous system. Peripheral neuropathies and
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, cerebral atrophy, cerebellar
degeneration and amblyopia (impaired vision) are seen in
chronic alcoholics.
5.
Cardiovascular system. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy and
beer-drinkers’ myocardiosis with consequent dilated
cardiomyopathy may occur. Level of HDL (atherosclerosis-
protective lipoprotein), however, has been shown to increase
with moderate consumption of alcohol.
6.
Endocrine system. In men, testicular atrophy, femi-
nisation, loss of libido and potency, and gynaecomastia may
develop. These effects appear to be due to lowering of
testosterone levels.
7.
Blood. Haematopoietic dysfunction with secondary
megaloblastic anaemia and increased red blood cell volume
may occur.
8.
Immune system. Alcoholics are more susceptible to
various infections.
9.
Cancer. There is higher incidence of cancers of upper
aerodigestive tract in chronic alcoholics but the mechanism
is not clear.
LEAD POISONING
Lead poisoning may occur in children or adults due to
accidental or occupational ingestion.
In children, following are the main sources of lead poisoning:
Chewing of lead-containing furniture items, toys or
pencils.
Eating of lead paint flakes from walls.
In adults, the sources are as follows:
Occupational exposure to lead during spray painting,
recycling of automobile batteries (lead oxide fumes), mining,
and extraction of lead.
Accidental exposure by contaminated water supply,
house freshly coated with lead paint, and sniffing of lead-
containing petrol (hence unleaded petrol introduced as fuel).
Lead is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract or
lungs. The absorbed lead is distributed in two types of tissues
(Fig. 9.5):
a) Bones, teeth, nails and hair representing relatively harmless
pool of lead. About 90% of absorbed lead accumulates in the
developing metaphysis of bones in children and appears as
areas of increased bone densities (‘lead lines’) on X-ray. Lead
lines are also seen in the gingiva.

241
CHAPTER 9
Environmental and Nutritional Diseases
b) Brain, liver, kidneys and bone marrow accumulate the
remaining 10% lead which is directly toxic to these organs.
It is excreted via kidneys.
Lead toxicity occurs in the following organs predo-
minantly:
1.
Nervous system: The changes are as under:
In children, lead encephalopathy; oedema of brain,
flattening of gyri and compression of ventricles.
In adults, demyelinating peripheral motor neuropathy
which typically affects radial and peroneal nerves resulting
in wristdrop and footdrop respectively.
2.
Haematopoietic system: The changes in blood are quite
characteristic:
Microcytic hypochromic anaemia due to inhibition of two
enzymes: delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydrogenase required
for haem synthesis, and through inhibition of ferroketolase
required for incorporation of ferrous iron into the porphyrin
ring.
Prominent basophilic stippling of erythrocytes.
3.
Kidneys: Lead is toxic to proximal tubular cells of the
kidney and produces lead nephropathy characterised by
accumulation of intranuclear inclusion bodies consisting of
lead-protein complex in the proximal tubular cells.
4.
Gastrointestinal tract: Lead toxicity in the bowel
manifests as acute abdomen presenting as lead colic.
CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless and odourless gas
produced by incomplete combustion of carbon. Sources of
CO gas are:
automobile exhaust;
burning of fossil fuel in industries or at home; and
tobacco smoke.
CO is an important cause of accidental death due to
systemic oxygen deprivation of tissues. This is because
haemoglobin has about 200-times higher affinity for CO than
for O2 and thus varying amount of carboxyhaemoglobin is
formed depending upon the extent of CO poisoning. Besides,
carboxyhaemoglobin interferes with the release of O2 from
oxyhaemoglobin causing further aggravation of tissue
hypoxia. Diagnosis of CO poisoning is, therefore, best
confirmed by carboxyhaemoglobin levels in the blood.
CO poisoning may present in 2 ways:
Acute CO poisoning in which there is sudden
development of brain hypoxia characterised by oedema and
petechial haemorrhages.
Chronic CO poisoning presents with nonspecific changes
of slowly developing hypoxia of the brain.
DRUG ABUSE
Drug abuse is defined as the use of certain drugs for the
purpose of ‘mood alteration’ or ‘euphoria’ or ‘kick’ but
subsequently leading to habit-forming, dependence and
eventually addiction. Some of the commonly abused drugs
and substances are as under:
1.
Marijuana or ‘pot’ is psychoactive substance most widely
used. It is obtained from the leaves of the plant Cannabis sativa
and contains tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). It may be smoked
or ingested.
2.
Derivatives of opium that includes heroin and morphine.
Opioids are derived from the poppy plant. Heroin and
morphine are self-administered intravenously or
subcutaneously.
3.
CNS depressants include barbiturates, tranquilisers and
alcohol.
4.
CNS stimulants e.g. cocaine and amphetamines.
5.
Psychedelic drugs (meaning enjoyable perception-giving)
e.g. LSD.
6.
lnhalants e.g. glue, paint thinner, nail polish remover,
aerosols, amyl nitrite.
It is beyond the scope of the present discussion to go into
the pharmacologic actions of all these substances. However,
apart from pharmacologic and physiologic actions of these
street drugs, the most common complication is introduction
of infection by parenteral use of many of these drugs. Sharing
of needles by the drug-addicts accounts for high risk of most
feared viral infections in them, AIDS and viral hepatitis (both
HBV and HCV). Following are a few common drug abuse-
related infectious complications:
1.
At the site of injection—cellulitis, abscesses, ulcers,
thrombosed veins
2.
Thrombophlebitis
3.
Bacterial endocarditis
4.
High risk for AIDS
5.
Viral hepatitis and its complications
6.
Focal glomerulonephritis
7.
Talc (foreign body) granuloma formation in the lungs.

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICALS
A large number of chemicals are found as contaminants in
the ecosystem, food and water supply and find their way
into the food chain of man. These substances exert their toxic
effects depending upon their mode of absorption,
distribution, metabolism and excretion. Some of the
substances are directly toxic while others cause ill-effects via
their metabolites. Environmental chemicals may have slow
damaging effect or there may be sudden accidental exposure
such as the Bhopal gas tragedy in India due to accidental
leakage of methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas in December 1984.
Some of the common examples of environmental
chemicals are given below:
1.
Agriculture chemicals. Modern agriculture thrives on
pesticides, fungicides, herbicides and organic fertilisers
which may pose a potential acute poisoning as well as long-
term hazard. The problem is particularly alarming in
developing countries like India, China and Mexico where
farmers and their families are unknowingly exposed to these
hazardous chemicals during aerial spraying of crops.
Acute poisoning by organophosphate insecticides is quite
well known in India as accidental or suicidal poison by
inhibiting acetyl cholinesterase and sudden death.
Chronic human exposure to low level agricultural
chemicals is implicated in cancer, chronic degenerative
diseases, congenital malformations and impotence but the
exact cause-and-effect relationship is lacking.
According to the WHO estimates, about 7.5 lakh people
are taken ill every year worldwide with pesticide poisoning,
half of which occur in the developing countries due to ready
availability and indiscriminate use of hazardous pesticides
which are otherwise banned in advanced countries. Pesticide
residues in food items such as in fruits, vegetables, cereals,
grains, pulses etc is of greatest concern.
2.
Volatile organic solvents. Volatile organic solvents and
vapours are used in industry quite commonly and their
exposure may cause acute toxicity or chronic hazard, often
by inhalation than by ingestion. Such substances include
methanol, chloroform, petrol, kerosene, benzene, ethylene
glycol, toluene etc.
3.
Metals. Pollution by occupational exposure to toxic
metals such as mercury, arsenic, cadmium, iron, nickel and
aluminium are important hazardous environmental
chemicals.
4.
Aromatic hydrocarbons. The halogenated aromatic
hydrocarbons containing polychlorinated biphenyl which are
contaminant in several preservatives, herbicides and
antibacterial agents are a chronic health hazard.
5.
Cyanide. Cyanide in the environment is released by
combustion of plastic, silk and is also present in cassava and
the seeds of apricots and wild cherries. Cyanide is a very
toxic chemical and kills by blocking cellular respiration by
binding to mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase.
6.
Environmental dusts. These substances causing
pneumoconioses are discussed in chapter 17 while those
implicated in cancer are discussed in Chapter 8.
INJURY BY PHYSICAL AGENTS
THERMAL AND ELECTRICAL INJURY
Thermal and electrical burns, fall in body temperature below
35°C (hypothermia) and elevation of body temperature above
41°C (hyperthermia), are all associated with tissue injury.
Hypothermia may cause focal injury as in frostbite, or
systemic injury and death as occurs on immersion in cold
water for varying time.
Hyperthermia likewise, may be localised as in cutaneous
burns, and systemic as occurs in fevers.
Thermal burns depending upon severity are categorised
into full thickness (third degree) and partial thickness (first
and second degree). The most serious complications of burns
are haemoconcentration, infections and contractures on
healing.
Electrical burns may cause damage firstly, by electrical
dysfunction of the conduction system of the heart and death
by ventricular fibrillation, and secondly by heat produced by
electrical energy.
INJURY BY RADIATION
As discussed in the preceding chapter, the most important
form of radiation injury is ionising radiation which has three
types of effects on cells:
i)
Somatic effects which cause acute cell killing.
ii) Genetic damage by mutations and therefore, passes
genetic defects in the next progeny of cells.
iii) Malignant transformation of cells (Chapter 8).
Ionising radiation is widely employed for diagnostic
purpose as well as for radiotherapy of malignant tumours.
Radiation-induced cell death is mediated by radiolysis of
water in the cell with generation of toxic hydroxyl radicals
(page 32). During radiotherapy, some normal cells coming
in the field of radiation are also damaged. In general,
radiation-induced tissue injury predominantly affects
endothelial cells of small arteries and arterioles, causing
necrosis and ischaemia.
Ionising radiation causes damage to the following major
organs:
1.
Skin: radiation dermatitis, cancer.
2.
Lungs: interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.
3.
Heart: myocardial fibrosis, constrictive pericarditis.
4.
Kidney: radiation nephritis.
5.
Gastrointestinal tract: strictures of small bowel and
oesophagus.
6
Gonads: testicular atrophy in males and destruction of
ovaries.
7.
Haematopoietic tissue: pancytopenia due to bone marrow
depression.
8.
Eyes: cataract.
Besides ionising radiation, other form of harmful
radiation is solar (u.v.) radiation which may cause acute skin
injury as sunburns, chronic conditions such as solar keratosis
and early onset of cataracts in the eyes. It may, however, be
mentioned in passing here that electromagnetic radiation

243
CHAPTER 9
Environmental and Nutritional Diseases
produced by microwaves (ovens, radars, diathermy) or
ultrasound waves used for diagnostic purposes do not
produce ionisation and thus are not known to cause any
tissue injury.
NUTRITIONAL DISEASES
Nutritional status of a society varies according to the socio-
economic conditions. In the Western world, nutritional
imbalance is more often a problem accounting for increased
frequency of obesity, while in developing countries of Africa,
Asia and South America, chronic malnutrition is a serious
health problem, particularly in children.
Before describing the nutritional diseases, it is essential
to know the components of normal and adequate nutrition.
For good health, humans require energy-providing nutrients
(proteins, fats and carbohydrates), vitamins, minerals, water
and some non-essential nutrients.
1.
Energy. The requirement of energy by the body is
calculated in Kcal per day. In order to retain stable weight
and undertake day-to-day activities, the energy intake must
match the energy output. The average requirement of energy
for an individual is estimated by the formula: 900+10w for
males, and 700+7w for females (where w stands for the
weight of the individual in kilograms).  Since the requirement
of energy varies according to the level of physical activities
performed by the person, the figure arrived at by the above
formula is multiplied by: 1.2 for sedentary person, 1.4 for
moderately active person and 1.8 for very active person.
2.
Proteins. Dietary proteins provide the body with amino
acids for endogenous protein synthesis and are also a
metabolic fuel for energy (1 g of protein provides 4 Kcal).
Nine essential amino acids (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine,
methionine/cystine, phenylalanine/tyrosine, theonine,
tryptophan and valine) must be supplied by dietary intake
as these cannot be synthesised in the body. The
recommended average requirement of proteins for an adult
is 0.6 g/kg of the desired weight per day. For a healthy
person, 10-14% of caloric requirement should come from
proteins.
3.
Fats. Fats and fatty acids (in particular linolenic, linoleic
and arachidonic acid) should comprise about 35% of diet. In
order to minimise the risk of atherosclerosis, poly-
unsaturated fats should be limited to <10% of calories and
saturated fats and trans-fats should comprise <10% of calories
while monounsaturated fats to constitute the remainder of
fat intake (1 g of fat yields 9 Kcal).
4.
Carbohydrates. Dietary carbohydrates, are the major
source of dietary calories, especially  for the brain, RBCs and
muscles (1 g of carbohydrate provides 4 Kcal). At least 55%
of total caloric requirement should be derived from
carbohydrates.
5.
Vitamins. These are mainly derived from exogenous
dietary sources and are essential for maintaining the normal
structure and function of cells. A healthy individual requires
4 fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) and 11 water-soluble
vitamins (C, B1/thiamine, B2/riboflavin, B3/niacin/nicotinic
acid, B5/pantothenic acid, B6/pyridoxine, folate/folic acid,
B12/ cyanocobalamin, choline, biotin, and flavonoids).
Vitamin deficiencies result in individual deficiency
syndromes, or may be part of a multiple deficiency state.
6.
Minerals. A number of minerals like iron, calcium, phos-
phorus and certain trace elements (e.g. zinc, copper,
selenium, iodine, chlorine, sodium, potassium, magnesium,
manganese, cobalt, molybdenum etc) are essential for health.
Their deficiencies result in a variety of lesions and deficiency
syndromes.
7.
Water. Water intake is essential to cover the losses in
faeces, urine, exhalation and insensible loss so as to avoid
under- or over-hydration. Although body’s water needs
varies according to physical activities and weather
conditions, average requirement of water is 1.0-1.5 ml water/
Kcal of energy spent. Infants and pregnant women have
relatively higher requirements of water.
8. Non-essential nutrients. Dietary fibre composed of
cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin, though considered non-
essential, are important due to their beneficial effects in
lowering the risk of colonic cancer, diabetes and coronary
artery disease.
Pathogenesis of Deficiency Diseases
The nutritional deficiency disease develops when the
essential nutrients are not provided to the cells adequately.
The nutritional deficiency may be of 2 types:
1.
Primary deficiency. This is due to either the lack or
decreased amount of essential nutrients in diet.
2.
Secondary or conditioned deficiency. Secondary or
conditioned deficiency is malnutrition occurring as a result
of the various factors. These are as under:
i)
Interference with ingestion e.g. in gastrointestinal disorders
such as malabsorption syndrome, chronic alcoholism,
neuropsychiatric illness, anorexia, food allergy, pregnancy.
ii) Interference with absorption e.g. in hypermotility of the gut,
achlorhydria, biliary disease.
iii) Interference with utilisation e.g. in liver dysfunction,
malignancy, hypothyroidism.
iv) Increased excretion e.g. in lactation, perspiration, polyuria.
v) Increased nutritional demand e.g. in fever, pregnancy,
lactation, hyperthyroidism.
Irrespective of the type of nutritional deficiency (primary
or secondary), nutrient reserves in the tissues begin to get
depleted, which initially result in biochemical alterations and
eventually lead to functional and morphological changes in
tissues and organs.
In the following pages, a brief account of nutritional imba-
lance (viz. obesity) is followed by description of multiple or
mixed deficiencies (e.g. starvation, protein-energy malnutrition)
and individual nutrient deficiencies (e.g. vitamin deficiencies).
OBESITY
Dietary imbalance and overnutrition may lead to diseases
like obesity. Obesity is defined as an excess of adipose tissue that
imparts health risk; a body weight of 20% excess over ideal weight

244
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
for age, sex and height is considered a health risk. The most widely
used method to gauge obesity is body mass index (BMI)
which is equal to weight in kg/height in m2. A cut off BMI
value of 30 is used for obesity in both men and women.
ETIOLOGY. Obesity results when caloric intake exceeds utili-
sation. The imbalance of these two components can occur in
the following situations:
1.
Inadequate pushing of oneself away from the dining table
causing overeating.
2.
Insufficient pushing of oneself out of the chair leading to
inactivity and sedentary life style.
3.
Genetic predisposition to develop obesity.
4.
Diets largely derived from carbohydrates and fats than
protein-rich diet.
5.
Secondary obesity may result following a number of under-
lying diseases such as hypothyroidism, Cushing’s disease,
insulinoma and hypothalamic disorders.
PATHOGENESIS. The lipid storing cells, adipocytes
comprise the adipose tissue, and are present in vascular and
stromal compartment in the body. Besides the generally
accepted role of adipocytes for fat storage, these cells also
release endocrine-regulating molecules. These molecules
include: energy regulatory hormone (leptin), cytokines
(TNF-α and interleukin-6), insulin sensitivity regulating
agents (adiponectin, resistin and RBP4), prothrombotic
factors (plasminogen activator inhibitor), and blood pressure
regulating agent (angiotensingen).
Adipose mass is increased due to enlargement of adipose
cells due to excess of intracellular lipid deposition as well as
due to increase in the number of adipocytes. The most
important environmental factor of excess consumption of
nutrients can lead to obesity. However, underlying molecular
mechanisms of obesity are beginning to unfold based on
observations that obesity is familial and is seen in identical
twins. Recently, two obesity genes have been found: ob gene
and its protein product leptin, and db gene and its protein
product leptin receptor.
SEQUELAE OF OBESITY. Marked obesity is a serious health
hazard and may predispose to a number of clinical disorders
and pathological changes described below and illustrated in
Fig. 9.6.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Obesity is associated with
increased adipose stores in the subcutaneous tissues,
skeletal muscles, internal organs such as the kidneys,
heart, liver and omentum; fatty liver is also more common
in obese individuals. There is increase in both size and
number of adipocytes i.e. there is hypertrophy as well as
hyperplasia.
METABOLIC CHANGES. These are as under:
1.
Hyperinsulinaemia. Increased insulin secretion is a
feature of obesity. Many obese individuals exhibit hyper-
glycaemia or frank diabetes despite hyperinsulinaemia. This
is due to a state of insulin-resistance consequent to tissue
insensitivity.
2.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus. There is a strong association
of type 2 diabetes mellitus with obesity. Obesity often
exacerbates the diabetic state and in many cases weight
reduction often leads to amelioration of diabetes.
3.
Hypertension. A strong association between hyperten-
sion and obesity is observed which is perhaps due to
increased blood volume. Weight reduction leads to
significant reduction in systolic blood pressure.
4.
Hyperlipoproteinaemia. The plasma cholesterol circu-
lates in the blood as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) containing
most of the circulating triglycerides. Obesity is strongly
associated with VLDL and mildly with LDL. Total blood
cholesterol levels are also elevated in obesity.
5.
Atherosclerosis. Obesity predisposes to development of
atherosclerosis. As a result of atherosclerosis and
hypertension, there is increased risk of myocardial infarction
and stroke in obese individuals.
6.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Obesity
contributes to development of NAFLD which may progress
further to cirrhosis of the liver.
7.
Cholelithiasis. There is six times higher incidence of
gallstones in obese persons, mainly due to increased total
body cholesterol.
8.
Hypoventilation syndrome (Pickwickian syndrome).
This is characterised by hypersomnolence, both at night and
during day in obese individuals along with carbon dioxide
retention, hypoxia, polycythaemia and eventually right-sided
heart failure. (Mr Pickwick was a character, the fat boy, in
Figure 9.6
Major sequelae of obesity.

CHAPTER 9
Environmental and Nutritional Diseases
Charles Dickens’ Pickwick Papers. The term pickwickian
syndrome was first used by Sir William Osler for the sleep-
apnoea syndrome).
9.
Osteoarthritis. These individuals are more prone to
develop degenerative joint disease due to wear and tear
following trauma to joints as a result of large body weight.
10. Cancer. Diet rich in fats, particularly derived from animal
fats and meats, is associated with higher incidence of cancers
of colon, breast, endometrium and prostate.
STARVATION
Starvation is a state of overall deprivation of nutrients. Its
causes may be the following:
i)
deliberate fasting—religious or political;
ii) famine conditions in a country or community; or
iii) secondary undernutrition such as due to chronic wasting
diseases (infections, inflammatory conditions, liver disease),
cancer etc. Cancer results in malignant cachexia as a result
of which cytokines are elaborated e.g. tumour necrosis factor-
α, elastases, proteases etc.
A starved individual has lax, dry skin, wasted muscles
and atrophy of internal organs.
METABOLIC CHANGES. The following metabolic changes
take place in starvation:
1.
Glucose. Glucose stores of the body are sufficient for one
day’s metabolic needs only. During fasting state, insulin-
independent tissues such as the brain, blood cells and renal
medulla continue to utilise glucose while insulin-dependent
tissues like muscle stop taking up glucose. This results in
release of glycogen stores of the liver to maintain normal
blood glucose level. Subsequently, hepatic gluconeogenesis
from other sources such as breakdown of proteins takes place.
2.
Proteins. Protein stores and the triglycerides of adipose
tissue have enough energy for about 3 months in an
individual. Proteins breakdown to release amino acids which
are used as fuel for hepatic gluconeogenesis so as to maintain
glucose needs of the brain. This results in nitrogen imbalance
due to excretion of nitrogen compounds as urea.
3.
Fats. After about one week of starvation, protein
breakdown is decreased while triglycerides of adipose tissue
breakdown to form glycerol and fatty acids. The fatty acids
are converted into ketone bodies in the liver which are used
by most organs including brain in place of glucose. Starvation
can then continue till all the body fat stores are exhausted
following which death occurs.
PROTEIN-ENERGY MALNUTRITION
The inadequate consumption of protein and energy as a result
of primary dietary deficiency or conditioned deficiency may
cause loss of body mass and adipose tissue, resulting in
protein energy or protein calorie malnutrition (PEM or PCM).
The primary deficiency is more frequent due to
socioeconomic factors limiting the quantity and quality of
dietary intake, particularly prevalent in the developing
countries of Africa, Asia and South America. The impact of
deficiency is marked in infants and children.

of PEM includes the following (Fig. 9.7):

calorie intake may be sufficient.

lack of calories.
The salient features of the two conditions are contrasted
in Table 9.3. However, it must be remembered that mixed
forms of kwashiorkor-marasmus syndrome may also occur.
DISORDERS OF VITAMINS
Vitamins are organic substances which cannot be synthesised
within the body and are essential for maintenance of normal
structure and function of cells. Thus, these substances must be
provided in the human diet. Most of the vitamins are of plant
or animal origin so that they normally enter the body as
constituents of ingested plant food or animal food. They are
required in minute amounts in contrast to the relatively large
amounts of essential amino acids and fatty acids. Vitamins
do not play any part in production of energy.
ETIOLOGY OF VITAMIN DEFICIENCIES. In the develop-
ing countries, multiple deficiencies of vitamins and other
nutrients are common due to generalised malnutrition of
dietary origin. In the developed countries, individual vitamin
deficiencies are noted more often, particularly in children,
adolescent, pregnant and lactating women, and in some due
to poverty. General secondary causes of conditioned
nutritional deficiencies listed already above (i.e. interference
in ingestion, absorption, utilization, excretion) can result in
vitamin deficinecy in either case. Chronic alcoholism is a
common denominator in many of vitamin deficiencies. A few
other noteworthy features about vitamins are as under:
1.
While both vitamin deficiency and excess may occur from
another disease, the states of excess and deficiency
themselves also cause disease.
2.
Vitamins in high dose can be used as drugs.

CHAPTER 9
Environmental and Nutritional Diseases
Figure 9.8
Lesions resulting from vitamin A deficiency.
CLASSIFICATION OF VITAMINS. Vitamins are conven-
tionally divided into 2 groups: fat-soluble and water-soluble.
1.
Fat-soluble vitamins. There are 4 fat-soluble vitamins:
A, D, E and K. They are absorbed from intestine in the
presence of bile salts and intact pancreatic function. Their
deficiencies occur more readily due to conditioning factors
(secondary deficiency). Beside the deficiency syndromes of
these vitamins, a state of hypervitaminosis due to excess of
vitamin A and D also occurs.
2.
Water-soluble vitamins. This group conventionally
consists of vitamin C and members of B complex group.
Besides, choline, biotin and flavonoids are new additions to
this group. Water-soluble vitamins are more readily absor-
bed from small intestine. Deficiency of these vitamins is
mainly due to primary (dietary) factors. Being water soluble,
these vitamins are more easily lost due to cooking or
processing of food.
Table 9.4 sums up the various clinical disorders produced
by vitamin deficiencies.
FAT-SOLUBLE  VITAMINS
Vitamin A (Retinol)
PHYSIOLOGY. Vitamin A or retinol is a fat-soluble alcohol.
It is available in diet in 2 forms:
As preformed retinol, the dietary sources of which are
animal-derived foods such as yolk of eggs, butter, whole
milk, fish, liver, kidney.
As provitamin precursor carotenoid, which is derived from
β-carotene-containing foods such as yellow plants and
vegetables e.g. carrots, potatoes, pumpkins, mangoes,
spinach. β-carotene can be absorbed intact or converted in
the intestinal mucosa to form retinaldehyde which is
subsequently reduced to retinol.
Retinol is stored in the liver cells and released for trans-
port to peripheral tissues after binding to retinol-binding
protein found in blood.
The physiologic functions of retinol are as follows:
1.
Maintenance of normal vision in reduced light. This invol-
ves formation of 2 pigments by oxidation of retinol: rhodopsin,
a light sensitive pigment in reduced light synthesised in the
rod cells, and iodopsins sensitive in bright light and formed
in cone cells of retina. These pigments then transform the
radiant energy into nerve impulses.
2.
Maintenance of structure and function of specialised epithe-
lium. Retinol plays an important role in the synthesis of
glycoproteins of the cell membrane of specialised epithelium
such as mucus-secreting columnar epithelium in glands and
mucosal surfaces, respiratory epithelium and urothelium.
3.
Maintenance of normal cartilaginous and bone growth.
4.
Increased immunity against infections in children.
5. Anti-proliferative effect. β-carotene has anti-oxidant
properties and may cause regression of certain non-tumorous
skin diseases, premalignant conditions and certain cancers.
LESIONS IN VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY. Nutritional defi-
ciency of vitamin A is common in countries of South-East
Asia, Africa, Central and South America whereas mal-
absorption syndrome may account for conditioned vitamin
A deficiency in developed countries.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Consequent to vitamin A
deficiency, following pathologic changes are seen
(Fig. 9.8):
1.
Ocular lesions. Lesions in the eyes are most obvious.
Night blindness is usually the first sign of vitamin A
deficiency. As a result of replacement metaplasia of
mucus-secreting cells by squamous cells, there is dry and
scaly scleral conjunctiva (xerophthalmia). The lacrimal duct
also shows hyperkeratosis. Corneal ulcers may occur
which may get infected and cause keratomalacia. Bitot’s spots
may appear which are focal triangular areas of opacities
due to accumulation of keratinised epithelium. If these
occur on cornea, they impede transmission of light.
Ultimately, infection, scarring and opacities lead to
blindness.
2.
Cutaneous lesions. The skin develops papular lesions
giving toad-like appearance (xeroderma). This is due to
follicular hyperkeratosis and keratin plugging in the
sebaceous glands.
3.
Other lesions. These are as under:
i)
Squamous metaplasia of respiratory epithelium of bronchus
and trachea may predispose to respiratory infections.

248
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
ii) Squamous metaplasia of pancreatic ductal epithelium may
lead to obstruction and cystic dilatation.
iii) Squamous metaplasia of urothelium of the pelvis of kid-
ney may predispose to pyelonephritis and perhaps to
renal calculi.
iv) Long-standing metaplasia may cause progression to
anaplasia under certain circumstances.
v) Bone growth in vitamin A deficient animals is retarded.
vi) Immune dysfunction may occur due to damaged barrier
epithelium and compromised immune defenses.
vii) Pregnant women may have increased risk of maternal
infection, mortality and impaired embryonic develop-
ment.
HYPERVITAMINOSIS A. Very large doses of vitamin A
can produce toxic manifestations in children as well as in
adults. These may be acute or chronic.
Acute toxicity. This results from a single large dose of vitamin
A. The effects include neurological manifestations resembling
brain tumour e.g. headache, vomiting, stupor, papilloedema.
Chronic toxicity. The clinical manifestations of chronic
vitamin A excess are as under:
i)
Neurological such as severe headache and disordered
vision due to increased intracranial pressure.
ii) Skeletal pains due to loss of cortical bone by increased
osteoclastic activity as well as due to exostosis.
iii) Cutaneous involvement may be in the form of pruritus,
fissuring, sores at the corners of mouth and coarseness of
hair.
iv) Hepatomegaly with parenchymal damage and fibrosis.
v) Hypercarotenaemia is yellowness of palms and skin due
to excessive intake of β-carotene containing foods like carrots
or due to inborn error of metabolism.
The effects of toxicity usually disappear on stopping
excess of vitamin A intake.
Vitamin D (Calcitriol)
PHYSIOLOGY. This fat-soluble vitamin exists in 2 activated
sterol forms:
Vitamin D2 or calciferol; and
Vitamin D3 or cholecalciferol.
The material originally described as vitamin D1 was
subsequently found to be impure mixture of sterols. Since
vitamin D2 and D3 have similar metabolism and functions,
they are therefore referred to as vitamin D.
There are 2 main sources of vitamin D:
i)
Endogenous synthesis. 80% of body’s need of vitamin D
is met by endogenous synthesis from the action of ultraviolet
light on 7-dehydrocholesterol widely distributed in oily
secretions of the skin. The vitamin so formed by irradiation
enters the body directly through the skin. Pigmentation of
the skin reduces the beneficial effects of ultraviolet light.
ii) Exogenous sources. The other source of vitamin D is diet
such as deep sea fish, fish oil, eggs, butter, milk, some plants
and grains.
Irrespective of the source of vitamin D, it must be conver-
ted to its active metabolites (25-hydroxy vitamin D and 1,25-
dihydroxy vitamin D or calcitriol) after its metabolism  in
the liver and kidney for being functionally active (Fig. 9.9).
1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D (calcitriol) is 5-10 times more
potent biologically than 25-hydroxy vitamin D. The
production of calcitriol by the kidney is regulated by:
plasma levels of calcitriol (hormonal feedback);
plasma calcium levels (hypocalcaemia stimulates
synthesis); and
plasma phosphorus levels (hypophosphataemia
stimulates synthesis).
The main storage site of vitamin D is the adipose tissue
rather than the liver which is the case with vitamin A.
The main physiologic functions of the most active
metabolite of vitamin D, calcitriol, are mediated by its binding
to nuclear receptor superfamily, vitamin D receptor,
expressed on a wide variety of cells. These actions are as
under:
1.
Maintenance of normal plasma levels of calcium and
phosphorus. The major essential function of vitamin D is to
promote mineralisation of bone. This is achieved by the
following actions of vitamin D:
i)
Intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus is
stimulated by vitamin D.
ii) On bones. Vitamin D is normally required for minerali-
sation of epiphyseal cartilage and osteoid matrix. However,
in hypocalcaemia, vitamin D collaborates with parathyroid
hormone and causes osteoclastic resorption of calcium and
phosphorus from bone so as to maintain the normal blood
levels of calcium and phosphorus.
iii) On kidneys. Vitamin D stimulates reabsorption of calcium
at distal renal tubular level, though this function is also
parathyroid hormone-dependent.
2.
Antiproliferative effects. Vitamin D receptor is expressed
on the parathyroid gland cells by which active form of
vitamin D causes antiproliferative action on parathyroid cells
and suppresses the parathormone gene. Besides, vitamin D
receptor is also expressed on cells of organs which do not

CHAPTER 9
Environmental and Nutritional Diseases
have any role in mineral ion homeostasis and has
antiproliferative effects on them e.g. in skin, breast cancer
cells, prostate cancer cells.
LESIONS IN VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY.  Deficiency of
vitamin D may result from:
i)
reduced endogenous synthesis due to inadequate
exposure to sunlight;
ii) dietary deficiency of vitamin D;
iii) malabsorption of lipids due to lack of bile salts such as in
intrahepatic biliary obstruction, pancreatic insufficiency and
malabsorption syndrome;
iv) derangements of vitamin D metabolism as occur in
kidney disorders (chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome,
uraemia), liver disorders (diffuse liver disease) and genetic
disorders; and
v) resistance of end-organ to respond to vitamin D.
Deficiency of vitamin D from any of the above
mechanisms results in 3 types of lesions:
1.
rickets in growing children;
2.
osteomalacia in adults; and
3.
hypocalcaemic tetany due to neuromuscular dysfunction.
RICKETS. The primary defects in rickets are:
interference with mineralisation of bone; and
deranged endochondral and intramembranous bone
growth.
The pathogenesis of lesions in rickets is better understood
by contrasting them with sequence of changes in normal bone
growth as outlined in Table 9.5.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Rickets occurs in growing
children from 6 months to 2 years of age. The disease has
the following lesions and clinical characteristics (Fig. 9.10):
Skeletal changes. These are as under:
i) Craniotabes is the earliest bony lesion occurring due to
small round unossified areas in the membranous bones
of the skull, disappearing within 12 months of birth. The
skull looks square and box-like.
ii) Harrison’s sulcus appears due to indrawing of soft ribs
on inspiration.
iii) Rachitic rosary is a deformity of chest due to cartila-
ginous overgrowth at costochondral junction.
iv) Pigeon-chest deformity is the anterior protrusion of
sternum due to action of respiratory muscles.
v) Bow legs occur in ambulatory children due to weak
bones of lower legs.
vi) Knock knees may occur due to enlarged ends of the
femur, tibia and fibula.
vii) Lower epiphyses of radius may be enlarged.
viii) Lumbar lordosis is due to involvement of the spine
and pelvis.

Lesions in rickets.

250
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
Biochemical changes. These are as follows:
i)
Lowered levels of active metabolites of vitamin D (25-
hydroxy vitamin D and 1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D).
ii) Plasma calcium levels are normal or slightly low.
iii) Plasma phosphate levels are lowered.
iv) Plasma alkaline phosphatase is usually raised due to
osteoblastic activity.
Vitamin D-dependent rickets is an autosomal dominant
disorder of vitamin D. The disease responds rapidly to
administration of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D.
OSTEOMALACIA. Osteomalacia is the adult counterpart
of rickets in which there is failure of mineralisation of the
osteoid matrix. It may occur following dietary deficiency,
poor endogenous synthesis of vitamin D, or as a result of
conditioned deficiency.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Due to deficiency of
vitamin D, osteoid matrix laid down fails to get minera-
lised. In H and E stained microscopic sections, this is
identified by widened and thickened osteoid seams
(stained pink) and decreased mineralisation at the borders
between osteoid and bone (stained basophilic). von Kossa’s
stain for calcium may be employed to mark out the wide
seams of unstained osteoid while the calcified bone is
stained black. In addition, there may be increased
osteoclastic activity and fibrosis of marrow.
Clinical features. Osteomalacia is characterised by:
i)
muscular weakness;
ii) vague bony pains;
iii) fractures following trivial trauma;
iv) incomplete or greenstick fractures; and
v) looser’s zones or pseudofractures at weak places in bones.
Biochemical changes. These are:
i)
normal or low serum calcium levels;
ii) plasma phosphate levels lowered; and
iii) raised serum alkaline phosphatase due to increased
osteoblastic activity.
It may be worthwhile to note here that another chronic
disorder of skeleton seen in elderly, osteoporosis, is clinically
similar but biochemically different disease (Chapter 28).
HYPERVITAMINOSIS D. Very large excess of vitamin D
may cause increased intestinal absorption of calcium and
phosphorus, leading to hypercalcaemia, hyperphos-
phataemia and increased bone resorption. These changes
may result in the following effects:
i)
increased urinary excretion of calcium and phosphate;
ii) predisposition to renal calculi;
iii) osteoporosis; and
iv) widespread metastatic calcification, more marked in the
renal tubules, arteries, myocardium, lungs and stomach.
Vitamin E (ααααα-Tocopherol)
PHYSIOLOGY. Out of many naturally-occurring tocoferols
and tocotrienols, α-tocopherol is biologically the most active
fat soluble compound for humans. Vitamin E is found in most
of the ordinary foods such as vegetables, grains, nuts and
oils. It is absorbed from the intestine and transported in blood
in the form of chylomicrons. It is stored in fat depots, liver
and muscle.
The main physiologic functions of vitamin E are as
under:
1. Anti-oxidant activity. Active form of Vitamin E acts as an
antioxidant and prevents the oxidative degradation of cell
membranes containing phospholipids.
2. Scavenger of free radicals. Vitamin E scavenges free radicals
formed by redox reaction in the body (Chapter 3) and thus
maintains the integrity of the cell.
3.  Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis.
4. Activates protein kinase C and phospholipase A2.
LESIONS IN VITAMIN E DEFICIENCY. The deficiency of
vitamin E is mainly by conditioning disorders affecting its
absorption and transport such as abetalipoproteinaemia,
intra- and extrahepatic biliary cholestasis, cystic fibrosis of
the pancreas and malabsorption syndrome. Low birth weight
neonates, due to physiologic immaturity of the liver and
bowel, may also develop vitamin E deficiency. Lesions of
vitamin E deficiency are as follows:
1.
Neurons with long axons develop degeneration in the
posterior columns of spinal cord.
2.
Peripheral nerves may also develop myelin degeneration
in the axons.
3.
Skeletal muscles may develop denervation.
4.
Retinal pigmentary degeneration may occur.
5.
Red blood cells deficient in vitamin E such as in premature
infants have reduced lifespan.
6.
In experimental animals, vitamin E deficiency can pro-
duce sterility in both male and female animals.
Vitamin K
PHYSIOLOGY. Vitamin K (K for Koagulations in Danish)
exists in nature in 2 forms:
Vitamin K1 or phylloquinone, obtained from exogenous
dietary sources such as most green leafy vegetables; and
Vitamin K2 or menaquinone, produced endogenously by
normal intestinal flora. Phylloquinone can be converted into
menaquinone in some organs.
Like other fat-soluble vitamins, vitamin K is absorbed
from the small intestine and requires adequate bile flow and
intact pancreatic function.
The main physiologic function of vitamin K is in hepa-
tic microsomal carboxylation reaction for vitamin K-
dependent coagulation factors (most importantly factor II or
prothrombin; others are factors VII, IX and X).
LESIONS IN VITAMIN K DEFICIENCY. Since vitamin K
is necessary for the manufacture of prothrombin, its
deficiency leads of hypoprothrombinaemia (Chapter 13).
Estimation of plasma prothrombin, thus, affords a simple in
vitro test for determining whether there is deficiency of
vitamin K. Subjects with levels below 70% of normal should
receive therapy with vitamin K.
Because most of the green vegetables contain vitamin K
and that it can be synthesised endogenously, vitamin K
deficiency is frequently a conditioned deficiency. The
conditions which may bring about vitamin K deficiency are
as follows:

251
CHAPTER 9
Environmental and Nutritional Diseases
1.
Haemorrhagic disease of newborn. The newborn infants
are deficient in vitamin K because of minimal stores of
vitamin K at birth, lack of established intestinal flora for
endogenous synthesis and limited dietary intake since breast
milk is a poor source of vitamin K. Hence the clinical practice
is to routinely administer vitamin K at birth.
2.
Biliary obstruction. Bile is prevented from entering the
bowel due to biliary obstruction which prevents the
absorption of this fat-soluble vitamin. Surgery in patients of
obstructive jaundice, therefore, leads to marked tendency to
bleeding.
3.
Due to malabsorption syndrome. Patients suffering from
malabsorption of fat develop vitamin K deficiency e.g. coeliac
disease, sprue, pancreatic disease, hypermotility of bowel
etc.
4.
Due to anticoagulant therapy. Patients on warfarin group
of anticoagulants have impaired biosynthesis of vitamin K-
dependent coagulation factors.
5.
Due to antibiotic therapy. The use of broad-spectrum
antibiotics and sulfa drugs reduces the normal intestinal flora.
6.
Diffuse liver disease. Patients with diffuse liver disease
(e.g. cirrhosis, amyloidosis of liver, hepatocellular carcinoma,
hepatoblastoma) have hypoprothrombinaemia due to
impaired synthesis of prothrombin. Administration of
vitamin K to such patients is of no avail since liver, where
prothrombin synthesis utilising vitamin K takes place, is
diseased.
WATER-SOLUBLE  VITAMINS
Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)
PHYSIOLOGY. Vitamin C exists in natural sources as L-
ascorbic acid closely related to glucose. The major sources of
vitamin C are citrus fruits such as orange, lemon, grape fruit
and some fresh vegetables like tomatoes and potatoes. It is
present in small amounts in meat and milk. The vitamin is
easily destroyed by heating so that boiled or pasteurised milk
may lack vitamin C. It is readily absorbed from the small
intestine and is stored in many tissues, most abundantly in
adrenal cortex.
The physiologic functions of vitamin C are due to its
ability to carry out oxidation-reduction reactions:
L-Ascorbic Acid  
Dehydro L-Ascorbic
acid + 2H+ + 2e
1.
Vitamin C has been fond to have antioxidant properties
and can scavenge free radicals.
2. Ascorbic acid is required for hydroxylation of proline to
form hydroxyproline which is an essential component of
collagen.
3.
Besides collagen, it is necessary for the ground substance
of other mesenchymal structures such as osteoid, chondroitin
sulfate, dentin and cement substance of vascular
endothelium.
4.
Vitamin C being a reducing substance has other functions
such as:
hydroxylation of dopamine to norepinephrine;
maintenance of folic acid levels by preventing oxidation
of tetrahydrofolate; and
role in iron metabolism in its absorption, storage and
keeping it in reduced state.
LESIONS IN VITAMIN C DEFICIENCY. Vitamin C defi-
ciency in the food or as a conditioned deficiency results in
scurvy. The lesions and clinical manifestations of scurvy are
seen more commonly at two peak ages: in early childhood
and in the very aged. These are as under (Fig. 9.11):
1.
Haemorrhagic diathesis. A marked tendency to bleeding
is characteristic of scurvy. This may be due to deficiency of
intercellular cement which holds together the cells of
capillary endothelium. There may be haemorrhages in the
skin, mucous membranes, gums, muscles, joints and
underneath the periosteum.
2.
Skeletal lesions. These changes are more pronounced in
growing children. The most prominent change is the deranged
formation of osteoid matrix and not deranged mineralisation (c.f.
the pathological changes underlying rickets already
described). Growing tubular bones as well as flat bones are
affected. The epiphyseal ends of growing long bones have
cartilage cells in rows which normally undergo provisional
mineralisation. However, due to vitamin C deficiency, the
next step of laying down of osteoid matrix by osteoblasts is
poor and results in failure of resorption of cartilage. Conse-
quently, mineralised cartilage under the widened and irregu-
lar epiphyseal plates project as scorbutic rosary. The skeletal
changes are further worsened due to haemorrhages and
haematomas under the periosteum and bleeding into the joint
spaces.
3.
Delayed wound healing. There is delayed healing of
wounds in scurvy due to following:
deranged collagen synthesis;
Figure 9.11
Lesions in scurvy.

252
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
poor preservation and maturation of fibroblasts; and
localisation of infections in the wounds.
4.
Anaemia. Anaemia is common in scurvy. It may be the
result of haemorrhage, interference with formation of folic
acid or deranged iron metabolism. Accordingly, anaemia is
most often normocytic normochromic type; occasionally it
may be megaloblastic or even iron deficiency type.
5.
Lesions in teeth and gums. Scurvy may interfere with
development of dentin. The gums are soft and swollen, may
bleed readily and get infected commonly.
6.
Skin rash. Hyperkeratotic and follicular rash may occur
in scurvy.
VITAMIN B COMPLEX
The term vitamin B was originally coined for a substance
capable of curing beriberi (B from beriberi). Now, vitamin B
complex is commonly used for a group of essential compounds
which are biochemically unrelated but occur together in certain
foods such as green leafy vegetables, cereals, yeast, liver and
milk. Most of the vitamins in this group are involved in
metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates and fats.
The principal members of vitamin B complex are thiamine
(vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), niacin/nicotinic acid
(vitamin B3), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyridoxine
(vitamin B6), folate (folic acid), cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12)
and biotin. There is no definite evidence that any clinical
disorder results from deficiency of pantothenic acid (vitamin
B5).
Thiamine (Vitamin B1)
PHYSIOLOGY. Thiamine was the first in the family of
vitamin B complex group and hence named B1. Thiamine
hydrochloride is available in a variety of items of diet such
as peas, beans, pulses, yeast, green vegetable roots, fruits,
meat, pork, rice and wheat bran. The vitamin is lost in refined
foods such as polished rice, white flour and white sugar. A
few substances in the diet (strong tea, coffee) act as anti-
thiamines. Since the vitamin is soluble in water, considerable
amount of the vitamin is lost during cooking of vegetables.
The vitamin is absorbed from the intestine either by passive
diffusion or by energy-dependent transport. Reserves of
vitamin B1 are stored in the skeletal muscles, heart, liver,
kidneys and bones.
The main physiologic function of thiamine is in
carbohydrate metabolism. Thiamine after absorption is
phosphorylated to form thiamine pyrophosphate which is
the functionally active compound. This compound acts as
coenzyme for carboxylase so as to decarboxylate pyruvic
acid, synthesises ATP and also participates in the synthesis
of fat from carbohydrate. In addition, thiamin plays a role in
peripheral nerve conduction by an unknown mechanism.
LESIONS IN THIAMINE DEFICIENCY. Thiamine
deficiency can occur from primary or conditioned causes,
chronic alcoholism being an important cause. The deficiency
state leads to failure of complete combustion of carbohydrate
and accumulation of pyruvic acid. This results in beriberi
which produces lesions at 3 target tissues (peripheral nerves,
heart and brain). Accordingly, beriberi is of 3 types:
dry beriberi (peripheral neuritis);
wet beriberi (cardiac manifestations), and
cerebral beriberi (Wernicke-Korsakoff’s syndrome).
It is worth-noting that lesions in beriberi are mainly
located in the nervous system and heart. This is because the
energy requirement of the brain and nerves is solely derived
from oxidation of carbohydrates which is deranged in
beriberi, while lesions in the heart appear to arise due to
reduced ATP synthesis in beriberi which is required for
cardiac functions.
The features of 3 forms of beriberi are as under:
1.
Dry beriberi (peripheral neuritis). This is marked by
neuromuscular symptoms such as weakness, paraesthesia
and sensory loss. The nerves show polyneuritis, myelin
degeneration and fragmentation of axons.
2.
Wet beriberi (cardiac manifestations). This is charac-
terised by cardiovascular involvement, generalised oedema,
serous effusions and chronic passive congestion of viscera.
The heart in beriberi is flabby (due to thin and weak
myocardium), enlarged and globular in appearance due to
4-chamber dilatation (Fig. 9.12).
Microscopic examination of the heart shows hydropic
degeneration of myocardial fibres, loss of striations,
interstitial oedema and lymphocytic infiltration.
3.
Cerebral beriberi (Wernicke-Korsakoff’s syndrome).
It consists of the following features:
i)
Wernicke’s encephalopathy occurs more often due to
conditioned deficiencies such as in chronic alcoholism. It is
characterised by degeneration of ganglia cells, focal
demyelination and haemorrhage in the nuclei surrounding
the region of ventricles and aqueduct.
Microscopic examination shows degeneration and
necrosis of neurons, hypertrophy-hyperplasia of small
blood vessels and haemorrhages.
ii) Korsakoff’s psychosis results from persistence of psychotic
features following brain haemorrhage in Wernicke’s
encephalopathy.

and globular appearance of the heart due to four-chamber dilatation.

CHAPTER 9
Environmental and Nutritional Diseases
Riboflavin (Vitamin B2)
PHYSIOLOGY. Riboflavin used to be called ‘yellow
respiratory enzyme’ (flavus = yellow), now known as
‘cytochrome oxidase enzyme’ which is important in view of
its role as cellular respiratory coenzyme. The vitamin is
usually distributed in plant and animal foods such as the
liver, beaf, mutton, pork, eggs, milk and green vegetables.
Like other water-soluble vitamins, it is rapidly absorbed from
the bowel and stored in tissues like liver.
LESIONS IN RIBOFLAVIN DEFICIENCY. Lesions due to
primary or conditioned deficiency of riboflavin (aribo-
flavinosis) are as follows:
1.
Ocular lesions consist of vascularisation of normally
avascular cornea due to proliferation of capillaries from
limbus. Subsequently, conjunctivitis, interstitial keratitis and
corneal ulcers may develop.
2.
Cheilosis and angular stomatitis are characterised by
occurrence of fissures and cracks at the angles of mouth.
3.
Glossitis is development of red, cyanosed and shiny
tongue due to atrophy of mucosa of tongue (‘bald tongue’).
4
Skin changes appear in the form of scaly dermatitis
resembling seborrheic dermatitis on nasolabial folds on the
face, scrotum and vulva.
5. Anaemia may develop in some cases.
Niacin/Nicotinic Acid (Vitamin B3)
PHYSIOLOGY. As with thiamine and riboflavin, niacin or
nicotinic acid or vitamin B3 is also widely distributed in plant
and animal foods such as the liver, kidney, meat, green
vegetables and whole grain cereals. Niacin includes
biologically active derivative nicotinamide which is essential
for the formation of 2 oxidative coenzymes (dehydrogenases):
NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) which is requi-
red for dehydrogenation in the metabolism of fat, carbo-
hydrates and proteins.
NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate)
which is essential for dehydrogenation in the hexose
monophosphate shunt of glucose metabolism.
LESIONS IN NIACIN DEFICIENCY. Deficiency of niacin
causes pellagra, so named because of the rough skin of such
patients (Italian pelle agra = rough skin). Pellagra may result
from dietary deficiency in those who largely subsist on maize
since niacin in maize is present in bound form and hence not
absorbable. Since niacin can be endogenously synthesised
from tryptophan, a diet deficient in this amino acid or
disorders of tryptophan metabolism such as in carcinoid
syndrome or Hartnup syndrome results in niacin deficiency.
Lesions in pellagra are characterised by 3Ds:
1
Dermatitis: The sun-exposed areas of skin develop
erythema resembling sunburn. This may progress to chronic
type of dermatitis with blister formation.
2.
Diarrhoea: Lesions similar to those seen in skin may
develop in mucous membrane of the alimentary tract resul-
ting in glossitis, lesions in the mouth, oesophagus, stomach
and colon and cause diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and
burning sensation.
3.
Dementia: Degeneration of neurons of the brain and of
spinal tract results in neurological symptoms such as
dementia, peripheral neuritis, ataxia and visual and auditory
disturbances.
TOXICITY OF NIACIN. Toxicity due to administration of
high doses of niacin as therapy for dyslipidaemia has been
observed but not due dietary excess. It is characterised by
flushing of skin and liver derangement.
Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6)
PHYSIOLOGY. Pyridoxine or vitamin B6 is widely
distributed in all animal and plant foods such as meat, liver,
eggs, green vegetables and whole grain cereals. Pyridoxine
exists in 3 closely related naturally-occurring substances—
pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine. All of these can be
converted into biologically active coenzyme, pyridoxal 5-
phosphate.
The major physiologic functions of pyridoxine are
related to:
fat metabolism;
protein metabolism;
amino acid metabolism such as decarboxylation of amino
acids, transmethylation of methionine, conversion of trypto-
phan to niacin;
steroid metabolism;
neurotransmitter synthesis; and
haem synthesis.
LESIONS IN PYRIDOXINE DEFICIENCY. Vitamin B6
deficiency may result from inadequate dietary intake or may
result from secondary deficiency such as increased demand
in pregnancy and lactation, chronic alcoholism and intake
of certain drugs (e.g. isoniazid in the treatment of
tuberculosis, penicillamine, oestrogen in oral contraceptives
etc).
The lesions of pyridoxine deficiency include the
following:
1.
Convulsions in infants born to mothers who had been
administered large doses of vitamin B6 for hyperemesis
gravidarum (pyridoxine dependence)
2.
Dermatitis and seborrhoea
3.
Cheilosis and angular stomatitis
4.
Glossitis (bald tongue)
5.
Neuropathy
6.
Depression, confusion
7.
Sideroblastic anaemia.
Folate (Folic Acid) and Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12)
Both these vitamins included in the B complex group are
required for red cell formation. Their deficiency leads to
megaloblastic anaemia which is discussed in Chapter 12.
Biotin
PHYSIOLOGY. Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin and a
member of vitamin B complex group. It is available in food
sources such as organ meat, soya beans, egg yolk; however

254
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
egg-white has a protein avidin which binds to biotin and
blocks its bioavailability.
The major physiologic functions of biotin are as under:
1.
In gene expression
2.
In gluconeogenesis
3.
In fatty acid synthesis
4.
In catabolism of certain amino acids such as leucine
4.
As carrier of CO2 in carboxylase enzymes.
LESIONS IN BIOTIN DEFICIENCY. Biotin deficiency is
rare and develops due to inborn errors of metabolism and in
patients on parenteral nutrients devoid of biotin. The lesions
of biotin deficiency are as under:
1.
Mental and neurologic symptoms such as hallucination,
depression, paraesthesia
2.
Anorexia
3.
Nausea
4.
Scaly, seborrhoeic dermatitis
5.
In infants, hypotonia, alopecia and rash near ears.
In concluding the discussion of vitamin B complex, it
must be mentioned that many of the animal and plant foods
contain vitamin B complex group of vitamins. Their
deficiency, whether primary from poverty, ignorance etc, or
secondary from conditioning factors like chronic alcoholism,
is more frequently multiple vitamin deficiency. Hence, the
clinical practice is to administer combination of these
members of vitamin B complex.
CHOLINE
PHYSIOLOGY. Choline is precursor form of acetylcoline and
betaine. Choline is widely distributed as lecithin in foods such
as egg yolk, milk, wheat and organ meat.  Choline is also
synthesised in the liver.
The major physiologic functions of choline are as under:
1.
In maintenance structural integrity of cell membranes
2.
In transmembrane signaling pathways
3.
In cholinergic neurotransmission
4.
In metabolism of lipids and cholesterol.
LESIONS IN CHOLINE DEFICIENCY. Choline deficiency
develops in patients on choline-free parenteral nutrients. The
lesions of choline deficiency are as under:
1.
Fatty liver with deranged liver enzymes
2.
Skeletal muscle damage with elevated CPK levels.
FLAVONOIDS
PHYSIOLOGY. Flavoonoids are a form of polyphenols
present in several fruits and vegetables and are the
constituents which imparts colour, flavour and taste to these
edible products. Particular food and vegetables rich in
flavonoids are berries, grapes, apples, broccoli, onions,
legumes etc.
The major physiologic functions of flavonoids are as
under:
1.
As antioxidants
2.
In cell signaling pathways
LESIONS IN BIOTIN DEFICIENCY. Flavonoids have been
a recent addition to the family of vitamins. Present data on
animal experiments and human clinical studies indicates that
they play a role in prevention of neurodegenerative diseases,
osteoporosis and diabetes.
METALS AND TRACE ELEMENTS
Several minerals in trace amounts are essential for health
since they form components of enzymes and cofactors for
metabolic functions. Besides calcium and phosphorus required
for vitamin D manufacture, others include: iron, copper, iodine,
zinc, selenium, manganese, nickel, chromium, molybdenum,
fluorine. However, out of these, the dietary deficiency of first
five trace elements is associated with deficiency states which
are discussed in detail in respective chapters later. These are
as under:
i)
Iron: Microcytic hypochromic anaemia.
ii) Calcium: reduced bone mass, osteoporosis.
iii) Phosphorous: Rickets, osteomalacia.
iv) Copper: Muscle weakness, neurologic defect, anaemia,
growth retardation.
v) Iodine: Goitre and hyperthyroidism, cretinism.
vi) Zinc: Growth retardation, infertility, alopecia.
vii) Selenium: Cardiomyopathy, muscle degeneration.
viii) Fluoride: Dental caries.
ix) Manganese: Impaired growth and skeletal development.
x) Molybdenum: Severe neurological abnormalities.
DIET AND CANCER
Before closing the discussion of nutritional pathology, it is
worthwhile to sum up relationship of these factors to
carcinogenesis discussed in previoius chapter. There are three
possible mechanisms on which the story of this relationship
can be built up:
1.
Dietary content of exogenous carcinogens:
i)
The most important example in this mechanism comes
from naturally-occurring carcinogen aflatoxin which is
strongly associated with high incidence of hepatocellular
carcinoma in those consuming grain contaminated with
mould, Aspergillus flavus.
ii) Artificial sweeteners (e.g. saccharine cyclomates), food
additives and pesticide contamination of food are implicated
as carcinogens derived from diet.
2.
Endogenous synthesis of carcinogens or promoters:
i)
In the context of etiology of gastric carcinoma, nitrites,
nitrates and amines from the digested food are trans-
formed in the body to carcinogens—nitrosamines and
nitrosamides.
ii) In the etiology of colon cancer, low fibre intake and high
animal-derived fats are implicated. High fat diet results in
rise in the level of bile acids and their intermediate
metabolites produced by intestinal bacteria which act as

255
CHAPTER 9
Environmental and Nutritional Diseases
carcinogens. The low fibre diet, on the other hand, does not
provide adequate protection to the mucosa and reduces the
stool bulk and thus increases the time the stools remain in
the colon.
iii) In the etiology of breast cancer, epidemiologic studies have
implicated the role of animal proteins, fats and obesity with
as yet unsubstantiated evidence.
3.
Inadequate protective factors:
As already mentioned, some components of diet such as
vitamin C, A, E, selenium, and β-carotenes have protective role
against cancer. These substances in normal amounts in the
body act as antioxidants and protect the cells against free
radical injury but their role of supplementation in diet as
prevention against cancer is unproven.

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
This chapter deals with the group of disorders affecting the
foetus during intrauterine life (genetic as well as
developmental) and paediatric age group. In the western
countries, developmental and genetic birth defects constitute
about 50% of total mortality in infancy and childhood, while
in the developing and underdeveloped countries 95% of
infant mortality is attributed to environmental factors such
as poor sanitation and undernutrition.
For the purpose of convenience of discussion, genetic and
paediatric diseases are covered under the following headings:
1
Developmental defects: Errors in morphogenesis
2.
Cytogenetic (Karyotypic) defects: chromosomal abnor-
malities
3.
Single-gene defects: Mendelian disorders
4.
Multifactorial inheritance disorders
5.
Other paediatric diseases
Though many of diseases included in the groups above
have been discussed along with relevant chapters later, broad
overview of these disorders is presented below.
DEVELOPMENTAL DEFECTS
Developmental defects are a group of abnormalities during
foetal life due to errors in morphogenesis. The branch of
science dealing with the study of developmental anomalies
is called teratology. Certain chemicals, drugs, physical and
biologic agents are known to induce such birth defects and
are called teratogens. The morphologic abnormality or defect
in an organ or anatomic region of the body so produced is
called malformation.
Pathogenesis
The teratogens may result in one of the following outcomes:
i)
Intrauterine death
ii) Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR)
iii) Functional defects
iv) Malformation
The effects of teratogens in inducing developmental
defects are related to the following factors:
Variable individual susceptibility to teratogen: All patients
exposed to the same teratogen do not develop birth defect.
Intrauterine stage at which patient is exposed to teratogen:
Most teratogens induce birth defects during the first trimester
of pregnancy.
Dose of teratogen: Higher the exposure dose of teratogen,
greater the chances of inducing birth defects.
Specificity of developmental defect for specific teratogen: A
particular teratogen acts in a particular way and induces the
same specific developmental defect.
Chapter 10
Genetic and
Paediatric Diseases
Chapter 10
Classification
Various developmental anomalies resulting from teratogenic
effects are categorised as under:
Agenesis means the complete absence of an organ e.g.
unilateral or bilateral agenesis of kidney.
Aplasia is the absence of development of an organ with
presence of rudiment or anlage e.g. aplasia of lung with
rudimentary bronchus.
Hypoplasia is incomplete development of an organ not
reaching the normal adult size e.g. microglossia.
Atresia refers to incomplete formation of lumen in hollow
viscus e.g. oesophageal atresia.
Developmental dysplasia is defective development of cells
and tissues resulting in abnormal or primitive histogenetic
structures e.g. renal dysplasia (Developmental dysplasia is quite
different from cellular dysplasia in relation to precancerous
lesions discussed earlier on page 58).
Dystraphic anomalies are the defects resulting from failure
of fusion e.g. spina bifida.
Ectopia or heterotopia refers to abnormal location of tissue
at ectopic site e.g. pancreatic heterotopia in the wall of
stomach.
Examples of Developmental Defects
A few common clinically important examples are given
below:
1.
Anencephaly-spina bifida complex. This is the group of
anomalies resulting from failure to fuse (dystraphy). While
anencephaly results from failure of neural tube closure, spina
bifida occurs from incomplete closure of the spinal cord and
vertebral column, often in the lumbar region. The latter
results in meningocele or meningomyelocele.
2.
Thalidomide malformations. Thalidomide is the best
known example of teratogenic drug which was used as a
sedative by pregnant women in 1960s in England and
Germany and resulted in high incidence of limb-reduction
anomalies (phocomelia) in the newborns.
3.
Foetal hydantoin syndrome. Babies born to mothers on
anti-epileptic treatment with hydantoin have characteristic
facial features and congenital heart defects.
4.
Foetal alcohol syndrome. Ethanol is another potent
teratogen. Consumption of alcohol by pregnant mother in
first trimester increases the risk of miscarriages, stillbirths,
growth retardation and mental retardation in the newborn.
5.
TORCH complex. Infection with TORCH group of
organisms (Toxoplasma, Others, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus,

257
CHAPTER 10
Genetic and Paediatric Diseases
and Herpes simplex) during pregnancy is associated with
multisystem anomalies and TORCH syndrome in the
newborn (page 191).
6.
Congenital syphilis. As discussed in Chapter 6, vertical
transmission of syphilis from mother to foetus is
characterised by Hutchinson’s triad: interstitial keratitis,
sensorineural deafness and deformed Hutchinson’s teeth,
along with saddle-nose deformity.
CYTOGENETIC (KARYOTYPIC)
ABNORMALITIES
Human germ cells (ova and sperms) contain 23 chromo-
somes (haploid or 1N) while all the nucleated somatic cells
of the human body contain 23 pairs of chromosomes
(diploid or 2N)—44 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes,
being XX in females (46, XX) and XY in males (46, XY). The
branch of science dealing with the study of human
chromosomal abnormalities is called cytogenetics
(discussed in Chapter 2).
In a female, one of the two X chromosomes (paternal or
maternal derived) is inactivated during embryogenesis as
stated in Lyon hypothesis. This inactivation is passed to all
the somatic cells while the germ cells in the female remain
unaffected i.e. ovary will always have active X chromosome.
Such an inactive X chromosome in the somatic cells in females
lies condensed in the nucleus and is called as sex chromatin
seen specifically in the somatic cells in females. Nuclear sexing
can be done for genetic female testing by preparing and
staining the smears of squamous cells scraped from oral
cavity, or by identifying the Barr body in the circulating
neutrophils as drumstick appendage attached to one of the
nuclear lobes (Fig. 10.1). A minimum of 30% cells positive
for sex chromatin is indicative of genetically female
composition.
Though chromosomes can be studied in any human
nucleated cells, circulating lymphocytes are more often used
for this purpose. The study is done by arresting the dividing
cells in metaphase by colchicine and then spreading them
on glass slide and staining them with Giemsa stain.
Karyotype is the photographic representation of the
stained preparation of chromosomes.
Each chromosome is composed of a pair of identical
double helix of chromosomal DNA called chromatids. The
chromosomes are classified based on their length and location
of the centromere; centromere is the point where the two
chromatids cross each other (Fig. 10.2). The distal end of each
chromosome is called telomere.
Based on centromeric location, they are classified into 3
groups:
Metacentric chromosomes (numbers 1, 3, 16, 19, 20) are those
in which the centromere is exactly in the middle.
Submetacentric chromosomes (numbers 1, 3) in which the
centromere divides the chromosomes into short arm (p arm;
petit means short in French) and long arm (q arm; for alphabet
next to p).
Acrocentric chromosomes (numbers 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, and
Y) have very short arm and the centromere is eccentrically
located.
Based on length of chromosomes, they are divided into 7
groups—A to G, called Denver classification adopted at a
meeting in Denver, Colorado in US.
Chromosomal banding techniques are employed for study
of classes of chromosomes. Chromosomal bands are unique
alternate dark and light staining patterns. Banding techniques
include:
i)
G-banding (Giemsa stain);
ii) Q-banding (quinacrine fluorescence stain);
iii) R-banding (reverse Giemsa staining); and
iv) C-banding (constitutive heterochromatin demonstration).
With these brief introductory comments, we can now turn
to abnormalities of chromosomes which can be divided into
2 types:
1.
Numerical abnormalities; and
2.
Structural abnormalities.
Numerical Abnormalities
As mentioned above, normal karyotype of a human
nucleated somatic cell is diploid or 2N (46 chromosomes)

squamous cells from oral cavity. B, Barr body seen as drumstick
appendage attached to a lobe of a circulating neutrophil.

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
while the germ cells have haploid or 1N (23 chromo-
somes).
1.
Polyploidy is the term used for the number of chromo-
somes which is a multiple of haploid number e.g. triploid or
3N (69 chromosomes), tetraploid or 4N (92 chromosomes).
Polyploidy occurs normally in megakaryocytes and dividing
liver cells. Polyploidy in somatic cells of conceptus results
in spontaneous abortions.
2.
Aneuploidy is the number of chromosomes which is not
an exact multiple of haploid number e.g. hypodiploid or
2N-1 (45 chromosomes) monosomy, hyperdiploid or 2 N+1
(47 chromosomes) trisomy.
The most common mechanism of aneuploidy is
nondisjunction. Nondisjunction is the failure of chromo-
somes to separate normally during cell division during first
or second stage of meiosis, or in mitosis.
Nondisjunction during first meiotic division stage will result
in two gametes from both the parental chromosomes due to
failure to separate while the other two gametes will have no
chromosomes (nullisomic).
Nondisjunction during second meiotic division stage results
in one gamete with two identical copies of the same
chromosome, one nullisomic gamete, and two gametes with
normal chromosome number.
Nondisjunction during mitosis results in mosaicism,
meaning thereby that the individual has two or more types
of cell lines derived from the same zygote. Mosaicism of
mitotic nondisjunction of chromosomes occurs in cancers.
Anaphase lag is a form of nondisjunction involving single
pair of chromosomes in which one chromosome in meiosis
or a chromatid in mitosis fails to reach the pole of dividing
cell at the same time (i.e. it lags behind) and is left out of the
nucleus of daughter cell. This results in one normal daughter
cell and the other monosomic for the missing chromosome.
Three clinically important syndromes resulting from
numerical aberrations of chromosomes due to nondisjunction
are as under and their main clinical features are illustrated
in Fig. 10.3:
Down’s syndrome. There is trisomy 21 in about 95% cases
of Down’s syndrome due to nondisjunction during meiosis
in one of the parents. Down’s syndrome is the most common
chromosomal disorder and is the commonest cause of mental
retardation. The incidence of producing offspring with
Down’s syndrome rises in mothers over 35 years of age.
Klinefelter’s syndrome. Klinefelter’s syndrome is the
most important example of sex chromosome trisomy. About
80% cases have 47, XXY karyotype while others are mosaics.
Typically, these patients have testicular dysgenesis. In
general, sex chromosome trisomies are more common than
trisomies of autosomes.
Turner’s syndrome. Turner’s syndrome is an example
of monosomy (45, X0) most often due to loss of X
chromosome in paternal meiosis.
Structural Abnormalities
During cell division (meiosis as well as mitosis), certain
structural abnormalities of chromosomes may appear. These
may occur during gametogenesis and then transmitted to
all somatic cells and cause hereditary transmissible disorders,
or may produce somatic cell mutations and result in changes
varying from no effect to some forms of cancers. Structural
abnormalities may be balanced or unbalanced.
Balanced structural alteration means no change in total
number of genes or genetic material.
Unbalanced structural alteration refers to gene rearrange-
ment resulting in loss or gain of genetic material.
Some common forms of structural abnormalities are as
under (Fig. 10.4):

CHAPTER 10
Genetic and Paediatric Diseases
TRANSLOCATIONS. Translocation means crossing over or
exchange of fragment of chromosome which may occur
between non-homologous or homologous chromosomes.
There are two main types of translocations: reciprocal in
about two-third and Robertsonian in one-third cases:
Reciprocal translocation is the exchange of genetic
material between two non-homologous (heterologous)
chromosomes without involving centromere (acentric). Such
translocations occur due to single breaks in both the
chromosomes and the exchange is detected by banding
techniques. Reciprocal translocation may be balanced
(without any loss of genetic material during the exchange)
or unbalanced (with some loss of genetic material).
i)
Balanced reciprocal translocation is more common and the
individual is phenotypically normal e.g. translocation
between long arm (q) of chromosomes 22 and long arm (q)
of chromosome 9 written as 46, XX, t (9;22). This translocation
is termed Philadelphia chromosome seen in most cases of
chronic myeloid leukaemia (page 355).
ii) Unbalanced reciprocal translocations are less common and
account for repeated abortions and malformed children.
Robertsonian translocation is less common than reci-
procal translocation. In this, there is fusion of two acrocentric
chromosomes (having very short arms) at the centromere
(centric fusion) with loss of short arms. The result of this
fusion is one very large chromosome and the other very small
one. Individuals born with Robertsonian translocation may
be phenotypically normal but suffer from infertility and are
at higher risk of producing malformed children in the next
progeny.
DELETIONS. Loss of genetic material from the chromosome
is called deletion. Deletion may be from the terminal or
middle portion of the chromosome. The examples of deletion
are: cri du chat (named after cry of infant like that of a cat)
syndrome (deletion of short arm of chromosome 5) and
several cancers with hereditary basis (e.g. retinoblastoma
with deletion of long arm of chromosome 13, Wilms’ tumour
with deletion of short arm of chromosome 11).
INVERSION. Inversion is a form of rearrangement invol-
ving breaks of a single chromosome at two points. Inversion
may be pericentric or paracentric, depending upon whether
the rotation occurs at the centromere or at the acentric portion
of the arm of chromosome. Inversions are not associated with
any abnormality.
RING CHROMOSOME. A ring of chromosome is formed
by a break at both the telomeric (terminal) ends of a
chromosome followed by deletion of the broken fragment
and then end-to-end fusion. The consequences of ring
chromosome depend upon the amount of genetic material
lost due to break.
ISOCHROMOSOME. When centromere, rather than divi-
ding parallel to the long axis, instead divides transverse to
the long axis of chromosome, it results in either two short
arms only or two long arms only called isochromosomes.
The example involving isochromosome of X-chromosome is
seen in some cases (15%) of Turner’s syndrome.
SINGLE-GENE DEFECTS
(MENDELIAN DISORDERS)
In order to unravel causes of disease at genetic level,
spectacular advances have been made in human genetics.
With mapping of human genome consisting of about 30,000
genes, it is possible to perform molecular profiling of diseases
at genetic level.
The classic laws of inheritance of characteristics or traits
were outlined by Austrian monk Gregor Mendel in 1866
based on his observations of cross-breeding of red and white
garden peas. Single-gene defects follow the classic mendelian
patterns of inheritance and are also called mendelian
disorders. These disorders are the result of mutation of a
single gene of large effect.
MUTATIONS. The term mutation is applied to permanent
change in the DNA of the cell. Mutations affecting germ cells
are transmitted to the next progeny producing inherited
diseases, while the mutations affecting somatic cells give rise
to various cancers and congenital malformations. Presently,
following types of mutations have been described:
i)
Point mutation is the result of substitution of a single
nucleotide base by a different base i.e. replacement of an
amino acid by another e.g. in sickle cell anaemia there is point
mutation by substitution of glutamic acid by valine in the
polypeptide chain.
ii) Stop codon or nonsense mutation refers to a type of point
mutation in which the protein chain is prematurely
terminated or truncated.
Figure 10.4
Common structural abnormalities of human chromosomes.

260
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
iii) Frameshift mutation occurs when there is insertion or
deletion of one or two base pairs in the DNA sequence e.g.
in cystic fibrosis of pancreas.
iv) Trinucleotide repeat mutation is characterised by
amplification of a sequence of three nucleotides.
Thus it can be summed up from above that single-gene
defects are synonymous with various types of heritable
mutations. Currently, approximately 5000 single-gene defects
have been described—some major and others of minor
consequence. While most of these disorders are discussed in
relevant chapters later, the group of storage diseases (inborn
errors of metabolism) is considered below.
INHERITANCE PATTERN. The inheritance pattern of
genetic abnormalities may be dominant or recessive, autosomal
or sex-linked:
A dominant gene* produces its effects, whether combined
with similar dominant or recessive gene.  Recessive genes are
effective only if both genes are similar. However, when both
alleles of a gene pair are expressed in heterozygous state, it
is called codominant inheritance. A single gene may express
in multiple allelic forms known as polymorphism.
Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern is characterised by
one faulty copy of gene (i.e. mutant allele) in any autosome
and one copy of normal allele; disease phenotype is seen in
all such individuals. Patients having autosomal dominant
inheritance disease have 50% chance of passing on the disease
to the next generation.
In autosomal recessive inheritance, both copies of genes are
mutated. Usually, it occurs when both parents are carriers
of the defective gene, i.e. having one normal allele and one
defective allele in each parent, and each parent passes on
their defective gene to the next progeny causing disease.
There is 25% chance of transmission of autosomal recessive
disease when both parents are carriers.
X-linked disorders are caused by mutations in genes on X-
chromosome, derived from either one of the two X-
chromosomes in females, or from the single X-chromosome
of the male. There are much fewer genes on Y-chromosome
and are determinant for testis; they are not known to cause
any sex-linked disorder. Therefore, all sex-linked disorders
are, in fact, X-linked disorders.
Table 10.1 lists important examples of groups of genetic
disorders: autosomal recessive (the largest group), codominant
(intermediate), and dominant, and sex-(X-) linked recessive
and dominant disorders.
STORAGE DISEASES
(INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM)
Storage diseases or inborn errors of metabolism are bio-
chemically distinct groups of disorders occurring due to
genetic defect in the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and
proteins resulting in intracellular accumulation of
metabolites. These substances may collect within the cells
throughout the body but most commonly affected organ or
site is the one where the stored material is normally found
and degraded. Since lysosomes comprise the chief site of
intracellular digestion (autophagy as well as heterophagy),
the material is naturally stored in the lysosomes, and hence
the generic name ‘lysosomal storage diseases’. Cells of mono-
nuclear-phagocyte system are particularly rich in lysosomes;
therefore, reticuloendothelial organs containing numerous
phagocytic cells like the liver and spleen are most commonly
involved in storage disease.
Based on the biochemical composition of the accumulated
material within the cells, storage diseases are classified into
distinct groups, each group containing a number of diseases
depending upon the specific enzyme deficiency. A summary
*A particular characteristic of an individual is determined by a pair of
single genes, located at the same specific site termed locus, on a pair of
homologous chromosomes. These paired genes are called alleles which
may be homozygous when alike, and heterozygous if dissimilar. Genotype
is the genetic composition of an individual while phenotype is the effect
of genes produced.

Genetic and Paediatric Diseases
of major groups of storage diseases along with their
respective enzyme deficiencies, major accumulating
metabolites and the organs involved is presented in
Table 10.2. A few general comments can be made about all
storage diseases:
All the storage diseases occur either as a result of auto-
somal recessive, or sex-(X-) linked recessive genetic
transmission.
Most, but not all, of the storage diseases are lysosomal
storage diseases. Out of the glycogen storage diseases, only
type II (Pompe’s disease) is due to lysosomal enzyme
deficiency.
A few important forms of storage diseases are described
below:
Glycogen Storage Diseases (Glycogenoses)
These are a group of inherited disorders in which there is
defective glucose metabolism resulting in excessive intra-
cellular accumulation of glycogen in various tissues. Based
on specific enzyme deficiencies, glycogen storage diseases
are divided into 8 main types designated by Roman numerals
I to VIII. However, based on pathophysiology, glycogen
storage diseases can be divided into 3 main subgroups:
1.
Hepatic forms are characterised by inherited deficiency
of hepatic enzymes required for synthesis of glycogen for
storage (e.g. von Gierke’s disease or type I glycogenosis) or
due to lack of hepatic enzymes necessary for breakdown of
glycogen into glucose (e.g. type VI glycogenosis).
2.
Myopathic forms on the other hand, are those disorders
in which there is genetic deficiency of glycolysis to form
lactate in the striated muscle resulting in accumulation of
glycogen in the muscles (e.g. McArdle’s disease or type V
glycogenosis, type VII disease).
3.
Other forms are those in which glycogen storage does
not occur by either hepatic or myopathic mechanisms. In
Pompe’s disease or type II glycogenosis, there is lysosomal
storage of glycogen, while in type IV there is deposition of
abnormal metabolites of glycogen in the brain, heart, liver
and muscles.
The prototypes of these three forms are briefly considered
below.
VON GIERKE’S DISEASE (TYPE I GLYCOGENOSIS).
This condition is inherited as an autosomal recessive
disorder due to deficiency of enzyme, glucose-6-phos-
phatase. In the absence of glucose-6-phosphatase, excess
of normal type of glycogen accumulates in the liver and
also results in hypoglycaemia due to reduced formation
of free glucose from glycogen. As a result, fat is meta-
bolised for energy requirement leading to hyper-
lipoproteinaemia and ketosis. Other changes due to

General Pathology and Basic Techniques
deranged glucose metabolism are hyperuricaemia and
accumulation of pyruvate and lactate.
The disease manifests clinically in infancy with failure to
thrive and stunted growth. Most prominent feature is
enormous hepatomegaly with intracytoplasmic and
intranuclear glycogen. The kidneys are also enlarged and
show intracytoplasmic glycogen in tubular epithelial cells.
Other features include gout, skin xanthomas and bleeding
tendencies due to platelet dysfunction.
POMPE’S DISEASE (TYPE II GLYCOGENOSIS). This is
also an autosomal recessive disorder due to deficiency of a
lysosomal enzyme, acid maltase, and is the only example of
lysosomal storage disease amongst the various types of
glycogenoses. Acid maltase is normally present in most cell
types and is responsible for the degradation of glycogen. Its
deficiency, therefore, results in accumulation of glycogen in
many tissues, most often in the heart and skeletal muscle,
leading to cardiomegaly and hypotonia.
McARDLE’S DISEASE (TYPE V GLYCOGENOSIS). The
condition occurs due to deficiency of muscle phosphorylase
resulting in accumulation of glycogen in the muscle
(deficiency of liver phosphorylase results in type VI
glycogenosis). The disease is common in 2nd to 4th decades
of life and is characterised by painful muscle cramps,
especially after exercise, and detection of myoglobinuria in
half the cases.
Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS)
Mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of six inherited
syndromes numbered from MPS I to MPS VI. Each of these
results from deficiency of specific lysosomal enzyme
involved in the degradation of mucopolysaccharides or
glycosaminoglycans, and are, therefore, a form of lysosomal
storage diseases. Mucopolysaccharides which accumulate in
the MPS are: chondroitin sulphate, dermatan sulphate,
heparan sulphate and keratan sulphate. All these syndromes
are autosomal recessive disorders except MPS II (Hunter’s
syndrome) which has X-linked recessive transmission.
Syndrome of MPS manifests in infancy or early childhood
and involves multiple organs and tissues, chiefly connective
tissues, liver, spleen, bone marrow, lymph nodes, kidneys,
heart and brain. The mucopolysaccharides accumulate in
mononuclear phagocytic cells, endothelial cells, intimal
smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. The material is finely
granular and PAS-positive by light microscopy. By electron
microscopy, it appears in the swollen lysosomes and can be
identified biochemically as mucopolysaccharide.
Gaucher’s Disease
This is an autosomal recessive disorder in which there is
mutation in lysosomal enzyme,  acid β-glucosidase (earlier
called glucocerebrosidase), which normally cleaves glucose
from ceramide. This results in lysosomal accumulation of
glucocerebroside (ceramide-glucose) in phagocytic cells of
the body and sometimes in the neurons. The main sources
of glucocerebroside in phagocytic cells are the membrane
glycolipids of old leucocytes and erythrocytes, while the
deposits in the neurons consist of gangliosides.
Clinically, 3 subtypes of Gaucher’s disease are identified
based on neuronopathic involvement:
Type I or classic form is the adult form of disease in which
there is storage of glucocerebrosides in the phagocytic cells
of the body, principally involving the spleen, liver, bone
marrow, and lymph nodes. This is the most common type
comprising 80% of all cases of Gaucher’s disease.
Type II is the infantile form in which there is progressive
involvement of the central nervous system.
Type III is the juvenile form of the disease having features
in between type I and type II i.e. they have systemic
involvement like in type I and progressive involvement of
the CNS as in type II.
The clinical features depend upon the clinical subtype of
Gaucher’s disease. In addition to involvement of different
organs and systems (splenomegaly, hepatomegaly,
lymphadenopathy, bone marrow and cerebral involvement),
a few other features include pancytopenia, or thrombo-
cytopenia secondary to hypersplenism, bone pains and
pathologic fractures.
Microscopy shows large number of characteristically
distended and enlarged macrophages called Gaucher cells
which are found in the spleen, liver, bone marrow and
lymph nodes, and in the case of neuronal involvement, in
the Virchow-Robin space. The cytoplasm of these cells is
abundant, granular and fibrillar resembling crumpled
tissue paper. They have mostly a single nucleus but
occasionally may have two or three nuclei (Fig. 10.5, A,
C). Gaucher cells are positive with PAS, oil red O, and
Prussian-blue reaction indicating the nature of
accumulated material as glycolipids admixed with
haemosiderin. These cells often show erythrophagocytosis
and are rich in acid phosphatase.
Niemann-Pick Disease
This is also an autosomal recessive disorder characterised
by accumulation of sphingomyelin and cholesterol due to
defect in acid sphingomyelinase.
Two types have been described: type A and B.
Type A is more common and typically presents in infancy
and is characterised by hepatosplenomegaly, lymph-
adenopathy, rapidly progressive deterioration of CNS and
physical underdevelopment. About a quarter of patients
present with familial amaurotic idiocy with characteristic
cherry-red spots in the macula of the retina (amaurosis = loss
of vision without apparent lesion of the eye).
Type B develops later and has a progressive hepato-
splenomegaly with development of cirrhosis due to
replacement of the liver by foam cells, and impaired lung
function due to infiltration in lung alveoli.
Microscopy shows storage of sphingomyelin and choles-
terol within the lysosomes, particularly in the cells of
mononuclear phagocyte system. The cells of Niemann-
Pick disease are somewhat smaller than Gaucher cells
and their cytoplasm is not wrinkled but is instead foamy

and vacuolated which stains positively with fat stains
(Fig. 10.5, B). These cells are widely distributed in the
spleen, liver, lymph nodes, bone marrow, lungs, bowel
and brain.
MULTIFACTORIAL  INHERITANCE
Some normal phenotypic characteristics have also
multifactorial inheritance e.g. colour of hair, eye, skin, height
and intelligence. Multifactorial disorders are those disorders
which result from the combined effect of genetic composition
and environmental influences. Some common examples of
such disorders in which environmental influences mask the
mutant genes are as under:
1.
Cleft lip and cleft palate
2.
Pyloric stenosis
3.
Diabetes mellitus
4.
Hypertension
5.
Congenital heart disease
6.
Coronary heart disease.
OTHER PAEDIATRIC DISEASES
As mentioned in the foregoing discussion, many diseases
affecting infancy and childhood are genetic or developmental
in origin. Here, other diseases affecting the period from birth
to puberty are discussed under the heading of paediatric
diseases. This period is conventionally subdivided into 4
stages:
Neonatal period: birth to first 4 weeks
Infancy: first year of life
Early childhood: 1-4 years
Late childhood: 5-14 years
Each of these four stages has distinct anatomic,
physiologic and immunologic development compared to
adults and, therefore, has different groups of diseases unique
to particular age groups. Before discussing these diseases
affecting different age groups, a few general comments about
these stages can be made:
1.
Neonatal period is the period of continuation of
dependent intrauterine foetal life to independent postnatal
period. Therefore, this is the period of maximum risk to life
due to perinatal causes (e.g. prematurity, low birth weight,
perinatal infections, respiratory distress syndrome, birth
asphyxia, birth trauma etc) and congenital anomalies. If
adequate postnatal medical care is not provided, neonatal
mortality is high. Neonatal mortality in first week after birth
is about 10-times higher compared to second week, and
shows improvement with every passing week at this stage.
2.
In infancy, the major health problems are related to
congenital anomalies, infections of lungs and bowel, and
sudden infant death syndrome (often during sleep).
3.
Young children from 1-4 years are exposed to higher risk
of sustaining injuries, and manifest certain congenital
anomalies. Some malignant tumours are peculiar to this age
group.
4.
Older children from 5-14 years too have higher risk of
injuries from accidents and have other problems related to
congenital anomalies and certain malignant tumours at this
age.
Thus, hazardous effects of congenital anomalies are a
common denominator for all age groups from birth to
adolescence. Specific tumours peculiar to infants and
children are discussed along with discussion in related
chapters of Systemic Pathology. However, a short note on
general aspects of this subject is given below.
TUMOURS OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD
Tumours of infancy and childhood comprise 2% of all
malignant tumours but they are the leading cause of death
in this age group exceeded only by accidents. Benign tumours
are more common than malignant neoplasms but they are
generally of little immediate consequence. Another aspect
requiring consideration here is the difficulty in differentiating
benign tumours from tumour-like lesions.
HISTOGENESIS. Histogenetic evolution of tumours at
different age groups takes place as under:
Figure 10.5
Diagrammatic view of comparative features of typical
Gaucher cell (A). B, typical macrophage in Niemann-Pick disease. C, A
Gaucher cell (arrow) in bone marrow aspirate smear.

264
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
Some tumours have probably evolved in utero and are
apparent at birth or in immediate postnatal period. Such
tumours are termed developmental tumours.
Many other tumours originate in abnormally developed
organs and organ rests; they become apparent subsequently
and are termed embryonic tumours.
In embryonic tumours, proliferation of embryonic cells
occurs which have not reached the differentiation stage essential
for specialised functions i.e. the cells proliferate as
undifferentiated or as partially differentiated stem cells and an
embryonal tumour is formed.
Tumours of infancy and childhood have some features of
normal embryonic or foetal cells in them which proliferate under
growth promoting influence of oncogenes and suffer from
mutations which make them appear morphologically
malignant.
Under appropriate conditions, these malignant embryo-
nal cells may cease to proliferate and transform into non-
proliferating mature differentiated cells e.g. a neonatal
neuroblastoma may mature and differentiate into benign
ganglioneuroma; tissues in foetal sacrococcygeal teratoma
may mature with age to adult tissues and is assigned better
prognosis.
Thus, normal somatic cell maturation and neoplastic
development in embryonal tumours represent two opposite
ends of ontogenesis, with capability of some such tumours to
mature and differentiate to turn benign from malignant.
Benign Tumours and Tumour-like Conditions
Many of the benign tumours seen in infancy and childhood
are actually growth of displaced cells and masses of tissues
and their proliferation takes place along with the growth of
the child. Some of these tumours undergo a phase of
spontaneous regression subsequently—a feature usually not
seen in true benign tumours. While some consider such
lesions as mere ‘tumour-like lesions or malformations’, others
call them benign tumours. A few such examples are as under:
TABLE 10.3: Common Paediatric Benign Tumours and Tumour-like Lesions.
Nomenclature
Main Features
BENIGN TUMOURS
i. Haemangioma
• Most common in infancy
• Commonly on skin (e.g. port-wine stain)
• May regress spontaneously
ii. Lymphangioma
• Cystic and cavernous type common
• Located in skin or deeper tissues
• Tends to increase in size after birth
iii. Sacrococcygeal teratoma
• Often accompanied with other congenital malformations
• Majority (75%) are benign; rest are immature or malignant
iv. Fibromatosis
• Solitary (which generally behaves as benign) to multifocal (aggressive lesions)
TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS/BENIGN TUMOURS
i. Naevocellular naevi
• Very common lesion on the skin
ii. Liver cell adenoma
• Most common benign tumour of liver
iii. Rhabdomyoma
• Rare foetal and cardiac tumour
1.
Hamartomas. Hamartomas are focal accumulations of
cells normally present in that tissue but are arranged in an
abnormal manner i.e. though present at normal site they do
not reproduce normal architecture identical to adjacent
tissues (page 193).
2.
Choristoma (heterotopia). Choristoma or heterotopia is
collection of normal cells and tissues at aberrant locations
e.g. heterotopic pancreatic tissue in the wall of small bowel
or stomach.
A list of common benign tumours and tumour-like lesions
is presented in Table 10.3.
Malignant  Tumours
Cancers of infancy and childhood differ from those in adults
in the following respects:
1.
Sites. Cancers of this age group more commonly pertain
to haematopoietic system, neural tissue and soft tissues
compared to malignant tumours in adults at sites such as
the lung, breast, prostate, colon and skin.
2.
Genetic basis. Many of paediatric malignant tumours
have underlying genetic abnormalities.
3.
Regression. Foetal and neonatal malignancies have a
tendency to regress spontaneously or to mature.
4.
Histologic features. These tumours have unique histo-
logic features in having primitive or embryonal appearance
rather than pleomorphic-anaplastic histologic appearance.
5.
Management. Many of paediatric malignant tumours are
curable by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy but may
develop second malignancy.
A few generalisations can be drawn about paediatric
cancers:
In infants and children under 4 years of age: the most
common malignant tumours are various types of blastomas.
Children between 5 to 9 years of age: haematopoietic
malignancies are more common.
In the age range of 10-14 years (prepubertal age): soft tissue
and bony sarcomas are the prominent tumours.

INTRODUCTION
The last chapter in General Pathology deals with the
techniques and applications of basic cytologic methods in a
diagnostic pathology laboratory.
As mentioned in the beginning of this book, surgical
pathology developed as a prospective diagnostic branch
around the turn of 19th Century. Its basis was application of
knowledge of morphological details of cells for diagnosis of
disease in biopsy material. This generated interest of workers
towards obtaining cellular material by non-biopsy techniques
to arrive at the diagnosis. As a result, cytopathologic
diagnosis was initially introduced purely as Exfoliative
Cytology in the 1920s by Dr. George N. Papanicolaou.
Subsequently, success of bone marrow aspiration for diagnosis
of haematopoietic diseases generated interest in aspiration
biopsy for diagnosis of solid lesions in the 1930s, which
evolved over the next three decades mainly in Scandinavian
countries in Europe and later spread to the rest of the world
to become the mainstay branch of diagnostic cytology known
as Interventional Cytology.
In general, diagnostic cytology pertains to the
interpretation of cells from the human body that either
exfoliate (desquamate) spontaneously from epithelial
surfaces, or the cells are obtained from various organs/
tissues by different clinical procedures. While histopathologic
diagnosis is based on interpretation of changes in tissue
architecture, the cytopathologic diagnosis rests upon
alterations in morphology observed in single cells or small
groups of cells.
Role of Diagnostic Cytology
Among the numerous applications of cytodiagnostic
techniques, the following are more important:
1.
Diagnosis and management of cancer. In the field of
oncology, establishing a ‘tissue diagnosis’ (i.e. pathologic
diagnosis based on microscopic evidence of malignancy) is
an essential pre-requisite for proper management of a cancer
patient.
i)
Cytodiagnosis in its traditional role is a valuable adjunct
to histopathology for establishing the vital tissue diagnosis
e.g. diagnosis of lymphomas where imprint smears prove
valuable, and in some respects superior to histopathology
in typing the lymphoma.
ii) Cytologic techniques also provide a preliminary diagnosis
of cancer for later confirmation by histopathology e.g.
detection of ovarian cancer cells in ascitic fluid.

Basic Diagnostic Cytology*
Chapter 11
iii) In some fields, cytodiagnosis has replaced histopatho-
logy as the primary method of establishing a tissue diagnosis
e.g. in breast cancer, where positive cytologic report is
considered sufficient for planning the management,
obviating the need for diagnostic surgical biopsy.
iv) Cytodiagnosis has a major role in the detection and diag-
nosis of clinically silent early cancer e.g. carcinoma in situ of
the uterine cervix.
v) In the management of cancer, cytodiagnosis may help in
assessing response to therapy e.g. cervical smears for response
to radiotherapy in carcinoma cervix, and urinary cytology
for response to chemotherapy in carcinoma of the urinary
bladder.
vi) In the follow-up of previously diagnosed cases of cancer,
it is of particular value in detecting dissemination (metastasis)
or recurrence of tumour.
2.
Identification of benign neoplasms. This application is
derived from its ability to distinguish between benign and
malignant neoplasms e.g. fibroadenoma of the breast versus
carcinoma.
3.
Intraoperative pathologic diagnosis. In this role, cyto-
diagnosis complements histopathologic diagnosis e.g.
imprint smears alongwith frozen section for breast lumps.
4.
Diagnosis of non-neoplastic/inflammatory conditions.
Cytodiagnosis allows recognition of specific conditions which

do not routinely require surgical intervention e.g.
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.
5.
Diagnosis of specific infections. A variety of bacterial,
viral, protozoal and fungal infections can be identified by
cytologic methods e.g. tubercle bacilli in lymph node
aspirates, herpetic inclusions and Trichomonas in cervico-
vaginal smears, fungal hyphae in touch preparations from
draining sinuses.
6.
Cytogenetics. Cytodiagnostic techniques can be emplo-
yed for chromosomal studies including leucocyte and tissue
cultures and for demonstrating sex-chromatin e.g. buccal
smear for Barr body.
7.
Assessment of hormonal status in women. Vaginal
smears accurately reflect changes in female sex hormonal
levels e.g. to confirm the onset of menopause.
8.
Identification of cell of origin. For example, identifi-
cation of spermatogenic elements in aspirates from the testes
in cases of male infertility.
For cytomorphological recognition of cancer, nuclear charac-
teristics are used to determine the presence or absence of
malignancy (Table 11.1). Cytoplasmic characteristics help in
typing the malignancy e.g.keratinisation in squamous cell
carcinoma, mucin droplets in adenocarcinoma, melanin
pigment in melanomas.
Branches of Diagnostic Cytology
Two branches of diagnostic cytology are currently recog-
nised: exfoliative and interventional.
EXFOLIATIVE CYTOLOGY. This is the older branch that
essentially involves the study of cells spontaneously shed
off (as a result of continuous growth of epithelial linings)
from epithelial surfaces into body cavities or body fluids.
Exfoliative cytology is facilitated by the fact that the rate of
exfoliation is enhanced in disease-states thereby yielding a
larger number of cells for study. In addition, cells for study
may also be obtained by scraping, brushing, or washing
various mucosal surfaces (abrasive cytology).
INTERVENTIONAL CYTOLOGY. This is the branch in
which samples are obtained by clinical procedures or
surgical intervention. It is dominated by, and is virtually
synonymous with, Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology
(FNAC) which is also known as Aspiration Biopsy Cyto-
logy (ABC). In interventional cytology, the cytopathologist
often performs the clinical procedure himself and interacts
with the patient in contrast to exfoliative cytology where
the samples are prepared and forwarded by the clinician to
the pathologist and the cytopathologist interprets them in
isolation.
A brief account of both main branches of cytology is
given below while their contrasting features are presented
in Table 11.2.
EXFOLIATIVE CYTOLOGY
Type of samples that can be obtained from different organ
systems for exfoliative cytodiagnosis are listed in Table 11.3.
Apparently, a comprehensive review of each type of sample
is beyond the scope of this text. Cytology of female genital
tract is discussed in detail below while brief mention is made
about other samples.
I. FEMALE GENITAL TRACT
Smears from the female genital tract have traditionally been
known as ‘Pap smears’. These smears may be prepared by

different methods depending upon the purpose for which
they are intended:
i)
Lateral vaginal smears (LVS) obtained by scraping the
upper third of the lateral walls of the vagina are ideal for
cytohormonal assessment.
ii) Vaginal ‘pool’ or ‘vault’ smears are obtained by scraping or
aspirating material from the posterior fornix of the vagina
and are recommended for detection of endometrial and
ovarian cancer.
iii) Cervical smears obtained by cotton swabs or Ayre’s spatula
from the portio of the cervix are ideal for detection of cervical
carcinoma.
iv) Combined (Fast) smears are a combination of vaginal pool
and cervical scrapings. They offer the advantages of both
and are recommended for routine population screening as
they allow detection of up to 97% of cervical cancers and
about 90% of endometrial cancers when properly prepared.
v) Triple (cervical-vaginal-endocervical or CVE) smears contain
three distinct samples representing the ectocervix, vagina and
endocervix on three separate areas of the same slide. These
smears are also recommended for routine screening as they
allow localisation of lesions but are difficult to prepare.
vi) Endocervical and endometrial smears may also be prepared
by aspirating the contents of the endocervical canal and
endometrial cavity respectively.
CELLS IN NORMAL COMBINED SMEARS. Normally,
combined smear contains two types of cells: epithelial and
others (Fig. 11.1):
Epithelial cells. There are 4 types of squamous epithelial cells
in the cervical smear: superficial, intermediate, parabasal and
basal cells. Morphological features of these cells are summed
up in Table 11.4. A few variants of morphological forms and
other epithelial cells are as under:
Navicular cells are boat-shaped intermediate cells with
folded cell borders. These cells appear in latter half of the
menstrual cycle, during pregnancy and menopause.
Lactation cells are parabasal cells with strongly acidophilic
cytoplasm. These cells are seen so long as lactation persists.
Endocervical cells appear either as single dispersed nuclei
due to degeneration, or as clusters of columnar cells giving
it honey-combed appearance. Nuclei of endocervical cells are
vesicular, with fine granular chromatin and contain 1-2
nucleoli, while the cytoplasm is slightly basophilic or
vacuolated.
Endometrial cells are seen up to 12th day of menstrual
cycle. They are slightly smaller than endocervical cells,
appear as tight rounded clusters of overlapping cells with
moderately dark oval nuclei and scanty basophilic,
vacuolated cytoplasm.
Trophoblastic cells are seen following abortion or after
delivery.

CHAPTER 11
Basic Diagnostic Cytology
Other cells. Besides epithelial cells, other cells in cervical
smears are leucocytes and Döderlein bacilli:
Leucocytes in cervical smear include polymorphonuclear
neutrophils (in large numbers normally), lymphocytes
(isolated and entrapped in mucus normally), plasma cells
(in chronic cervicitis), macrophages (normally in first 10 days
of the menstrual cycle) and multinucleate cells (in specific
inflammation).
Döderlein bacilli (Bacillus vaginalis/Lactobacillus acidophilis),
which belong to the group of lactobacilli, are the predominant
organisms of the normal vaginal flora. It is a slender, gram-
positive, rod-like organism staining pale blue with the
Papanicolaou technique. These organisms utilise the
glycogen contained in the cytoplasm of intermediate and
parabasal cells resulting in their disintegration (cytolysis).
They are most numerous in the luteal phase and during
pregnancy.
APPLICATIONS OF PAP SMEAR
Cytohormonal Evaluation
Assessment of hormonal status is best carried out from lateral
vaginal smears although vaginal ‘pool’ or fast smears may
also be used. Ideally, at least 3 smears obtained on alternate
days should be scrutinised and cytologic indices determined
for each smear for accurate assessment.
Several indices are available for description of cyto-
hormonal patterns. The most commonly used are as under:
i)
Acidophilic index (AI): The relative proportion of cells
containing acidophilic (pink) and basophilic (blue) cytoplasm
are determined by AI.
ii) Pyknotic index (PI): The percentage of cells having small,
dark, shrunken nuclei (less than 6 μm in size) is determined
by PI. The PI is more reliable than AI as it is not influenced
by many of the cytoplasmic artefacts e.g. acidophilia caused
by drying of smears prior to fixation that affects the latter.
iii) Maturation index (MI): MI is the most widely used
method. One hundred squamous cells are counted and
grouped according to their type—parabasal, intermediate,
or superficial (basal cells are virtually absent from normal
vaginal smears). Their proportions are expressed as a
percentage; for example 10/80/10 represents parabasal,
intermediate and superficial cells respectively. Some
representative MIs at different stages of life are listed in
Table 11.5.
Abnormal Combined Smears
In order to evolve a system acceptable to clinicians and
cytopathologists, National Cancer Institute Workshop in 1988
developed the Bethesda System (TBS) for uniformity in
evaluation as well as limitations of reporting in cervico-
vaginal cytopathology; this was subsequently modified in
1991 and further updated in 2001. Criteria followed in the
Bethesda system are given in Chapter 26. Briefly, it has three
basic components in recommnedations:
1.
Specimen adequacy: It is an important component of
quality assurance and provides feedback regarding sampling
technique. It implies properly labelled, adequately fixed
smears having sufficient number of evenly spread, well
preserved cells as evaluated microscopically.
2.
General categorisation: It includes categorising the smear
in one of the three broad categories: within normal limits,
benign cellular changes, and epithelial cell abnormalities.
3.
Descriptive diagnosis: Final aspect of the Bethesda
system includes detailed description of the benign cellular
changes or epithelial cell abnormalities in the smear.
Based on it, the cellular changes in cervical smears are
described under 2 headings: non-neoplastic (or benign) and
neoplastic epithelial cell abnormalities.
NON-NEOPLASTIC (BENIGN) CELLULAR CHANGES:
i)
NON-SPECIFIC INFLAMMATORY CHANGES.
Inflammatory changes not associated with any specific
infection or identifiable infectious agent (i.e. non-specific
inflammation) are commonly seen in smears of the female
genital tract as under:
Acute inflammatory changes are characterised by an
increase in the number of parabasal cells (due to disruption
of superficial layers of the epithelium resulting in exposure
of deeper layers), cytoplasmic acidophilia and vacuolisation,
leucocytic migration into cytoplasm, and perinuclear halos
with nuclear pyknosis or enlargement.
Chronic inflammatory changes (Reactive changes) manifest
in squamous cells as nuclear enlargement, hyperchromatism,
and nucleolar prominence, with multinucleation in some
instances. Endocervical cells may show reparative
hyperplasia and/or squamous metaplasia.
ii) SPECIFIC INFLAMMATORY CHANGES. Specific
inflammatory changes may be associated with a variety of
infectious agents, the common among which are listed in
Table 11.6.
a) Bacterial agents:
N. gonorrhoeae (the gonococcus) is a gram-negative diplo-
coccus which is an intracellular micro-organism. It may be
observed under oil-immersion within intermediate or
parabasal squamous cells and polymorphonuclear leucocytes

as tiny paired coffee-bean organisms. However, a definitive
diagnosis requires bacterial culture.
Gardnerella vaginalis, a gram-negative rod, is a frequent
cause of bacterial vaginitis. It manifests in smears as blue
stained cocco-bacillary organism covering and imparting a
grainy appearance to affected squamous cells (so called ‘clue
cells’) against a clean background devoid of Döderlein bacilli.
Tuberculosis of the female genital tract usually manifests
as tuberculous salpingitis or endometritis, but may involve
the uterine cervix. While Mycobacterium tuberculosis cannot
be identified in Papanicolaou stained smears, tuberculous
granulomas composed of epithelioid macrophages with
accompanying Langhans’ giant cells may occasionally be
identified.
b) Viral agents:
Human papilloma virus (HPV) is one of the commonest
sexually-transmitted infections. There are 2 types of HPVs:
low-risk and high-risk types. Low-risk HPV, most commonly
types 6 and 11, are involved in causation of anogenital wart
or condyloma acuminatum. High-risk HPV, most often types
16 and 18, are strongly implicated in precancerous lesions of
ectocervical epithelium leading to cervical cancer.
Morphologically, smears from HPV-infected subjects show
aggregates of rounded to oval squamous cells with blunted
cell margins, peripheral cytoplasmic condensation and
crisply outlined perinuclear halos, with dysplastic or
degenerative changes of nuclei; these changes are collectively
termed ‘koilocytotic changes.’ (see Fig. 11.4). HPV can also
be identified by Southern blot, PCR, in situ hybridization and
by hybrid capture.
Genital infection by herpes simplex virus (HSV) commonly
affects the squamous epithelium of the vulva, vagina and
cervix, but may ascend to involve endocervical and
endometrial epithelium. Infected cells show enlarged nuclei
with watery, ‘ground-glass’ chromatin, multinucleation with
internuclear moulding, and intranuclear acidophilic
inclusions.
c)
Fungal agents:
Moniliasis (infection by Candida albicans) is the
commonest fungal infection of the female genital tract and
is particularly associated with diabetes, pregnancy and use
of antibacterial agents (which alter the vaginal flora). Candida
appears in smears in two forms—the yeast form (unicellular)
appears as round to oval budding organisms with
inconspicuous capsules, and the fungal form (pseudohyphae)
as thin, elongated, pseudoseptate, bamboo-like filaments
(Fig. 11.2).
Torulopsis glabrata causes less than 10% of mycotic vaginal
infections. It is related to Candida, appears in smears as
round budding organisms with thick capsule-like halos, and
does not form pseudohyphae in vivo.
d) Parasitic agents:
Up to 25% of adult women are estimated to harbour
Trichomonas vaginalis in their lower genital tract. Smears from
infected women may not show any cytomorphological
changes or may show non-specific acute inflammatory
changes. The protozoan appears in the background as a
fuzzy, grey-green, round or elliptical structure 8 to 20 μm in
size, containing a small vesicular nucleus (Fig. 11.3).
Entamoeba histolytica in trophozoite form appears in Pap
smears as basophilic, round to oval structures, 15 to 20 μm

nucleus with a central karyosome.
NEOPLASTIC EPITHELIAL CELL ABNORMALITIES:
Carcinoma of the uterine cervix still ranks high in the list as
the most frequent cancer in developing countries of the world
and is the leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality.
Vast majority of cervical cancers are of the squamous cell
type, and the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the
cervix and its precursor lesions is considered as the most
important application of exfoliative cytology.
Neoplastic epithelial changes are described below under
2 headings: squamous cell abnormalities and glandular cell
abnormalities.
1.
SQUAMOUS CELL ABNORMALITIES: The fully-
developed invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine
cervix is preceded by a pre-invasive intraepithelial neoplastic
process that is recognisable on histologic and cytologic
examination.
Morphogenesis and nomenclature. The earliest recognisable
change is hyperplasia of basal or reserve cells which normally
constitute a single layer at the deepest part of the epithelium.
The proliferating reserve cells next develop certain atypical
features i.e. hyperchromasia and increased nuclear size. The
continued proliferation of these atypical cells with loss of
polarity, a concomitant increase in mitotic activity, and
progressive involvement of more and more layers of the
epithelium is known as dysplasia (disordered growth). When
dysplasia involves the full thickness of the epithelium and
the lesion morphologically resembles squamous cell
carcinoma without invasion of underlying stroma, it is
termed carcinoma in situ (CIS). CIS further evolves through
the stage of microinvasive carcinoma (with depth of stromal
invasion not exceeding 3 mm) into full-blown invasive
squamous cell carcinoma.
Previously depending on the degree of epithelial
involvement, three grades of dysplasia were recognised:
mild, moderate and severe. As the stages of dysplasia and
CIS represented a continuous spectrum of lesions seen in
the precancerous state, they were collectively termed ‘cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia’ (CIN) and categorised as under
(also see Fig. 24.5):
CIN I
Mild
Primitive (atypical) cells,
dysplasia
proliferating in lower
third of epithelium.
CIN II
Moderate
Involvement up to
dysplasia
middle-third of epithelium.
CIN III
Severe
Involvement of upper-third
dysplasia
of epithelium.
Carcinoma
Involvement of full
in situ (CIS)
thickness of epithelium.
Presently, the Bethesda system divides squamous cell
abnormalities into four categories:
Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance
(ASCUS) which represents cellular changes falling short of
intraepithelial lesion.
Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (L-SIL) that
includes CIN-I and cellular changes associated with HPV
infection.
High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (H-SIL) includes
CIN grade II, III and CIS.
Squamous cell carcinoma.
Cytomorphology. Precancerous states can be distinguished
from invasive carcinoma on the basis of cytomorphological
features observed in smears. In dysplastic epithelium,
stratification and maturation of cytoplasm occurs above the
layers of proliferating primitive cells while the nuclear
abnormalities persist. Cells exfoliating from the surface, thus,
display cytoplasmic maturation and differentiation with
nuclear atypia and are known as dyskaryotic cells.
The character and type of dyskaryotic cells observed in
smears reflect the severity of dysplasia:
In mild dysplasia (CIN-I or L-SIL), maturation occurs in
the upper two thirds of the epithelium and exfoliated
dyskaryotic cells are of the superficial type. These cells show
Figure 11.4
L-SIL. The smear shows koilocytes having abundant
vacuolated cytoplasm and nuclear enlargement (arrow).
Figure 11.5
H-SIL. The squamous cells have scanty cytoplasm and
markedly hyperchromatic nuclei having irregular nuclear outlines. The
background shows numerous PMNs.

272
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
cytoplasmic vacuolation (koilocytosis) and nuclear
enlargement (Fig. 11.4).
With increasing dysplasia (CIN-II and CIN-III, or H-SIL),
the proliferating primitive cells reach closer to the epithelial
surface, less cytoplasmic maturation/differentiation occurs,
and dyskaryotic intermediate and parabasal cells are
observed in smears (Fig. 11.5).
Progression to CIS (CIN-III or H-SIL) manifests as subtle
alterations in cell arrangement and morphology (with
predominantly basal and parabasal cells in smears).
Onset of invasive carcinoma is heralded by the
appearance of macronucleoli, cytoplasmic orangeophilia and
presence of tumour diathesis (dirty, necrotic background)
(Fig. 11.6).
2. GLANDULAR CELL ABNORMALITIES. The Bethesda
system categorises glandular abnormalities as under:
Atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGUS)
which represent nuclear atypia of endocervical and
endometrial cells exceeding reparative changes.
Endocervical and endometrial adenocarcinoma, both of which
can be detected from Pap smears; cytomorphological features
allowing distinction between these two types of malignancies
are summed up in Table 11.7.
Cells from extrauterine cancers may also be present in Pap
smears, majority originating from the ovaries. Clues to the
extrauterine origin of cancer cells include: the absence of a
tumour diathesis, arrangement of cancer cells in glandular
and papillary configuration (accompanied by psammoma
bodies in some instances), and absence of dysplastic changes
in coexistent cervico-endometrial cells.
Automation in Cervical Cytology
Introduction of automated devices like PapNet for primary
screening is a major technologic achievement in recent
times. Automation offers routine pre-screening of hundreds
of Pap smears, decreasing the workload of cytopathologists
and at the same time providing quality assurance. It can be
applied to conventional Pap smears or to Thin-Preps
(discussed later).
II. RESPIRATORY TRACT
Cellular material from the respiratory tract may be obtained
as a result of spontaneous expectoration (sputum), aspiration
or brushing during bronchoscopic procedures.
1.
SPUTUM EXAMINATION. Sputum is produced by a
spontaneous deep cough bringing up material from small
airways and alveoli. The cough reflex may also be triggered
artificially by aerosol-inhalation of cough-stimulating
substances (e.g. propylene glycol with hypertonic saline).
Sputum examination is advantageous as samples are easily
obtained and the cellular content is representative of the
entire respiratory tract (satisfactory specimens allow
diagnosis of over 80% of lung cancers). However, a large
number of cells have to be scrutinised and the specimen
does not allow localisation of the lesion within the
respiratory tract.
2.
BRONCHIAL ASPIRATION (WASHINGS) AND
BRONCHIAL BRUSHING. Cellular material obtained by
aspiration brushing or bronchial washing, or by bronchio-

Basic Diagnostic Cytology
alveolar lavage (BAL) during bronchoscopy allows
localisation of lesions to specific areas of the respiratory tract.
Moreover, specimens are easier to study as the cellularity is
less than that of sputum. However, bronchoscopic
procedures are unpleasant for patients, time-consuming and
require considerable expertise.
III. GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT
Lesions in the oral cavity may be sampled by scraping the
surface with wooden and metal tongue-depressors. For the
oesophagus and stomach, samples are obtained under direct
vision by brushing or lavage through fibreoptic endoscopes.
For cytologic samples from the stomach, the older method
of blind lavage through a Ryle’s tube using isotonic saline or
Ringer’s solution have largely been replaced nowadays by
direct mucosal visualisation by the endoscopist and collection
of cytologic sample while doing a biopsy. Cytology samples
from the colon may also obtained by brushing during
colonoscopy or lavage following enema to clean the colon.
IV. URINARY TRACT
1.
URINARY SEDIMENT CYTOLOGY. Cytological
evaluation of the urinary tract is most often carried out by
examining the sediment of voided or catheterised specimens
of urine. It is convenient for the patient and a useful method
for study of both the upper and lower urinary tracts, provided
the samples are collected and processed in the correct manner
(page 276). While voided specimens are satisfactory in men,
catheterisation is often preferred in women to avoid contami-
nation by vaginal cells and menstrual blood.
2.
BLADDER IRRIGATION (WASHINGS). Washings of
the urinary bladder obtained at cystoscopy are preferred in
symptomatic patients when bladder tumours are suspected.
The procedure provides excellent cytological preparations.
3.
RETROGRADE CATHETERISATION. For suspected
lesions of the upper urinary tract, voided urine is usually
satisfactory. While renal parenchymal cells are infrequent in
urine, material obtained from the renal pelvis and ureter
contains adequate quantity of these cells. In some instances,
retrograde catheterisation and brushing of the ureter and
renal pelvis are utilised for localisation of lesions.
4.
PROSTATIC MASSAGE. Prostatic secretions are
obtained by prostatic massage and the sample is collected
directly onto a glass slide and smeared. The procedure is
rarely used nowadays with the advent of direct sampling of
the prostate by FNAC.
Diagnostic Utility of Urinary Cytology
While evaluating the utility of urinary cytology in the diag-
nosis of urothelial tumours, following aspects need to be kept
in mind:
1.
Papillary tumours of low-grade are lined by urothelium
showing no morphological abnormalities or only slight
cellular and nuclear abnormalities. Such tumours cannot be
diagnosed on cytologic material with any degree of certainty.
2.
High-grade papillary tumours, sessile tumours and carci-
noma in situ where urothelial cells exhibit cytomorphological
abnormalities, are readily diagnosed by urinary cytology.
3.
Urothelial tumours are often synchronous or meta-
chronous and may involve different regions of the urinary tract.
Urinary cytology is, thus, of immense value in the follow-up
of patients with previously diagnosed urothelial tumours.
V. BODY FLUIDS
For the sake of convenience, the cytology of body fluids can
be discussed under following two headings:
A. Effusions in body cavities
B. Fluids of small volume.
A. EFFUSIONS
Effusion refers to the accumulation of fluid in any of the three
body cavities (pleural, pericardial and peritoneal). An
effusion in the peritoneal cavity is also known as ascites.
Effusions have traditionally been classed as transudates or
exudates. This distinction is important in diagnostic cytology
as malignant effusions are invariably exudates with a protein
content greater than 3 gm/dl (see Table 5.1, page 96).
Diagnostic cytology of effusions on samples obtained by
paracentesis is mainly related to the identification of
malignancy, and wherever possible, its classification. In
benign effusions, cytological findings are mostly non-specific.
Cellular Components in Effusions
Two main primary component cells of effusions are
mesothelial cells and macrophages or histiocytes. Effusion
causes disruption of the mesothelial lining and these cells
collect in the fluid individually or as small groups.
Macrophages appear as mononuclear cells of the size of
mesothelial cells distributed singly or as loose clusters.
However, macrophages have ill-defined cell border
compared to mesothelial and may have cytoplasmic
vacuoles. Moreover, the nuclei in the macrophages are
eccentric and kidney-shaped while those of mesothelial cells
are central and round.
In addition, the effusion may have the following cellular
components:
CELLS IN BENIGN EFFUSIONS. These include reactive
proliferations of mesothelial cells in inflammation,
polymorphonulcear neutrophils in acute suppurative
inflammation, and lymphocytes in chronic fluid collections.
When lymphocytes are dominant cells in the effusion fluid
in fibrin-rich background, the possibility of tuberculosis is
considered. In tuberculous effusions, granulomas, epithelioid
cells or Langhans’ giant cells may not be seen; stain for
tubercle bacilli may sometimes be of value.
CELLS IN MALIGNANT EFFUSIONS. Malignant cells in
effusion may of origin from primary tumour (e.g.
mesothelioma) or from secondary/metastatic tumour; the
latter being more common the case.
Mesothelioma. It is uncommon and is more often epithelial
type since fibrous mesothelioma does not exfoliate cells in

274
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
the effusion. Epithelial cells of mesothelioma require to be
distinguished from adenocarcinoma cells.
Adenocarcinomas. These are the most common malignant
cellular component in the effusions. They mostly represent
metastasis from primary adenocarcinomas such as from the
stomach, lung, breast, colon, and ovary. Less frequent sources
are adenocarcinoma of the biliary system, pancreas and liver.
Most adenocarcinomas show similar morphologic
appearance and thus it may not be possible to comment on
the possible primary site of origin of the adenocarcinoma on
morphology alone (Fig. 11.7).
Squamous cell carcinoma. Effusion may rarely have
malignant squamous cells in it and represent metastasis from
carcinoma lung, oesophagus or uterine cervix.
Small cell carcinoma. Cytologic features of small cell
carcinoma of the lung are quite characteristic—hyper-
chromatic moulded nuclei and scanty or no cytoplasm.
Lymphomas-leukaemias. Effusions may sometimes have
malignant cells of leukameia and lymphoma in line with
primary disease in the body.
B. FLUIDS OF SMALL VOLUME
Of the miscellaneous fluids included in this category, the
most common samples submitted for cytological evaluation
are cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and seminal fluid (semen).
Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)
CSF examination is an important part of complete neurologic
evaluation, both in non-neoplastic and neoplastic diseases
of the central nervous system. Samples are usually obtained
by lumbar puncture. Factors that are critical to the successful
cytological evaluation of CSF are as under:
i)
Speed of delivery to the laboratory and immediate
processing, as diagnostic material may disintegrate within
an hour resulting in false-negative diagnosis.
ii) Correct cytological processing and technique, since the
cell yield of CSF is generally low and faulty technique may
result in loss of cellular material or poor morphology.
Normal CSF. CSF is an ultrafiltrate of plasma with a total
volume of about 150 ml (in the adult). Cell content is low
(0-4/μl) comprising mainly lymphocytes or monocytes.
CSF in non-neoplastic diseases. Changes in CSF in various
non-neoplastic diseases are discussed in Chapter 30 (see
 Table 30.1).
CSF in neoplastic disease. Neoplasms that are in direct
contact with the CSF are most likely to shed cells which are
recoverable for scrutiny. Metastatic cancers (leukaemia,
lymphoma and adenocarcinoma), medulloblastomas, and
ependymomas shed the greatest amount of material. Though
meningioma occurs in the subarachnoid space, it rarely
exfoliates sufficient material for diagnosis. Low-grade
gliomas do not generally shed sufficient cells although high-
grade gliomas may yield adequate cellular material for
diagnosis.
Seminal Fluid (Semen)
Examination of seminal fluid (semen analysis) is one of the
tests for investigating infertile couples, and is also used to
check the adequacy of vasectomy. Samples are obtained by
masturbation or coitus interruptus after observing at least 4
days of sexual abstinence and assessed on the following lines:
1.
Volume. Normal volume is between 2.5 and 5 ml.
2.
Viscosity and pH. When ejaculated, semen is fairly viscid
but liquefies in about 10 to 30 minutes. It is usually alkaline
(pH about 8).
3.
Motility. Normally, within 2 hours of ejaculation, at least
60% of the spermatozoa are vigorously motile; in 6 to 8 hours
25 to 40% are still motile.
4.
Count. Counting is done in a Neubauer chamber after
suitable dilution. Normally, 60 million or more spermatozoa
are present per ml. Currently, automated counters for semen
are also available.
5.
Morphology. Stained smears are used to assess
morphology. Normally, not more than 20% of spermatozoa
are morphologically abnormal (e.g. double-head, pointed-
head, or swollen).
6.
Fructose. Seminal fructose estimation (normal levels 150-
600 mg/dl) complements cytological analysis. Low levels of
seminal fructose indicate obstruction at the level of
ejaculatory ducts.
Results of semen analysis need to be interpreted with
caution as infertility is caused by several factors in the couple.
As discussed in Chapter 23, other causes of infertility need
to be evaluated before it is ascribed to abnormalities in semen.
Even specimens with several abnormal features need not
necessarily be the cause of infertility.
VI. BUCCAL SMEARS FOR SEX CHROMATIN BODIES
Sex-specific chromatin bodies are observed in interphase
nuclei and comprise the Barr body (X chromatin) and the
Figure 11.7
Pleural fluid positive for signet ring cells (adeno-
carcinoma stomach). There are large number of malignant cells scattered
singly or in small clusters having characteristic cytoplasmic vacuoles,
nuclear hyperchromasia and prominent nucleoli.

275
CHAPTER 11
Basic Diagnostic Cytology
fluorescent or F body (Y chromatin). The number of Barr
bodies observed in interphase nuclei is one less than the
number of X chromosome (n–1), whereas the number of F
bodies observed is equal to the number of Y chromosomes
present (n). In effect, the Barr body is specific for females
and the F body for males (page 257).
1.
DEMONSTRATION OF BARR BODY (X CHROMA-
TIN). In buccal smears, the Barr body appears as a plano-
convex mass about 1 μm in diameter applied to the inner
surface of the nuclear membrane. The interphase nuclei of
one hundred intermediate squamous epithelial cells are
scrutinised. In normal females, Barr bodies are present in at
least 20% of nuclei (Fig. 11.8, A). Males have a Barr body
count of less than 2%. Vaginal smears may also be used for
Barr body counts (page 257).
2.
DEMONSTRATION OF THE F BODY (Y CHROMA-
TIN). Demonstration of the F body requires fluorescent
staining in contrast to the Barr body which may be observed
on routine Papanicolaou-stained smears. On staining buccal
smears with quinacrine mustard, the intensely fluorescent F
body is observed in about 60% of interphase nuclei in males
and in less than 8% of nuclei in females. The F body is also
demonstrable in the nuclei of lymphocytes in a peripheral
blood film stained with quinacrine mustard.
3.
COUNTING OF DRUMSTICK APPENDAGE. The
presence and frequency of drumstick appendages attached
to nuclei of polymorphonuclear leucocytes on a peripheral
blood film may also be used for determining sex. At least
500 neutrophilic leucocytes are scrutinised in a Romanowsky-
stained blood film. Genetic females show drumsticks in 3-
6% of neutrophils (Fig. 11.8, B). In males, the frequency of
drumsticks is less than 0.3%.
TECHNIQUES IN EXFOLIATIVE CYTOLOGY
A brief resume of methods for collection of specimens and
processing of samples for exfoliative cytodiagnosis is
outlined below under 4 headings: collection, fixation and
fixatives, processing in the laboratory, and staining.
A. Collection of Samples
1.
PREPARATION OF COMBINED (FAST) SMEARS.
Smears should not be taken during menstrual bleeding. The
patient should not douche for at least 24 hours before the
smear is obtained.
i)
Smears are obtained under direct vision after introducing
a Cusco’s speculum with the patient in lithotomy position.
ii) Ideally, lubricants and medical jellies should not be used
for introducing the speculum since use of lubricants results
in contamination of the smear. If required, the speculum may
be moistened with a few drops of normal saline.
iii) The posterior fornix of the vagina is aspirated with a
blunt-ended glass pipette fitted with a rubber bulb. A drop of
the aspirate is placed at the unlabelled end of a glass slide.
iv) The ectocervix is sampled with the Ayre’s spatula
(Fig. 11.9). The longer limb of the spatula is fitted into the
external os and the spatula rotated through 360° to sample
the entire cervix. The scraped material on the spatula is then
placed on the drop aspirated from the vaginal pool and the
smear prepared with the spatula itself or with the tip of the
gloved finger (cotton swabs may be used instead of the Ayre’s
spatula, although the quality of smears is not as good).
v) Thin uniform smears should be prepared and the slide
immediately immersed in fixative to avoid artefacts in cells
caused by drying.
vi) Smears should be transported to the laboratory in the
fixative in a Coplin’s jar (discussed later).
Slides should ideally be labelled by using a diamond
pencil. If labels of sticking plaster are used, the labels must
not come into contact with the fixative.
2. LIQUID-BASED CYTOLOGY PREPARATIONS (THIN
PREPS). This is a special technique for preparation of
gynaecologic and non-gynaecologic samples which provides
uniform monolayered dispersion of cells on smears, without
overlapping or clump formation. It is a pre-requisite for
quantitative analysis and automated devices.
3.
PREPARATION OF LATERAL VAGINAL SMEARS
(LVS). The LVS is obtained by scraping the lateral walls of
the upper third of the vagina (at the level of the cervical
external os) with the flat surface of a wooden tongue
depressor and smearing the material directly onto labelled
slides. The patient is prepared and positioned as described
for the combined (fast) smear.
4.
COLLECTION OF SPUTUM. Fresh, unfixed, early
morning specimens resulting from overnight accumulation
of secretions are best for diagnostic purposes. A minimum
of at least three specimens collected on three successive days
should be examined. The patient is instructed to cough
deeply on waking up and to expectorate all sputum into a
Figure 11.8

of chromatin under the nuclear membrane. B, Blood film showing
presence of drumstick appendage attached to a nuclear lobe of the

276
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
clean, dry, wide-mouthed glass container or a petridish. Care
should be taken to avoid spitting into the container. The
container is capped or covered, labelled and transported to
the laboratory where smears are prepared.
5.
BRONCHIAL MATERIALS. All aspirated bronchial
secretions, lavage, washings and brushings must be
despatched to the laboratory without delay. If immediate
despatch is not possible, the sample should be collected in
fixative (50% ethanol in volumes equal to that of the sample).
6.
BUCCAL SMEARS. The mouth is rinsed with water or
normal saline and the buccal mucosa scraped vigorously with
a wooden or metal tongue depressor. The material is smeared
directly onto labelled glass slides which are placed in fixative.
7.
G.I. CYTOLOGY. In a case of suspected malignancy or
specific infections of GI tract, or for screening for Barrett’s
oesophagus, cytologic examination is indicated. The cytology
specimen is collected during fibreoptic endoscopy of the part
being visualised.
8.
URINE. Fresh catheterised specimens are preferred in
female patients while voided urine is satisfactory in males.
After initial morning voiding (which is discarded),
samples of about 50 to 100 ml are collected on three
consecutive days. Hydration by forced intake of fluids (1 glass
of water every 30 minutes over 3 hour period) is recom-
mended by some workers for production of high volume
specimens. If delay is anticipated in despatch to the
laboratory, the sample should be collected in an equal volume
of 50% ethanol.
The initial morning specimen is discarded as cells
deteriorate extremely quickly in acidic urine, and the
morphology of cells accumulating overnight in bladder urine
is distorted to an extreme degree. For the same reason,
24-hour collections of urine are useless for cytodiagnostic
purposes.
9.
EFFUSIONS. Pericardial, pleural and peritoneal fluids
are obtained by paracentesis. As these fluids are often
exudative in character, they may clot after removal from
respective cavities. Anticoagulants may be used to prevent
coagulation—heparin (3-5 units per ml), 3.8% sodium citrate
(1 ml per 10 ml), or EDTA (1 mg per ml) may be used for this
purpose.
If the fluids cannot be processed within 12 hours of
collection, an equal volume of 50% ethanol or 10% formalin
should be added.
10. CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF). CSF samples should
be despatched without delay to the laboratory for immediate
processing as the cells contained are extremely fragile. A gap
of even 1 hour between removal and processing may result
in loss of diagnostic cellular material.
11. SEMEN. Samples of seminal fluid obtained by
masturbation are best collected at the laboratory. Samples
obtained by coitus interruptus are collected in clean, dry test
tubes (or vials) and transported to the laboratory within 30
minutes. The patient is instructed to note the time of
ejaculation.
B. Fixation and Fixatives
All material for cytological examination must be properly
fixed to ensure preservation of cytomorphological details.
Methods of fixation vary depending upon the type of staining
employed:
Material for exfoliative cytodiagnosis is usually wet-fixed
i.e. smears are immersed in fixative without allowing them
to dry. These smears are then stained with Papanicolaou
(Pap) or haematoxylin and eosin (H & E) stains.
Sometimes, exfoliative cytology smears are air-dried for
use with the Romanowsky stains as are used in haematologic
studies. In Romanowsky staining, fixation is effected during
the staining procedure.
1.
ROUTINE FIXATIVES. The ideal fixative for routine use
is Papanicolaou’s fixative comprising a solution of equal parts
of ether and 95% ethanol. However, the flammability of ether
makes it hazardous. Most laboratories use 95% ethanol alone
with excellent results. Where ethanol is not available, 100%
methanol, 95% denatured alcohol, or 85% isopropyl alcohol
(isopropanolol) may be used.
Smears prepared at the bedside as well as those prepared
in the laboratory from fluid samples are immediately placed
in 95% ethanol without allowing them to dry prior to fixation.
Drying causes distortion of cells and induces cytoplasmic
staining artefacts. Fixation time of 10 to 15 minutes at room
temperature is adequate. Smears may also be left in the
fixative for 24 hours or more without any detrimental effect
as regards cytomorphological detail. Smears should be
transported to the laboratory in the fixative; screw-capped
Coplin jars are best for this purpose.
2.
COATING FIXATIVES. Coating fixatives are applied as
aerosol-sprays or with a dropper to the surface of freshly
Figure 11.9
Method of obtaining cervical smear with Ayre spatula
(fast smear).

277
CHAPTER 11
Basic Diagnostic Cytology
prepared smears. While commercial preparations (e.g.
cytospray) are available, a standard hairspray with a high
alcohol content is also a suitable alternative. Smears while
still wet, are placed face-up on a table and sprayed with the
nozzle held at a distance of 10 to 12 inches. A period of 10
minutes is sufficient for drying of coated smears, which may
then be wrapped or put in a box for transport to the
laboratory. Coating fixatives are ideal when unstained smears
are to be transported over long distances.
3.
SPECIAL PURPOSE FIXATIVES. Buffered neutral
formalin, Bouin’s fluid and picric acid are used for specific
purposes when required. Formalin vapour fixation is also
employed for some staining procedures.
4.
PRESERVATION OF FLUID SAMPLES. Samples of
fluids are best submitted to the laboratory in a fresh state for
immediate processing. Where a delay is anticipated in
despatch to the laboratory or in processing, the sample is
collected in a suitable preservative for ‘prefixation’ so that
cellular morphology is preserved. When the samples have
been processed and smears prepared, ‘fixation’ is effected
as described earlier.
Fluid samples with a high protein content (e.g. peri-
cardial, pleural and peritoneal fluids) may be preserved
under refrigeration for up to 12 hours without prefixation.
However, fluids with a low protein content (e.g. urine and
cerebrospinal fluid) deteriorate in 1 to 2 hours even if
refrigerated. Fluids with low pH (e.g. gastric lavage samples)
must be collected in pre-cooled preservative since cells
deteriorate extremely rapidly in such specimens.
The best preservative for general use is 50% ethanol in
volumes equal to that of the fluid sample. Ninety-five per
cent ethanol precipitates proteins and hardens the sediment
making smear preparation difficult; it is used only for gastric
aspirates. Pericardial, pleural and peritoneal fluids may be
pre-fixed with an equal volume of 10% formalin if ethanol is
not available. Solutions containing ether and acetone are not
used as preservatives as they cause extreme hardening of
the sediment making smear preparation virtually impossible.
C. Processing of Samples in the Laboratory
1.
PREPARED SMEARS. Smears prepared at the bedside
and wet-fixed in ethanol need no further processing in the
laboratory prior to staining.
2.
SPUTUM. The sample is prepared as under:
i)
The sample is placed in a petridish and inspected against
a dark background.
ii) Bloody, discoloured or solid particles are removed with
wooden applicator sticks and placed on glass slides. Strands
of ropy mucus are also selected (exfoliated cells adhere to
mucus strands).
iii) Clean glass slides are used to crush the particles/mucus
and spread the material evenly.
iv) Four such smears are prepared and immediately placed
in 95% ethanol for fixation.
3.
FLUID SPECIMENS. Large volumes of fluid received
are allowed to stand in the refrigerator for half to one hour.
After that, all except the bottom 200 ml is discarded. The
retained fluid is then processed. In specimens containing
excessive amounts of blood, erythrocytes may be lysed by
the addition of 1 ml of glacial acetic acid for every 50 ml of
specimen.
Commonly employed techniques for processing of fluids
are as under:
Sediment smears. The sample is poured into 50 ml centrifuge
tubes and centrifuged at 600 g for 10 minutes. (To achieve a
relative centrifugal force of 600 g, the speed of the centrifuge
in revolutions per minute varies with the rotating radius of
the centrifuge. With a rotating radius of 25 cm the required
speed is 1500 rpm).
Following centrifugation, the supernatant is decanted and
smears prepared from the sediment or cell button by
recovering the material with a glass pipette or a platinum
wire loop. Smear preparation from samples collected in a
preservative require albuminised slides as cell adhesiveness
is reduced by prefixation. Smears are wet-fixed in 95%
ethanol (or air-dried in some instances).
Cytocentrifuge and membrane filter preparations. These
methods are most useful for small volume fluids of low cell
content. The interested reader is referred to specialised texts
for descriptions of these methods.
D. Staining of Smears
Three staining procedures are commonly employed:
Papanicolaou and H&E stains are used for wet-fixed smears
while Romanowsky stains are used for air-dried smears.
1.
PAPANICOLAOU STAIN. Papanicolaou staining is the
best method for routine cytodiagnostic studies. Three
solutions are used comprising a nuclear stain and two
cytoplasmic counter-stains. Harris’ haematoxylin is the
nuclear stain. Orange G (OG-6) and eosin-alcohol (EA-65 or
EA-50) are the two cytoplasmic counterstains which impart
the orange and cyanophilic tints to cytoplasm respectively.
2.
H & E STAIN. The stain is essentially the same as that
used for histological sections. Harris’ haematoxylin is the
nuclear stain, and eosin is the cytoplasmic counterstain.
3.
ROMANOWSKY STAINS. Romanowsky stains used in
haematological preparations may also be used for cytological
smear preparations. Leishman’s, May-Grünwald-Giemsa
(MGG) and Wright’s stains are most commonly used.
INTERVENTIONAL CYTOLOGY
In interventional cytology, samples are obtained by
aspiration or surgical biopsy. This branch includes fine needle
aspiration cytology, imprint cytology, crush smear cytology
and biopsy sediment cytology.
I. FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION CYTOLOGY
Interventional cytology is virtually synonymous with Fine
Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC). The technique has
gained wide acceptance in the last four decades and is
increasingly being used to sample a wide variety of body

278
SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
tissues. Almost all organ systems are accessible to the fine
needle and versatility of the technique has enormously
increased the scope of diagnostic cytology. The applications
and advantages of FNAC, its procedure, complications and
limitations are detailed below.
A. APPLICATIONS OF FNAC
In routine practice, FNAC is most often used for diagnosis
of palpable mass lesions. Palpable lesions commonly
sampled are: breast masses, enlarged lymph nodes, enlarged
thyroid and superficial soft tissue masses. The salivary
glands, palpable abdominal lesions and the testicles are also
frequently sampled for FNAC. Other sites and lesions
accessible to FNAC are the prostate, pelvic organs, bone and
joint spaces, lungs, retroperitoneum and orbit.
B. ADVANTAGES OF FNAC
i)
FNAC is an OPD procedure and requires no hospitalisation
while surgical biopsies are obtained in the operation theatre
and hospitalisation is often required.
ii) No anaesthesia is required (except in specific circum-
stances), while surgical biopsy is performed under local or
general anaesthesia.
iii) The procedure is quick, safe and painless.
iv) Multiple attempts (or repeating the procedure) are possi-
ble without inconvenience, whereas repeating a surgical
biospy is uncomfortable and inconvenient for the patient.
v) Results are obtained rapidly with reports being available
in a matter of hours (turn-around time of 2 to 24 hours
depending on the urgency), while histopathological reports
are available after a longer duration (turn-around time of 2
to 4 days on account of time required for processing and
sectioning of tissues).
vi) It is a low-cost procedure which is cost-effective.
vii) As the cytopathologist performs the procedure himself,
he gains first-hand knowledge of the clinical findings which
facilitates interpretation of slides and enhances diagnostic
accuracy.
C. GENERAL PROCEDURE FOR FNAC
Materials
For performing FNAC, a syringe with a well-fitting needle,
syringe holder, some microscopic glass slides and a suitable
fixative are the only material required in most instances
(Fig. 11.10):
NEEDLES. Fine needles range from 25 to 20 gauge (0.6 mm
to 0.9 mm outer diameter). The standard 21 gauge disposable
needle of 38 mm length is suitable for routine transcutaneous
FNAC of palpable masses; 25 or 24 gauge disposable needles
of 25 mm length are used for lymph nodes and in children.
Larger needles, 80 to 160 mm in length, are required for
sampling the lung and abdominal viscera; 22 to 20 gauge
Chiba spinal puncture needles may be profitably employed
for this purpose. Needles of up to 200 mm length are used
for transrectal and transvaginal FNAC of the prostate and
ovary respectively. Aspiration of bony lesions may require
18 gauge (1 mm outer diameter) needles although superficial
lytic lesions are adequately sampled with a 21 gauge needle.
SYRINGES. Syringes of 10 to 20 ml capacity are suitable.
Syringe holders such as the Franzen handle permit a single-
hand grip during aspiration, employing disposable syringes.
For needles with metal hubs (e.g. spinal puncture needles),
disposable syringes should be used to ensure a proper fit
between the needle hub and syringe nozzle.
GLASS SLIDES AND FIXATIVE. Four or six standard
microscopic glass slides and a Coplin jar containing 95% ethyl
alcohol (as a fixative) are the only other material required
for routine FNAC.
Method of Aspiration
Transcutaneous FNAC of palpable masses is routinely per-
formed without anaesthesia as per the following procedure;
aspiration of sites/lesions requiring anaesthesia or special
technique are discussed separately (Fig. 11.11):
i)
The patient is asked to lie down in a position that best
exposes the target area.
Figure 11.10
Equipments required for transcutaneous FNAC.

279
CHAPTER 11
Basic Diagnostic Cytology
ii) The target area is thoroughly palpated and the firmest
portion of the lesion or mass delineated.
iii) The skin is cleaned with an alcohol pad.
iv) The mass is fixed by the palpating hand of the operator
or by an assistant; gloves may be used for protection of the
operator and the assistant.
v) The needle is inserted into the target area. On reaching
the lesion, the plunger of the syringe is retracted and at least
10 ml of suction applied while moving the needle back and
forth within the lesion; the direction or angle of the needle
may be changed to access different areas of the lesion.
vi) Aspiration is terminated when aspirated material or blood
becomes visible at the base or hub of the needle. For
diagnostic purposes, cellular material contained within the
needle is more than adequate; material drawn into the barrel
of the syringe is not recovered since it is of no use for cytologic
diagnosis.
vii) On completion of aspiration, suction is released and
pressure within the syringe allowed to equalise before
withdrawing the needle. Withdrawing the needle with
negative pressure or suction results in blood being aspirated
and cellular material being sucked into the barrel of the
syringe, thus lost to interpretation.
Figure 11.11
Procedure for FNAC of palpable masses. Needle is
introduced into the mass (A). Plunger is retracted after needle enters the
mass (B). Suction is maintained while needle is moved back and forth
within the mass (C). Suction is released and plunger returned to original
position before needle is withdrawn (D).
viii) Following withdrawal of the needle from the lesion,
pressure is applied to the site of puncture by the assistant or
patient himself for 2 to 3 minutes in order to arrest bleeding
and prevent haematoma formation.
ix) Aspirated material is recovered by detaching the needle
from the syringe and filling the syringe with air; the syringe
and needle are then reconnected and the aspirate expressed
onto one end of a glass slide.
Preparation of Smears
Preparation of smears is crucial to the success of FNAC.
Poorly-prepared smears with distorted cellular morphology
will frustrate the best efforts of the most competent
cytopathologist, and often result in errors of interpretation
or in failure to arrive at any specific diagnosis. The procedure
consists of the following steps (Fig. 11.12):
i)
Aspirates deposited on the slide are inspected with the
naked eye.
ii) Semisolid particulate aspirates are crush-smeared by flat
pressure with a glass slide or a thick coverslip. Even and
gentle pressure is required to avoid traumatising cells.
Droplets of fluid or bloody material are gathered under the
edge of the angled smearing slide or coverslip and pulled
like a blood smear. Particulate material, which collects along
the edges and at the end of the smear, is then crush-smeared
by flattening the smearing slide.
iii) Prepared smears are either wet-fixed or air-dried. Half the
number of smears are immediately immersed in 95% ethanol,
transported to the laboratory in the fixative, and used for
Papanicolaou or H&E staining. The remaining smears are
air-dried, wrapped in tissue paper for transport to the labo-
ratory, and stained by Romanowsky stains (e.g. Leishman’s,
May-Grünwald-Giemsa). Most cytopathologists use both
wet-fixed and air-dried smears—the wet-fixed smears
provide excellent nuclear detail while the air-dried smears
yields information about the cytoplasm and the background.
The general properties of wet-fixed and air-dried smears
outlined in Table 11.8.
Special and Ancillary Studies
Aspirates may also be studied by special stains and tech-
niques for specific purposes as under:
Figure 11.12
Preparation of smears. Semisolid aspirates are crush-smeared by flat pressure with cover slip or glass slide (A). Fluid or blood
droplet is collected along edge of spreader (B), and pulled as for peripheral blood films (C). Particles at the end of the smear are crush-smeared (D).

SECTION I
General Pathology and Basic Techniques
i)
SPECIAL STAINS. Wet-fixed smears are used for a
variety of special stains such as Alcian blue, mucicarmine
and PAS (for mucin and carbohydrates); methyl violet or
congo red (for amyloid); and bacterial and fungal stains (for
microbial agents).
ii) MICROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES. Aspirates may also be
submitted for viral, fungal, mycobacterial and bacterial
culture. When infection is suspected, an additional aspirate
is obtained and expressed into a sterile culture tube. If
additional aspiration is not feasible, the needle is flushed with
sterile isotonic saline or foetal calf serum and the rinsed fluid
submitted for microbial culture.
iii) CELL BLOCK. Aspirated material may be processed as
surgical pathology material by preparing paraffin blocks
from cell button of the centrifuged deposit. Sections provide
recognition of histologic patterns and can also be used for
ancillary techniques.
iv) IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL STUDIES. The smears or
cell block sections can be further evaluated by immuno-
cytochemical stains by employing panel of antibodies
selected on the basis of differential diagnosis made after
routine morphologic examination of smears.
v) IMAGE ANALYSIS AND MORPHOMETRY. These
techniques when applied to cytological smears bring
quantitation and objectivity to cytodiagnosis. They determine
the cellular parameters like N/C ratio, nuclear area, shape
and size of nuclei and nucleoli etc.
vi) FLOW CYTOMETRY. Determination of ploidy status and
S phase fraction of tumour cells using flow cytometry
enhances the diagnostic and prognostic information available
on routine cytology.
vii) ULTRASTRUCTURAL STUDIES. Aspirates obtained
by FNAC are also suitable for electron microscopy (both TEM
and SEM).
viii) MOLECULAR BIOLOGIC TECHNIQUES. These
techniques are now being widely applied to cytopathology
also. Detection of oncogenes like ERBB-2 in breast cancer,
BCL-2 in lymphomas, DNA sequence analysis, gene
expression profiling and fluorescence in situ hybridisation
(FISH) can all be used for aspiration samples.
Aspiration of Specific Lesions/Body Sites
In addition to the general procedure for FNAC described
above, aspiration from certain specific sites/lesions
require greater expertise and additional material as
outlined below.
i)
CYSTS. Cysts of the neck, thyroid, breast and other sites
are often encountered during FNAC. During aspiration, the
entire fluid content is evacuated by drawing into the syringe
and collected in test tube for centrifugation and smear
preparation. If a residual mass is palpable after removal of
fluid, a fresh syringe is used for additional aspiration of the
mass in the usual manner.
ii) THYROID. Lesions of the thyroid are aspirated with the
patient either sitting up or lying supine with the neck
extended. Solitary nodules are fixed between two palpating
fingers, while a diffusely enlarged lobe is fixed by asking
the patient to swallow and applying two fingers to the base
of the lobe to hold it against the trachea. The patient is asked
to avoid swallowing during aspiration. Subsequently, firm
pressure is applied to the puncture site for about 3 minutes
to prevent haematoma formation.
iii) LUNG AND RETROPERITONEUM. FNAC of these two
sites is usually carried out under the guidance of radiological
imaging techniques. Local anaesthesia (1% xylocaine) is
advisable with infiltration of skin and deeper tissues. Spinal
puncture needles (22 or 20 gauge) are used. Since these long
needles are flexible they are rotated during insertion to enable
an accurate approach to the target lesion.
iv) PROSTATE. The prostate is sampled transrectally during
per-rectal examination with the patient in lithotomy position.
A custom-made or commercially available needle guide (such
as the Franzen needle guide) may be used. Alternatively, a
16 gauge blunt-tipped venous cannula may serve as a needle
guide. The cannula is taped to the index finger of the gloved
hand with its tip just proximal to the pulp of the index-finger,
and a fingercot drawn over it. The prostatic lesion is palpated
with the pulp of the finger and sampled by puncturing
through the fingercot with a long 22 gauge needle introduced
through the cannula.
v) TESTIS. Local anaesthesia is advisable when FNAC of
the testis is carried out for infertility as pain may be
considerable when suction is applied. Spermatic cord block
is employed for the purpose. Infiltration of scrotal skin is
not required. For suspected testicular tumours, local
anaesthesia is not required; however, thinner needles (25 or
24 gauge) are advocated by some workers to avoid seeding
of tumour along the needle track.

Basic Diagnostic Cytology
vi) ABDOMINAL FAT ASPIRATION. FNA of the para-
umbilical abdominal adipose tissue is currently accepted
method for diagnosis of secondary systemic amyloidosis.
Amyloid is demonstrated as rings around fat cells by the
conventional Congo red staining (congophilia) and apple-
green birefringence when viewed under polarising
microscopy.
Radiological Imaging Aids for FNAC
Non-palpable lesions require some form of localisation by
radiological aids for FNAC to be carried out. Plain X-ray films
are usually adequate for lesions within bones and for some
lesions within the chest. FNAC of the chest may also be
attempted under image amplified fluoroscopy which allows
visualisation of needle placement on the television monitor.
Computerised tomographic-(CT) guidance is also used for lesions
within the chest and abdomen. The most versatile
radiological aid is ultrasonographic (US)-guidance which allows
direct visualisation of needle placement in real time and is
free from radiation hazards. It is an extremely valuable aid
for FNAC of thyroid nodules, soft tissue masses, intra-abdo-
minal lesions and for intrathoracic lesions which abut the
chest wall, but is of no help in deep intrathoracic lesions or
in bony lesions.
D. COMPLICATIONS AND HAZARDS OF FNAC
FNAC is associated with relatively few complications.
Possible hazards and more commonly encountered
complications are as follows:
1.
Haematomas. Bleeding from the puncture site and
haematoma formation are the commonest complications of
the procedure, particularly in the breast and the thyroid. Firm
finger pressure for 2 to 3 minutes immediately after the
procedure greatly reduces the frequency of these
complications.
2.
Infection. Introduction of infection is not a significant
hazard; even transabdominal aspiration does not result in
peritoneal contamination despite puncture of bowel walls.
Transrectal aspiration in cases of acute prostatitis may,
however, result in bacteraemia and septicaemia.
3.
Pneumothorax. Transcutaneous aspiration of the lung
causes pneumothorax in about 20% of cases; most resolve
spontaneously although intercostal intubation may be
required in some instances. Transient haemoptysis may also
be associated with lung aspiration.
4.
Dissemination of tumour. Generalised dissemination of
malignant cells via lymphatics and blood vessels following
FNAC is a theoretical possibility but no definite instances
have been recorded. Local dissemination by seeding of
malignant cells along the needle tract is a rare complication
and has been reported in cancers of the lung, prostate and
pancreas. Aspiration of malignant ovarian cysts may result
in release of cyst contents into the peritoneal cavity with
peritoneal implants.
E. PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS OF FNAC
While FNAC is generally a safe procedure, precautions have
to be taken when aspiration is contemplated of some sites
under certain circumstances:
1.
Bleeding disorders. Thrombocytopenia per se is not a
contraindication to FNAC. In patients with coagulopathies
such as haemophilia, aspiration of joint spaces, chest and
abdominal viscera is contraindicated; superficial lesions may
be aspirated and pressure applied to the puncture site for at
least 5 minutes following the procedure.
2.
Liver. Estimation of prothrombin time is an essential pre-
requisite for aspiration of the liver. FNAC is not advisable if
prothrombin index (PTI) is less than 80%. Obstructive
jaundice is a relative contraindication for FNAC on account
of the risk of bile peritonitis.
3.
Lung. FNAC of the lung should not be undertaken in
elderly patients with emphysema or pulmonary hyper-
tension because of the enhanced risk of pneumothorax and
haemoptysis respectively.
4.
Pancreas. FNAC is contraindicated in acute pancreatitis
as it aggravates the inflammatory process.
5.
Prostate. Transrectal aspiration in acute prostatitis may
cause bacteraemia/septicaemia and is contraindicated.
6.
Testis. Aspiration is extremely painful in acute
epididymo-orchitis and should be deferred till such time the
acute inflammatory process subsides. The patient is treated
with anti-inflammatory agents and antibiotics and FNAC
undertaken at a later date.
7.
Adrenal. FNAC of a suspected pheochromocytoma is
inadvisable as it may sometimes provoke extreme fluctua-
tions in blood pressure.
F. CYTOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS
The cytopathologist can render a preliminary diagnosis
within one hour after the FNAC procedure when urgently
required. Basic cytologic features in FNAC are similar to
those in histopathology but smear cytology depends upon
the technique for smear and stains employed. Emphasis in
FNA cytology is on pattern recognition or arrangement of
cells, nuclear and cytoplasmic features of individual cells or
groups of cells, and comment on the background
morphology.
Understandably, it is beyond the scope of this book to
delve into morphological details of various lesions which can
be sampled by FNAC; interested readers in this subject are
referred to the specialised texts listed at the end of the book.
However, a few common and classical examples of FNAC
applications in lymph node (tuberculous lymphadenitis,
Fig. 11.13), thyroid (follicular neoplasm, Fig. 11.14), breast
(fibroadenoma and infiltrating carcinoma, Figs. 11.15 and
11.16), abdominal fat (for amyloid, Fig. 11.17) and cell-block
preparation along with immunocytochemistry (Fig. 11.18)
are illustrated.

CHAPTER 11
Basic Diagnostic Cytology
G. LIMITATIONS OF FNAC
The main limitation of FNAC lies in the fact that only a small
population of cells is sampled by the procedure. The
reliability of the test, thus, depends upon the adequacy of
the sample and its representative character. An inadequate
sample which is not representative of the true lesion results
in a ‘false-negative’ diagnosis. If the FNAC report is
‘negative’ despite a strong clinical suspicion of malignancy,
the patient should be investigated further. FNAC may be
repeated or a surgical biopsy performed to obtain a tissue
diagnosis in such instances.
Lack of requisite clinical information (e.g. size, site and
character of mass) or relevant investigative results (e.g. X-
ray findings) further limit the utility of FNAC. Knowledge
of the exact site from where the aspirate has been obtained
is crucial to the accurate interpretation of FNAC smears and
lack of this information severely compromises the ability of
the cytopathologist to provide a diagnosis.
II. IMPRINT CYTOLOGY
In imprint cytology, touch preparations from cut surfaces of
fresh unfixed surgically excised mass lesions are examined.
Imprints may also be obtained from draining sinuses or
ulcerated areas.
For surgically resected specimens (e.g. lymph nodes)
smears are prepared by bisecting or slicing the specimen and
lightly touching or pressing a glass slide onto the freshly
exposed surface without smearing it. Smears cannot be
prepared from fixed specimens. Smears are wet-fixed or air-
dried and stained as per routine.
The main advantage of the imprint smear is that the cell
distribution reflects, and to some extent, recapitulates tissue
architecture thus aiding in interpretation. The technique is
used in the intraoperative diagnosis of malignancy as a
complement to frozen-section, and is also valuable as an
adjunct to histopathology in the typing of lymphomas.
III. CRUSH SMEAR CYTOLOGY
Crush smear preparations of tissue particles obtained by
craniotomy have been used in the diagnosis of brain tumours.
These smears are preferred by many workers as they allow
recognition of tissue architecture to some degree, in addition
to better cytological details.
IV. BIOPSY SEDIMENT CYTOLOGY
Biopsy sediment cytology entails the examination of
sediment obtained by centrifugation of fixatives/fluids in
which surgical biopsy specimens are despatched to the
laboratory. The method may be useful in the rapid diagnosis
of bone tumours as histological sections are usually obtained
after many days on account of the delay necessitated by
decalcification. For soft tissue specimens, the technique offers
no particular advantage.
In conclusion, both exfoliative cytology and FNA
cytology have now become a part of diagnostic pathology.
It is imperative for the student in pathology as well as the
clinician to be familiar with the advantages and limitations
of cytologic diagnosis. It is acknowledged that a marked
decline in incidence of cervical cancer in developed countries
is attributable to highly successful preventive Pap smear
screening programme. Similarly, large number of surgical
diagnostic procedures are now avoided by rational use of
FNAC. However, in view of unique responsibility of
pathologist in patient management, reporting cyto-
pathologist should be adequately trained in the skill and
should not hesitate to ask for ancillary diagnostic techniques,
or advise the use of core biopsy or open biopsy, wherever
appropriate.

SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
Introduction to Haematopoietic
System and Disorders of
Erythroid Series
Chapter 12
Chapter 12
The section on disorders of the haematopoietic system is
concerned with diseases of the blood and the bone marrow.
Conventionally, it includes study of constituents of
circulating blood and thus comprises of discussion on
diseases of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and
bleeding disorders, and an account of blood groups and
blood transfusion. However, with wide acceptance of the
newer WHO classification of malignancies of haematopoietic
system and lymphoreticular tissues over previous FAB
(French-American-British) Cooperative Group classification,
this section needed rational redistribution. While the FAB
group had taken the criteria of location of leucocytes (in blood
and in tissues) for classification, the WHO classification has
taken into consideration both ‘circulating’ leucocytes and
‘fixed’ leucocytes present anywhere in the tissues together
since these diseases tend to disseminate from one pool to
the other.
Thus, in this edition, the present chapter encompasses
basic introduction to the haematopoietic system and the bone
marrow, followed by discussion on erythroid series of
disorders. The disorders of leucocytes (myeloid and
lymphoid series) and diseases of lymphoreticular tissues
have been put together in Chapter 14. A separate chapter on
disorders of platelets and bleeding along with transfusion
medicine (Chapter 13) has been placed interposed between
these two chapters.
Since study of haematopoietic system involves two
phases—laboratory haematology and clinical haematology,
understanding of broad principles of management of
common haematological diseases has been considered
desirable part of the discussion on these topics.
BONE MARROW
The pluripotent stem cells in the bone marrow give rise to
two types of multipotent stem cells: non-lymphoid stem cells
which differentiate in the bone marrow, and lymphoid stem
cells which differentiate in the bone marrow and then migrate
to the lymphoid tissues. The non-lymphoid stem cells form
the circulating erythrocytes, granulocytes, monocytes and
platelets. Monocytes on entering the tissues form a variety
of phagocytic macrophages, both of which together constitute
mononuclear-phagocyte system (Chapter 4). Lymphopoietic
cells in the marrow undergo differentiation to form B, T and
natural killer (NK) cells of the immune system.
Circulating blood normally contains 3 main types of
mature cells—the red cells (erythrocytes), the white cells
(leucocytes) and the platelets (thrombocytes). These blood
cells perform their respective physiologic functions:
erythrocytes are largely concerned with oxygen transport,
leucocytes play various roles in body defense against infection
and tissue injury, while thrombocytes are primarily involved
in maintaining integrity of blood vessels and in preventing
blood loss. The lifespan of these cells in circulating blood is
variable—neutrophils have a lifespan of 6-8 hours, followed
by platelets with a lifepan of 10 days, while the RBCs have
the longest lifespan of 90-120 days. The rates of production
of these blood cells are normally regulated in healthy
individuals in such a way so as to match the rate at which
they are lost from circulation. Their concentration is normally
maintained within well-defined limits unless the balance is
disturbed due to some pathologic processes.
HAEMATOPOIESIS
In the human embryo, the yolk sac is the main site of
haematopoiesis in the first few weeks of gestation. By about
3rd month, however, the liver and spleen are the main sites of
blood cell formation and continue to do so until about 2 weeks
after birth. Haematopoiesis commences in the bone marrow
by 4th and 5th month and becomes fully active by 7th and
8th month so that at birth practically all the bones contain
active marrow. During normal childhood and adult life,
therefore, the marrow is the only source of new blood cells.
However, during childhood, there is progressive fatty
replacement throughout the long bones so that by adult life
the haematopoietic marrow is confined to the central skele-
ton (vertebrae, sternum, ribs, skull, sacrum and pelvis) and
proximal ends of femur, tibia and humerus (Fig. 12.1). Even
in these haematopoietic areas, about 50% of the marrow
consists of fat (Fig. 12.2). Non-haematopoietic marrow in the
adult is, however, capable of reverting to active haemato-

LYMPHORETICULAR TISSUES

Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series
poiesis in certain pathologic conditions. The spleen and liver
can also resume their foetal haematopoietic role in certain
pathologic conditions and is called extramedullary
haematopoiesis.
In the bone marrow, developing blood cells are situated
outside the marrow sinuses, from where after maturation
they enter the marrow sinuses, the marrow microcirculation
and thence released into circulation.
HAEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS
Haematopoieisis involves two stages: mitotic division or
proliferation, and differentiation or maturation.
It is widely accepted that blood cells develop from a small
population of common multipotent haematopoietic stem
cells. The stem cells express a variety of cell surface proteins
such as CD34 and adhesion proteins which help the stem
cells to “home” to the bone marrow when infused. The stem
cells have the appearance of small or intermediate-sized
lymphocytes and their presence in the marrow can be
demonstrated by cell culture techniques by the growth of
colony-forming units (CFU) pertaining to different cell lines.
The stem cells have the capability of maintaining their
progeny by self-replication. The bone marrow provides a
suitable environment for growth and development of stem
cells. For instance, if haematopoietic stem cells are infused
intravenously into a suitably-prepared recipient, they seed
the marrow successfully but do not thrive at other sites. This
principle forms the basis of bone marrow (or stem cell) trans-
plantation performed for various haematologic diseases.
The stem cells, after a series of divisions, differentiate into
two types of progenitors—lymphoid (immune system) stem
cells, and non-lymphoid or myeloid (trilineage) stem cells. The
former develop into T, B and NK cells while the latter
differentiate into 3 types of cell lines—granulocyte-monocyte
progenitors (producing neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils
and monocytes), erythroid progenitors (producing red cells),
and megakaryocytes (as the source of platelets). The develop-
ment of mature cells (i.e. poiesis)—red cells (erythropoiesis),
granulocytes (granulopoiesis), monocytes, lymphocytes
(lymphopoiesis) and platelets (thrombopoiesis) are
considered in detail later in relevant sections.
Myeloid haematopoiesis or myelopoiesis includes
differentiation and maturation of granulocytes, monocytes,
erythroid cells and megakaryocytes (Fig. 12.3). The
differentiation and maturation of each series of these cells
from stem cells are regulated by endogenous glycoproteins
called as growth factors, cytokines and hormones. These are as
under:
Erythropoietin
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)
Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-
CSF)
Thrombopoietin
Each of these growth factors acts on specific receptors
for growth factor to initiate further cell events as shown
schematically in Fig. 12.3.
BONE MARROW EXAMINATION
Examination of the bone marrow provides an invaluable
diagnostic help in some cases, while in others it is of value in
confirming a diagnosis suspected on clinical examination or
on the blood film. A peripheral blood smear examination,
however, must always precede bone marrow examination.
Figure 12.1

SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
Figure 12.3
Schematic representation of differentiation of multipotent stem cells into blood cells.
Bone marrow examination may be performed by two
methods—aspiration and trephine biopsy. A comparison of the
two methods is summarised in Table 12.1.
BONE MARROW ASPIRATION.  The method involves
suction of marrow via a strong, wide bore, short-bevelled
needle fitted with a stylet and an adjustable guard in order
to prevent excessive penetration; for instance Salah bone
marrow aspiration needle (Fig. 12.4,A).  Smears are prepared
immediately from the bone marrow aspirate and are fixed
in 95% methanol after air-drying. The usual Romanowsky
technique is employed for staining and a stain for iron is
performed routinely so as to assess the reticuloendothelial
stores of iron.
The marrow film provides assessment of cellularity,
details of developing blood cells (i.e. normoblastic or
megaloblastic, myeloid, lymphoid, macrophages and
megakaryocytic), ratio between erythroid and myeloid cells,
storage diseases, and for the presence of cells foreign to the
marrow such as secondary carcinoma, granulomatous
conditions, fungi (e.g. histoplasmosis) and parasites (e.g.
malaria, leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis). Estimation of the
proportion of cellular components in the marrow, however,
can be provided by doing a differential count of at least 500
cells (myelogram, Table 12.2). In some conditions, the
marrow cells can be used for more detailed special tests such
as cytogenetics, microbiological culture, biochemical
analysis, and immunological and cytological markers.
TREPHINE BIOPSY. Trephine biopsy is performed by a
simple Jamshidi trephine needle by which a core of tissue from
periosteum to bone marrow cavity is obtained (Fig. 12.4,B).
The tissue is then fixed, soft decalcified and processed for
histological sections and stained with haematoxylin and
eosin and for reticulin. Trephine biospy is useful over
aspiration since it provides an excellent view of the overall
marrow architecture, cellularity, and presence or absence of
infiltrates, but is less valuable than aspiration as far as
individual cell morphology is concerned.

287
CHAPTER 12
Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series
RED BLOOD CELLS
ERYTHROPOIESIS
Although the stem cells which eventually form the mature
erythrocytes of the peripheral blood cannot be recognised
morphologically, there is a well-defined and readily
recognisable lineage of nucleated red cells (i.e. the erythroid
series) in the marrow.
Erythroid Series
The cells in this series are as under (Fig. 12.5):
1.
PROERYTHROBLAST. The earliest recognisable cell in
the marrow is a proerythroblast or pronormoblast. It is a large
cell, 15-20 μm in diameter having deeply basophilic
cytoplasm and a large central nucleus containing nucleoli.
The deep blue colour of the cytoplasm is due to high content
of RNA which is associated with active protein synthesis.
As the cells mature, the nuclei lose their nucleoli and become
smaller and denser, while the cytoplasm on maturation leads
to replacement of dense blue colour progressively by pink-
staining haemoglobin. Each proerythroblast undergoes 4-5
replications and forms 16-32 mature RBCs.
2.
BASOPHILIC (EARLY) ERYTHROBLAST. It is a round
cell having a diameter of 12-16 μm with a large nucleus which
is slightly more condensed than the proerythroblast and
contains basophilic cytoplasm. Basophilic erythroblast
undergoes rapid proliferation.
3.
POLYCHROMATIC(INTERMEDIATE) ERYTHRO-
BLAST. Next maturation stage has a diameter of 12-14 μm.
The nucleus at this stage is coarse and deeply basophilic.
The cytoplasm is characteristically polychromatic i.e.
contains admixture of basophilic RNA and acidophilic
haemoglobin. The cell at this stage ceases to undergo
proliferative activity.
4.
ORTHOCHROMATIC (LATE) ERYTHROBLAST.  The
final stage in the maturation of nucleated red cells is the
orthochromatic or late erythroblast. The cell at this stage is
smaller, 8-12 μm in diameter, containing a small and pyknotic

nucleus with dark nuclear chromatin. The cytoplasm is
characteristically acidophilic with diffuse basophilic hue due
to the presence of large amounts of haemoglobin.
5.
RETICULOCYTE. The nucleus is finally extruded from
the late erythroblast within the marrow and a reticulocyte
results. The reticulocytes are juvenile red cells devoid of
nuclei but contain ribosomal RNA so that they are still able
to synthesise haemoglobin. A reticulocyte spends 1-2 days
in the marrow and circulates for 1-2 days in the peripheral
blood before maturing in the spleen, to become a biconcave
red cell. The reticulocytes in the peripheral blood are distin-
guished from mature red cells by slightly basophilic hue in
the cytoplasm similar to that of an orthochromatic
erythroblast. Reticulocytes can be counted in the laboratory
by vital staining with dyes such as new methylene blue or
brilliant cresyl blue. The reticulocytes by either of these
staining methods contain deep blue reticulofilamentous
material (Fig. 12.6). While erythroblasts are not normally
present in human peripheral blood, reticulocytes are found
normally in the peripheral blood. Normal range of
reticulocyte count in health is 0.5-2.5% in adults and 2-6% in
infants. Their percentage in the peripheral blood is a fairly
accurate reflection of erythropoietic activity. Their proportion
is increased in conditions of rapid red cell regeneration e.g.
after haemorrhage, haemolysis and haematopoietic response
of anaemia to treatment.
Erythropoietin
Erythropoietic activity in the body is regulated by the
hormone, erythropoietin, which is produced in response to
anoxia. The principal site of erythropoietin production is the
kidney though there is evidence of its extra-renal production
in certain unusual circumstances. Its levels are, therefore,
lowered in chronic renal diseases, while a case of renal cell
carcinoma may be associated with its increased production
and erythrocytosis. Erythropoietin acts on the marrow at the
various stages of morphologically unidentifiable as well as
identifiable erythroid precursors.
There is an increased production of erythropoietin in
various types of anaemias but in anaemia of chronic diseases
(e.g. in infections and neoplastic conditions) there is no such
enhancement of erythropoietin. In polycythaemia rubra vera,
there is erythrocytosis but depressed production of
erythropoietin. This is because of an abnormality of the stem
cell class which is not under erythropoietin control.
Immunoassay of erythropoietin in plasma or serum can
be done by sensitive techniques (ELISA and radio-
immunoassay) due to its quite low values; normal values
are 10-25 U/L.
The Red Cell
The mature erythrocytes of the human peripheral blood are
non-nucleated cells and lack the usual cell organelles. The
normal human erythrocyte is a biconcave disc, 7.2 μm in
diameter, and has a thickness of 2.4 μm at the periphery and
1 μm in the centre. The biconcave shape renders the red cells
quite flexible so that they can pass through capillaries whose
minimum diameter is 3.5 μm. More than 90% of the weight
of erythrocyte consist of haemoglobin. The lifespan of red
cells is 120 + 30 days.
NORMAL VALUES AND RED CELL INDICES.  Range of
normal red cell count in health is 5.5 ± 1.0 × 1012/L in men
and 4.8 ± 1.0 × 1012/L in women. The packed cell volume (PCV)
or haematocrit is the volume of erythrocytes per litre of whole
blood indicating the proportion of plasma and red cells and
ranges 0.47 ± 0.07 L/L (40-54%) in men and 0.42 ± 0.05 L/L
(37-47%) in women. The haemoglobin content in health is 15.5
± 2.5 g/dl (13-18 g/dl) in men and 14.0 ± 2.5 g/dl (11.5-16.5
g/dl) in women. Based on these normal values, a series of
absolute values or red cell indices can be derived which have
diagnostic importance. These are as under:
Figure 12.5
The erythroid series. There is progressive condensation of the nuclear chromatin which is eventually extruded from the cell at the
late erythroblast stage. The cytoplasm contains progressively less RNA and more haemoglobin.

_________________

The normal value is 32.5 ± 2.5 g/dl (30-35 g/dl).
Since MCHC is independent of red cell count and size, it
is considered to be of greater clinical significance as compared
to other absolute values. It is low in iron deficiency anaemia
but is usually normal in acrostic anaemia.
RED CELL MEMBRANE. The red cell membrane is a
trilaminar structure having a bimolecular lipid layer
interposed between two layers of proteins. The important
proteins in red cell membrane are band 3 protein (named on
the basis of the order in which it migrates during
electrophoresis), glycophorin and spectrin; important lipids
are glycolipids, phospholipids and cholesterol; and
carbohydrates form skeleton of erythrocytes having a lattice-
like network which is attached to the internal surface of the
membrane and is responsible for biconcave form of the
erythrocytes.
A number of inherited disorders of the red cell membrane
and cytoskeletal components produce abnormalities of the
shape such as: spherocytosis (spherical shape from loss of part
of the membrane), ovalocytosis (oval shape from loss of
elasticity of cytoskeleton), echinocytosis (spiny processes from
external surface due to metabolic abnormalities of red cells),
and stomatocytosis (bowl-shaped red cells from expansion of
inner membrane on one side).
NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ERYTHRO-
POIESIS. New red cells are being produced each day for
which the marrow requires certain essential substances.
These substances are as under:
1.
Metals. Iron is essential for red cell production because
it forms part of the haem molecule in haemoglobin. Its
deficiency leads to iron deficiency anaemia. Cobalt and
manganese are certain other metals required for red cell
production.
2.
Vitamins. Vitamin B12 and folate are essential for bio-
synthesis of nucleic acids. Deficiency of B12 or folate causes
megaloblastic anaemia. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) plays an
indirect role by facilitating the iron turnover in the body.
Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin E (tocopherol) and
riboflavin are the other essential vitamins required in the
synthesis of red cells.
3.
Amino acids. Amino acids comprise the globin compo-
nent of haemoglobin. Severe amino acid deficiency due to
protein deprivation causes depressed red cell production.
4.
Hormones. As discussed above, erythropoietin plays a
significant regulatory role in the erythropoietic activity.
Besides erythropoietin, androgens and thyroxine also appear
to be involved in the red cell production.
HAEMOGLOBIN. Haemoglobin consists of a basic protein,
globin, and the iron-porphyrin complex, haem. The molecular
weight of haemoglobin is 68,000. Normal adult haemoglobin
(HbA) constitutes 96-98% of the total haemoglobin content
and consists of four polypeptide chains, α2β2. Small quantities
of 2 other haemoglobins present in adults are: HbF containing
α2γ2 globin chains comprising 0.5-0.8% of total haemoglobin,
and HbA2 having α2δ2 chains and constituting 1.5-3.2% of
total haemoglobin. Most of the haemoglobin (65%) is
synthesised by the nucleated red cell precursors in the
marrow, while the remainder (35%) is synthesised at the
reticulocyte stage.
Synthesis of haem occurs largely in the mitochondria by
a series of biochemical reactions summarised in Fig. 12.7.
Coenzyme, pyridoxal-6-phosphate, derived from pyridoxine
(vitamin B6) is essential for the synthesis of amino levulinic
acid (ALA) which is the first step in the biosynthesis of
protoporphyrin. The reaction is stimulated by erythropoietin
and inhibited by haem. Ultimately, protoporphyrin combines
with iron supplied from circulating transferrin to form haem.
Each molecule of haem combines with a globin chain
synthesised by polyribosomes. A tetramer of 4 globin chains,
each having its own haem group, constitutes the
haemoglobin molecule (Fig. 12.8, A).
RED CELL  FUNCTIONS. The essential function of the red
cells is to carry oxygen from the lungs to the tissue and to
transport carbon dioxide to the lungs. In order to perform
these functions, the red cells have the ability to generate
energy as ATP by anaerobic glycolytic pathway (Embden-
Meyerhof pathway). This pathway also generates reducing
power as NADH and NADPH by the hexose monophosphate
(HMP) shunt.
1.
Oxygen carrying.  The normal adult haemoglobin, HbA,
is an extremely efficient oxygen-carrier. The four units of
tetramer of haemoglobin molecule take up oxygen in
succession, which, in turn, results in stepwise rise in affinity
of haemoglobin for oxygen. This is responsible for the sigmoid
shape of the oxygen dissociation curve.
The oxygen affinity of haemoglobin is expressed in term
of P50 value which is the oxygen tension (pO2) at which 50%
of the haemoglobin is saturated with oxygen. Pulmonary
capillaries have high pO2 and, thus, there is virtual saturation
of available oxygen-combining sites of haemoglobin. The
tissue capillaries, however, have relatively low pO2 and, thus,
part of haemoglobin is in deoxy state. The extent to which
oxygen is released from haemoglobin at pO2, in tissue
capillaries depends upon 3 factors—the nature of globin
*For conversions, the multiples used are as follows: ‘deci (d) = 10–1, milli
(m) = 10–3, micro (μ) = 10–6, nano (n) = 10–9, pico (p) = 10–12, femto (f) =
10–15

Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
chains, the pH, and the concentration of 2,3-
biphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) as follows (Fig 12.8, B):
Normal adult haemoglobin (HbA) has lower affinity for
oxygen than foetal haemoglobin and, therefore, releases
greater amount of bound oxygen at pO2 of tissue capillaries.
A fall in the pH (acidic pH) lowers affinity of
oxyhaemoglobin for oxygen, so called the Bohr effect, thereby
causing enhanced release of oxygen from erythrocytes at the
lower pH in tissue capillaries.
A rise in red cell concentration of 2,3-BPG, an intermediate
product of Embden-Meyerhof pathway, as occurs in anaemia
and hypoxia, causes decreased affinity of HbA for oxygen.
This, in turn, results in enhanced supply of oxygen to the
tissue.
2.
CO2 transport. Another important function of the red cells
is the CO2 transport. In the tissue capillaries, the pCO2 is
high so that CO2 enters the erythrocytes where much of it is
converted into bicarbonate ions which diffuse back into the
plasma. In the pulmonary capillaries, the process is reversed
and bicarbonate ions are converted back into CO2. Some of
the CO2 produced by tissues is bound to deoxyhaemoglobin
forming carbamino-haemoglobin. This compound dissociates
in the pulmonary capillaries to release CO2.
RED CELL DESTRUCTION. Red cells have a mean lifespan
of 120 days, after which red cell metabolism gradually
deteriorates as the enzymes are not replaced. The destroyed
red cells are removed mainly by the macrophages of the
reticuloendothelial (RE) system of the marrow, and to some

salt bridges are broken, and 2,3-BPG and CO2 are expelled. B, Hb-dissociation curve. On dissociation of oxygen from Hb molecule i.e. on release
of oxygen to the tissues, salt bridges are formed again, and 2,3-BPG and CO2, are bound. The shift of the curve to higher oxygen delivery is affected
by acidic pH, increased 2,3-BPG and HbA molecule while oxygen delivery is less with high pH, low 2,3-BPG and HbF.

extent by the macrophages in the liver and spleen (Fig.12.9).
The breakdown of red cells liberates iron for recirculation
via plasma transferrin to marrow erythroblasts, and
protoporphyrin which is broken down to bilirubin. Bilirubin
circulates to the liver where it is conjugated to its
diglucuronide which is excreted in the gut via bile and
converted to stercobilinogen and stercobilin excreted in the
faeces. Part of stercobilinogen and stercobilin is reabsorbed
and excreted in the urine as urobilinogen and urobilin. A
small fragment of protoporphyrin is converted to carbon
monoxide and excreted in expired air from the lungs. Globin
chains are broken down to amino acids and reused for protein
synthesis in the body.
ANAEMIA—GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
Anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin concentration in blood
below the lower limit of the normal range for the age and
sex of the individual. In adults, the lower extreme of the
normal haemoglobin is taken as 13.0 g/dl for males and
11.5 g/dl for females. Newborn infants have higher
haemoglobin level and, therefore, 15 g/dl is taken as the
lower limit at birth, whereas at 3 months the normal lower
level is 9.5 g/dl. Although haemoglobin value is employed
as the major parameter for determining whether or not
anaemia is present, the red cell counts, haematocrit (PCV)
and absolute values (MCV, MCH and MCHC) provide
alternate means of assessing anaemia.
Pathophysiology of Anaemia
Subnormal level of haemoglobin causes lowered oxygen-
carrying capacity of the blood. This, in turn, initiates
compensatory physiologic adaptations such as follows:
increased release of oxygen from haemoglobin;
increased blood flow to the tissues;
maintenance of the blood volume; and
redistribution of blood flow to maintain the cerebral blood
supply.
Eventually, however, tissue hypoxia develops causing
impaired functions of the affected tissues. The degree of
functional impairment of individual tissues is variable
depending upon their oxygen requirements. Tissues with
high oxygen requirement such as the heart, CNS and the
skeletal muscle during exercise, bear the brunt of clinical
effects of anaemia.
Clinical Features of Anaemia
The haemoglobin level at which symptoms and signs of
anaemia develop depends upon 4 main factors:
1.
The speed of onset of anaemia: Rapidly progressive anaemia
causes more symptoms than anaemia of slow-onset as there
is less time for physiologic adaptation.
2.
The severity of anaemia: Mild anaemia produces no
symptoms or signs but a rapidly developing severe anaemia
(haemoglobin below 6.0 g/dl) may produce significant
clinical features.
3.
The age of the patient: The young patients due to good
cardiovascular compensation tolerate anaemia quite well as
compared to the elderly. The elderly patients develop cardiac
and cerebral symptoms more prominently due to associated
cardiovascular disease.
4.
The haemoglobin dissociation curve: In anaemia, the affinity
of haemoglobin for oxygen is depressed as 2,3-BPG in the
red cells increases. As a result, oxyhaemoglobin is dissociated
more readily to release free oxygen for cellular use, causing
a shift of the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve to the right.
SYMPTOMS. In symptomatic cases of anaemia, the
presenting features are: tiredness, easy fatiguability,
generalised muscular weakness, lethargy and headache. In
older patients, there may be symptoms of cardiac failure,
angina pectoris, intermittent claudication, confusion and
visual disturbances.
SIGNS. A few general signs common to all types of anaemias
are as under:
Figure 12.9
Normal red cell destruction in the RE system.

292
SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
1.
Pallor. Pallor is the most common and characteristic sign
which may be seen in the mucous membranes, conjunctivae
and skin.
2.
Cardiovascular system. A hyperdynamic circulation may
be present with tachycardia, collapsing pulse, cardiomegaly,
midsystolic flow murmur, dyspnoea on exertion, and in the
case of elderly, congestive heart failure.
3.
Central nervous system. The older patients may develop
symptoms referable to the CNS such as attacks of faintness,
giddiness, headache, tinnitus, drowsiness, numbness and
tingling sensations of the hands and feet.
4.
Ocular manifestations. Retinal haemorrhages may occur
if there is associated vascular disease or bleeding diathesis.
5.
Reproductivesystem. Menstrual disturbances such as
amenorrhoea and menorrhagia and loss of libido are some
of the manifestations involving the reproductive system in
anaemic subjects.
6.
Renal system. Mild proteinuria and impaired concen-
trating capacity of the kidney may occur in severe anaemia.
7.
Gastrointestinalsystem. Anorexia, flatulence, nausea,
constipation and weight loss may occur.
In addition to the general features, specific signs may be
associated with particular types of anaemia which are
described later together with discussion of specific types of
anaemias.
Investigations of the Anaemic Subject
After obtaining the full medical history pertaining to different
general and specific signs and symptoms, the patient is
examined for evidence of anaemia. Special emphasis is placed
on colour of the skin, conjunctivae, sclerae and nails. Changes
in the retina, atrophy of the papillae of the tongue, rectal
examination for evidence of bleeding, and presence of
hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and bony
tenderness are looked for.
In order to confirm or deny the presence of anaemia, its
type and its cause, the following plan of investigations is
generally followed, of which complete blood counts (CBC)
with reticulocyte count is the basic test.
A. HAEMOGLOBIN ESTIMATION. The first and foremost
investigation in any suspected case of anaemia is to carry
out a haemoglobin estimation. Several methods are available
but most reliable and accurate is the cyanmethaemoglobin
(HiCN) method employing Drabkin’s solution and a
spectrophotometer. If the haemoglobin value is below the
lower limit of the normal range for particular age and sex,
the patient is said to be anaemic. In pregnancy, there is
haemodilution and, therefore, the lower limit in normal
pregnant women is less (10.5 g/dl) than in the non-pregnant
state.
B. PERIPHERAL BLOOD FILM EXAMINATION.  The
haemoglobin estimation is invariably followed by
examination of a peripheral blood film for morphologic
features after staining it with the Romanowsky dyes (e.g.
Leishman’s stain, May-Grünwald-Giemsa’s stain, Jenner-
Giemsa’s stain, Wright’s stain etc). The blood smear is
evaluated in an area where there is neither Rouleaux
formation nor so thin as to cause red cell distortion. Such an
area can usually be found at junction of the body with the
tail of the film, but not actually at the tail. The following
abnormalities in erythroid series of cells are particularly
looked for in a blood smear:
1.
Variation in size (Anisocytosis). Normally, there is slight
variation in diameter of the red cells from 6.7-7.7 μm (mean
value 7.2 μm). Increased variation in size of the red cell is
termed anisocytosis. Anisocytosis may be due to the presence
of cells larger than normal (macrocytosis) or cells smaller than
normal (microcytosis). Sometimes both microcytosis and
macrocytosis are present (dimorphic).
Macrocytes are classically found in megaloblastic anaemia;
other causes are aplastic anaemia, other dyserythropoietic
anaemias, chronic liver disease and in conditions with
increased erythropoiesis.
Microcytes are present in iron deficiency anaemia,
thalassaemia and spherocytosis. They may also result from
fragmentation of erythrocytes such as in haemolytic anaemia.
2.
Variation in shape (Poikilocytosis). Increased variation
in shape of the red cells is termed poikilocytosis. The nature
of the abnormal shape determines the cause of anaemia.
Poikilocytes are produced in various types of abnormal
erythropoiesis e.g. in megaloblastic anaemia, iron deficiency
anaemia, thalassaemia, myelosclerosis and microangiopathic
haemolytic anaemia.
3.
Inadequate haemoglobin formation (Hypochromasia).
Normally, the intensity of pink staining of haemoglobin in a
Romanowsky-stained blood smear gradually decreases from
the periphery to the centre of the cell. Increased central pallor
is referred to as hypochromasia. It may develop either from
lowered haemoglobin content (e.g. in iron deficiency
anaemia, chronic infections), or due to thinness of the red
cells (e.g. in thalassaemia, sideroblastic anaemia). Unusually
deep pink staining of the red cells due to increased haemo-
globin concentration is termed hyperchromasia and may be
found in megaloblastic anaemia, spherocytosis and in
neonatal blood.
4.
Compensatory erythropoiesis. A number of changes are
associated with compensatory increase in erythropoietic
activity. These are as under:
i)
Polychromasia is defined as the red cells having more than
one type of colour. Polychromatic red cells are slightly larger,
generally stained bluish-grey and represent reticulocytes and,
thus, correlate well with reticulocyte count.
ii) Erythroblastaemia is the presence of nucleated red cells in
the peripheral blood film. A small number of erythroblasts
(or normoblasts) may be normally found in cord blood at
birth. They are found in large numbers in haemolytic disease
of the newborn, other haemolytic disorders and in
extramedullary erythropoiesis. They may also appear in the
blood in various types of severe anaemias except in aplastic
anaemia. Erythroblastaemia may also occur after
splenectomy.
iii) Punctate basophilia or basophilic stippling is diffuse and
uniform basophilic granularity in the cell which does not
stain positively with Perls’ reaction (in contrast to

293
CHAPTER 12
Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series
Pappenheimer bodies which stain positively). Classical
punctate basophilia is seen in aplastic anaemia, thalassaemia,
myelodysplasia, infections and lead poisoning.
iv) Howell-Jolly bodies are purple nuclear remnants, usually
found singly, and are larger than basophilic stippling. They
are present in megaloblastic anaemia and after splenectomy.
5.
Miscellaneous changes. In addition to the morphologic
changes of red cells described above, several other abnormal
red cells may be found in different haematological disorders.
Some of these are as follows (Fig. 12.10):
i)
Spherocytosis is characterised by presence of spheroidal
rather than biconcave disc-shaped red cells. Spherocytes are
seen in hereditary spherocytosis, autoimmune haemolytic
anaemia and in ABO haemolytic disease of the newborn.
ii) Schistocytosis is identified by fragmentation of erythro-
cytes. Schistocytes are found in thalassaemia, hereditary
elliptocytosis, megaloblastic anaemia, iron deficiency
anaemia, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and in
severe burns.
iii) Irregularly contracted red cells are found in drug and
chemical induced haemolytic anaemia and in unstable
haemoglobinopathies.
iv) Leptocytosis is the presence of unusually thin red cells.
Leptocytes are seen in severe iron deficiency and
thalassaemia. Target cell is a form of leptocyte in which there
is central round stained area and a peripheral rim of
haemoglobin. Target cells are found in iron deficiency,
thalassaemia, chronic liver disease, and after splenectomy.
v) Sickle cells or drepanocytes are sickle-shaped red cells found
in sickle cell disease.
vi) Crenated red cells are the erythrocytes which develop
numerous projections from the surface. They are present in
blood films due to alkaline pH, presence of traces of fatty
substances on the slides and in cases where the film is made
from blood that has been allowed to stand overnight.
vii)  Acanthocytosis is the presence of coarsely crenated red
cells. Acanthocytes are found in large number in blood film
made from splenectomised subjects, and in chronic liver
disease.
viii) Burr cells are cell fragments having one or more spines.
They are particularly found in uraemia.
ix) Stomatocytosis is the presence of stomatocytes which have
central area having slit-like or mouth-like appearance. They
are found in hereditary stomatocytosis, or may be seen in
chronic alcoholism.
x) Ovalocytosis or elliptocytosis is the oval or elliptical shape
of red cells. Their highest proportion (79%) is seen in
hereditary ovalocytosis and elliptocytosis; other conditions
showing such abnormal shapes of red cells are megaloblastic
anaemia and hypochromic anaemia.
C. RED CELL INDICES.  An alternative method to diagnose
and detect the severity of anaemia is by measuring the red
cell indices:
In iron deficiency and thalassaemia, MCV, MCH and
MCHC are reduced.
In anaemia due to acute blood loss and haemolytic
anaemias, MCV, MCH and MCHC are all within normal
limits.
In megaloblastic anaemias, MCV is raised above the
normal range.
D. LEUCOCYTE AND PLATELET COUNT.  Measurement
of leucocyte and platelet count helps to distinguish pure
anaemia from pancytopenia in which red cells, granulocytes
and platelets are all reduced. In anaemias due to haemolysis
or haemorrhage, the neutrophil count and platelet counts
are often elevated. In infections and leukaemias, the leucocyte
counts are high and immature leucocytes appear in the blood.
E. RETICULOCYTE COUNT. Reticulocyte count (normal
0.5-2.5%) is done in each case of anaemia to assess the marrow
Figure 12.10
Some of the common morphologic abnormalities of red cells (The serial numbers in the illustrations correspond to the order in
which they are described in the text).

erythropoietic activity. In acute haemorrhage and in
haemolysis, the reticulocyte response is indicative of
impaired marrow function.
F. ERYTHROCYTE SEDIMENTATION RATE. The ESR
is a non-specific test used as a screening test for anaemia. It
usually gives a clue to the underlying organic disease but
anaemia itself may also cause rise in the ESR.
G. BONE MARROW EXAMINATION. Bone marrow
aspiration is done in cases where the cause for anaemia is
not obvious. The procedures involved for marrow aspiration
and trephine biopsy and their relative advantages and
disadvantages have already been discussed (page 285).
In addition to these general tests, certain specific tests
are done in different types of anaemias which are described
later under the discussion of specific anaemias.
Classification of Anaemias
Several types of classifications of anaemias have been
proposed. Two of the widely accepted classifications are
based on the pathophysiology and morphology (Table 12.3).
PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION. Depending
upon the pathophysiologic mechanism, anaemias are
classified into 3 groups:
I.
Anaemia due to blood loss. This is further of 2 types:
A. Acute post-haemorrhagic anaemia
B. Anaemia of chronic blood loss
II. Anaemia due to impaired red cell formation. A
disturbance due to impaired red cell production from various
causes may produce anaemia. These are as under:
A. Cytoplasmic maturation defects
1.
Deficient haem synthesis: iron deficiency anaemia
2.
Deficient globin synthesis: thalassaemic syndromes
B. Nuclear maturation defects
Vitamin B12 and/or folic acid deficiency: megalo-
blastic anaemia
C. Haematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation
abnormality e.g.
1.
Aplastic anaemia
2.
Pure red cell aplasia
D. Bone marrow failure due to systemic diseases (anaemia of
chronic disorders) e.g.
1. Anaemia of inflammation/infections, disseminated

The term hypoproliferative anaemias is also used to denote
impaired  marrow proliferative activity and includes 2 main
groups: hypoproliferation due to iron deficiency and that due
to other hypoproliferative disorders; the latter category
includes anaemia of chronic inflammation/infection, renal
disease, hypometabolic states, and causes of bone marrow
failure.
III. Anaemia due to increased red cell destruction (haemo-
lytic anaemias). This is further divided into 2 groups:
A. Intracorpuscular defect (hereditary and acquired).
B. Extracorpuscular defect (acquired haemolytic anaemias).
MORPHOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION.  Based on the red cell
size, haemoglobin content and red cell indices, anaemias are
classified into 3 types:
1.
Microcytic, hypochromic: MCV, MCH, MCHC are all
reduced e.g. in iron deficiency anaemia and in certain non-
iron deficient anaemias (sideroblastic anaemia, thalassaemia,
anaemia of chronic disorders).
2.
Normocytic, normochromic: MCV, MCH, MCHC are all
normal e.g. after acute blood loss, haemolytic anaemias, bone
marrow failure, anaemia of chronic disorders.
3.
Macrocytic: MCV is raised e.g. in megaloblastic anaemia
due to deficiency of vitamin B12 or folic acid.
With these general comments on anaemias, a discussion
of the specific types of anaemias is given in the following
pages.

ACUTE BLOOD LOSS.  When the loss of blood occurs
suddenly, the following events take place:
i)
Immediate threat to life due to hypovolaemia which may
result in shock and death.
ii) If the patient survives, shifting of interstitial fluid to
intravascular compartment with consequent haemodilution
with low haematocrit.
iii) Hypoxia stimulates production of erythropoietin resul-
ting in increased marrow erythropoiesis.
LABORATORY FINDINGS
i) Normocytic and normochromic anaemia
ii) Low haematocrit
iii) Increased reticulocyte count in peripheral blood
(10-15% after one week) reflecting accelerated marrow
erythropoiesis.
CHRONIC BLOOD LOSS. When the loss of blood is slow
and insidious, the effects of anaemia will become apparent
only when the rate of loss is more than rate of production
and the iron stores are depleted. This results in iron deficiency
anaemia as seen in other clinical conditions discussed below.
HYPOCHROMIC ANAEMIA
Hypochromic anaemia due to iron deficiency is the
commonest cause of anaemia the world over. It is estimated
that about 20% of women in child-bearing age group are iron
deficient, while the overall prevalence in adult males is about
2%. It is the most important, though not the sole, cause of
microcytic hypochromic anaemia in which all the three red
cell indices (MCV, MCH and MCHC) are reduced and occurs
due to defective haemoglobin synthesis. Hypochromic
anaemias, therefore, are classified into 2 groups:
I.
Hypochromic anaemia due to iron deficiency.
II. Hypochromic anaemias other than iron deficiency.
The latter category includes 3 groups of disorders—
sideroblastic anaemia, thalassaemia and anaemia of chronic
disorders.
IRON DEFICIENCY ANAEMIA
The commonest nutritional deficiency disorder present
throughout the world is iron deficiency but its prevalence is
higher in the developing countries. The factors responsible
for iron deficiency in different populations are variable and
are best understood in the context of normal iron metabolism.
Iron Metabolism
The amount of iron obtained from the diet should replace
the losses from the skin, bowel and genitourinary tract. These
losses together are about 1 mg daily in an adult male or in a
non-menstruating female, while in a menstruating woman
there is an additional iron loss of 0.5-1 mg daily. The iron
required for haemoglobin synthesis is derived from 2 primary
sources—ingestion of foods containing iron (e.g. leafy
vegetables, beans, meats, liver etc) and recycling of iron from
senescent red cells (Fig. 12.11).
ABSORPTION. The average Western diet contains 10-15 mg
of iron, out of which only 5-10% is normally absorbed. In
pregnancy and in iron deficiency, the proportion of
absorption is raised to 20-30%. Iron is absorbed mainly in
the duodenum and proximal jejunum. Iron from diet containing
haem is better absorbed than non-haem iron. Absorption of non-
haem iron is enhanced by factors such as ascorbic acid
(vitamin C), citric acid, amino acids, sugars, gastric secretions
and hydrochloric acid. Iron absorption is impaired by factors
like medicinal antacids, milk, pancreatic secretions, phytates,
phosphates, ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) and
tannates contained in tea.
Non-haem iron is released as ferrous or ferric form but
is absorbed almost exclusively as ferrous form; reduction of
ferric to ferrous form when required takes place at the
intestinal brush border  by  ferric reductase. Transport across
the membrane is accomplished by divalent metal trans-
porter 1 (DMT 1). Once inside the gut cells, ferric iron may
be either stored as ferritin or further transported to transferrin
by two vehicle proteins—ferroportin and hephaestin. The
mechanism of dietary haem iron absorption is not clearly
understood yet but it is through a different transport than
DMT 1. After absorption of both non-haem and haem forms
of iron, it comes into mucosal pool.
Major mechanism of maintaining iron balance in the body
is by intestinal absorption of dietary iron. When the demand
for iron is increased (e.g. during pregnancy, menstruation,
periods of growth and various diseases), there is increased
iron absorption, while excessive body stores of iron cause
reduced intestinal iron absorption (Fig. 12.12,A page 297).
TRANSPORT. Iron is transported in plasma bound to a
β-globulin, transferrin, synthesised in the liver. Transferrin-
bound iron is made available to the marrow where the
developing erythroid cells having transferring receptors utilise
iron for haemoglobin synthesis. It may be mentioned here
that tranferrin receptors are present on cells of many tissues
of the body but their number is greatest in the developing
erythroblasts. Transferrin is reutilised after iron is released
from it. A small amount of transferrin iron is delivered to
other sites such as parenchymal cells of the liver. Normally,
transferrin is about one-third saturated. But in conditions
where transferrin-iron saturation is increased, parenchymal
iron uptake is increased. Virtually, no iron is deposited in
the mononuclear-phagocyte cells (RE cells) from the plasma
transferrin-iron but instead these cells derive most of their
iron from phagocytosis of senescent red cells. Storage form
of iron (ferritin and haemosiderin) in RE cells is normally
not functional but can be readily mobilised in response to
increased demands for erythropoiesis. However, conditions
such as malignancy, infection and inflammation interfere
with the release of iron from iron stores causing ineffective
erythropoiesis.
EXCRETION. The body is unable to regulate its iron content
by excretion alone. The amount of iron lost per day is
0.5-1 mg which is independent of iron intake. This loss is
nearly twice more (i.e. 1-2 mg/day) in menstruating women.
Iron is lost from the body in both sexes as a result of
desquamation of epithelial cells from the gastrointestinal

SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
Figure 12.11
Daily iron cycle. Iron on absorption from upper small intestine circulates in plasma bound to transferrin and is transported to the
bone marrow for utilisation in haemoglobin synthesis. The mature red cells are released into circulation, which on completion of their lifespan of 120
days, die. They are then phagocytosed by RE cells and iron stored as ferritin and haemosiderin. Stored iron is mobilised in response to increased
demand and used for haemoglobin synthesis, thus completing the cycle (M = males; F = females).
tract, from excretion in the urine and sweat, and loss via hair
and nails. Iron excreted in the faeces mainly consists of
unabsorbed iron and desquamated mucosal cells.
DISTRIBUTION. In an adult, iron is distributed in the body
as under:
1.
Haemoglobin—present in the red cells, contains most of
the body iron (65%).
2.
Myoglobin—comprises a small amount of iron in the
muscles (3.5%).
3.
Haem and non-haem enzymes—e.g. cytochrome,
catalase, peroxidases, succinic dehydrogenase and
flavoproteins constitute a fraction of total body iron (0.5%).
4.
Transferrin-bound iron—circulates in the plasma and
constitutes another fraction of total body iron (0.5%).
All these forms of iron are in functional form.
5.
Ferritin and haemosiderin—are the storage forms of excess
iron (30%). They are stored in the mononuclear-phagocyte
cells of the spleen, liver and bone marrow and in the
parenchymal cells of the liver.
Pathogenesis
Iron deficiency anaemia develops when the supply of iron is
inadequate for the requirement of haemoglobin synthesis.
Initially, negative iron balance is covered by mobilisation
from the tissue stores so as to maintain haemoglobin
synthesis. It is only after the tissue stores of iron are exhausted
that the supply of iron to the marrow becomes insufficient
for haemoglobin formation and thus a state of iron deficiency
anaemia develops. The development of iron deficiency
depends upon one or more of the following factors:
1.
Increased blood loss
2.
Increased requirements
3.
Inadequate dietary intake
4.
Decreased intestinal absorption.
The relative significance of these factors varies with the
age and sex of the patient (Table 12.4). Accordingly, certain

297
CHAPTER 12
Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series
groups of individuals at increased risk of developing iron
deficiency can be identified (see below). In general, in
developed countries the mechanism of iron deficiency is
usually due to chronic occult blood loss, while in the
developing countries poor intake of iron or defective
absorption are responsible for iron deficiency anaemia.
Etiology
Iron deficiency anaemia is always secondary to an underlying
disorder. Correction of the underlying cause, therefore, is
essential part of its treatment. Based on the above-mentioned
pathogenetic mechanisms, following etiologic factors are
involved in development of iron deficiency anaemia at
different age and sex (Table 12.4):
1.
FEMALES IN REPRODUCTIVE PERIOD OF LIFE. The
highest incidence of iron deficiency anaemia is in women
during their reproductive years of life. It may be from one or
more of the following causes:
i)
Blood loss. This is the most important cause of anaemia in
women during child-bearing age group. Commonly, it is due
to persistent and heavy menstrual blood loss such as occurs
in various pathological states and due to insertion of IUCDs.
Young girls at the onset of menstruation may develop mild
anaemia due to blood loss. Significant blood loss may occur
as a result of repeated miscarriages.
Figure 12.12
Contrasting pathways of absorption and transport of iron, vitamin B12 and folic acid.
TABLE 12.4: Etiology of Iron Deficiency Anaemia.
I.
INCREASED BLOOD LOSS
1.
Uterine e.g. excessive menstruation in reproductive years,
repeated miscarriages, at onset of menarche, post-menopausal
uterine bleeding.
2.
Gastrointestinal e.g. peptic ulcer, haemorrhoids, hookworm
infestation, cancer of stomach and large bowel, oesophageal
varices, hiatus hernia, chronic aspirin ingestion, ulcerative colitis,
diverticulosis.
3.
Renal tract e.g. haematuria, haemoglobinuria.
4.
Nose e.g. repeated epistaxis.
5.
Lungs e.g. haemoptysis.
II. INCREASED REQUIREMENTS
1.
Spurts of growth in infancy, childhood and adolescence.
2.
Prematurity.
3.
Pregnancy and lactation.
III. INADEQUATE DIETARY INTAKE
1.
Poor economic status.
2.
Anorexia e.g. in pregnancy.
3.
Elderly individuals due to poor dentition, apathy and
financial constraints.
IV. DECREASED ABSORPTION
1.
Partial or total gastrectomy
2.
Achlorhydria
3.
Intestinal malabsorption such as in coeliac disease.

298
SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
ii) Inadequate intake. Inadequate intake of iron is prevalent
in women of lower economic status. Besides diet deficient in
iron, other factors such as anorexia, impaired absorption and
diminished bioavailability may act as contributory factors.
iii) Increased requirements. During pregnancy and
adolescence, the demand of body for iron is increased. During
a normal pregnancy, about 750 mg of iron may be siphoned
off from the mother—about 400 mg to the foetus, 150 mg to
the placenta, and 200 mg is lost at parturition and lactation.
If several pregnancies occur at short intervals, iron deficiency
anaemia certainly follows.
2.
POST-MENOPAUSAL FEMALES.  Though the
physiological demand for iron decreases after cessation of
menstruation, iron deficiency anaemia may develop in post-
menopausal women due to chronic blood loss. Following are
among the important causes during these years:
i)
Post-menopausal uterine bleeding due to carcinoma of the
uterus.
ii) Bleeding from the alimentary tract such as due to carcinoma
of stomach and large bowel and hiatus hernia.
3.
ADULT MALES.  It is uncommon for adult males to
develop iron deficiency anaemia in the presence of normal
dietary iron content and iron absorption. The vast majority
of cases of iron deficiency anaemia in adult males are due to
chronic blood loss. The cause for chronic haemorrhage may
lie at one of the following sites:
i)
Gastrointestinal tract is the usual source of bleeding which
may be due to peptic ulcer, haemorrhoids, hookworm
infestation, carcinoma of stomach and large bowel,
oesophageal varices, hiatus hernia, chronic aspirin ingestion
and ulcerative colitis. Other causes in the GIT are
malabsorption and following gastrointestinal surgery.
ii) Urinary tract e.g. due to haematuria and haemoglobinuria.
iii) Nose e.g. in repeated epistaxis.
iv) Lungs e.g. in haemoptysis from various causes.
4.
INFANTS AND CHILDREN. Iron deficiency anaemia
is fairly common during infancy and childhood with a peak
incidence at 1-2 years of age. The principal cause for anaemia
at this age is increased demand of iron which is not met by
the inadequate intake of iron in the diet. Normal full-term
infant has sufficient iron stores for the first 4-6 months of
life, while premature infants have inadequate reserves
because iron stores from the mother are mainly laid down
during the last trimester of pregnancy. Therefore, unless the
infant is given supplemental feeding of iron or iron-
containing foods, iron deficiency anaemia develops.
Clinical Features
As already mentioned, iron deficiency anaemia is much more
common in women between the age of 20 and 45 years than
in men; at periods of active growth in infancy, childhood
and adolescence; and is also more frequent in premature
infants. Initially, there are usually no clinical abnormalities.
But subsequently, in addition to features of the underlying
disorder causing the anaemia, the clinical consequences of
iron deficiency manifest in 2 ways—anaemia itself and
epithelial tissue changes.
1.
ANAEMIA. The onset of iron deficiency anaemia is
generally slow. The usual symptoms are weakness, fatigue,
dyspnoea on exertion, palpitations and pallor of the skin,
mucous membranes and sclerae. Older patients may develop
angina and congestive cardiac failure. Patients may have
unusual dietary cravings such as pica. Menorrhagia is a
common symptom in iron deficient women.
2.
EPITHELIAL TISSUE CHANGES. Long-standing
chronic iron deficiency anaemia causes epithelial tissue
changes in some patients. The changes occur in the nails
(koilonychia or spoon-shaped nails), tongue (atrophic
glossitis), mouth (angular stomatitis), and oesophagus
causing dysphagia from development of thin, membranous
webs at the postcricoid area (Plummer-Vinson syndrome).
Figure 12.13
Laboratory findings in iron deficiency anaemia.

299
CHAPTER 12
Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series
Laboratory Findings
The development of anaemia progresses in 3 stages:
Firstly, storage iron depletion occurs during which iron
reserves are lost without compromise of the iron supply
for erythropoiesis.
The next stage is iron deficient erythropoiesis during
which the erythroid iron supply is reduced without the
development of anaemia.
The final stage is the development of frank iron
deficiency anaemia when the red cells become microcytic
and hypochromic.
The following laboratory tests can be used to assess the
varying degree of iron deficiency (Fig. 12.13):
1.BLOOD PICTURE AND RED CELL INDICES. The
degree of anaemia varies. It is usually mild to moderate
but occasionally it may be marked (haemoglobin less than
6 g/dl) due to persistent and severe blood loss. The salient
haematological findings in these cases are as under.
i) Haemoglobin. The essential feature is a fall in
haemoglobin concentration up to a variable degree.
ii) Red cells. The red cells in the blood film are hypo-
chromic and microcytic, and there is anisocytosis and
poikilocytosis (Fig. 12.14,A). Hypochromia generally
precedes microcytosis. Hypochromia is due to poor filling
of the red cells with haemoglobin so that there is increased
central pallor. In severe cases, there may be only a thin
rim of pink staining at the periphery. Target cells, elliptical
forms and polychromatic cells are often present.
Normoblasts are uncommon. RBC count is below normal
but is generally not proportionate to the fall in
haemoglobin value. When iron deficiency is associated
with severe folate or vitamin B12 deficiency, a dimorphic
blood picture occurs with dual population of red cells—
macrocytic as well as microcytic hypochromic.
iii) Reticulocyte count. The reticulocyte count is normal
or reduced but may be slightly raised (2-5%) in cases after
haemorrhage.
iv) Absolute values. The red cell indices reveal a
diminished MCV (below 50 fl), diminished MCH (below
15 pg), and diminished MCHC (below 20 g/dl).
v) Leucocytes. The total and differential white cell counts
are usually normal.
vi) Platelets. Platelet count is usually normal but may be
slightly to moderately raised in patients who have had
recent bleeding.
2.BONE MARROW FINDINGS.  Bone marrow exami-
nation is not essential in such cases routinely but is done
in complicated cases so as to distinguish from other
hypochromic anaemias. The usual findings are as follows
(Fig.12.14,B):
i) Marrow cellularity.  The marrow cellularity is increased
due to erythroid hyperplasia (myeloid-erythroid ratio
decreased).
ii)Erythropoiesis.  There is normoblastic erythropoiesis
with predominance of small polychromatic normoblasts
(micronormoblasts). These normoblasts have a thin rim
of cytoplasm around the nucleus and a ragged and
irregular cell border. The cytoplasmic maturation lags behind
so that the late normoblasts have pyknotic nucleus but
persisting polychromatic cytoplasm (compared from
megaloblastic anaemia in which the nuclear maturation
lags behind, page 307).
iii) Other cells. Myeloid, lymphoid and megakaryocytic
cells are normal in number and morphology.
iv) Marrow iron. Iron staining (Prussian blue reaction)
carried out on bone marrow aspirate smear shows
Figure 12.14

deficient reticuloendothelial iron stores and absence of
siderotic iron granules from developing normoblasts.
3.BIOCHEMICAL FINDINGS.  In addition to blood and
bone marrow examination, the following biochemical tests
are of value:
i) The serum iron level is low (normal 40-140 μg/dl); it is
often under 50 μg/dl. When serum iron falls below
15 μg/dl, marrow iron stores are absent.
ii) Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) is high (normal 250-
450 μg/dl) and rises to give less than 10% saturation
(normal 33%). In anaemia of chronic disorders, however,
serum iron as well as TIBC are reduced.
iii) Serum ferritin is very low (normal 30-250 ng/ml)
indicating poor tissue iron stores. The serum ferritin is
raised in iron overload and is normal in anaemia of chronic
disorders.
iv) Red cell protoporphyrin is very low (normal 20-40
μg/dl) as a result of insufficient iron supply to form haem.
v) Serum transferrin receptor protein which is normally
present on developing erythroid cells and reflects total
red cell mass, is raised in iron deficiency due to its release
in circulation (normal level 4-9 μg/L as determined by
immunoassay).
Treatment
The management of iron deficiency anaemia consists of
2 essential principles: correction of disorder causing the
anaemia, and correction of iron deficiency.
1.
CORRECTION OF THE DISORDER. The underlying
cause of iron deficiency is established after thorough check-
up and investigations. Appropriate surgical, medical or
preventive measures are instituted to correct the cause of
blood loss.
2.
CORRECTIONOF IRON DEFICIENCY. The lack of
iron is corrected with iron therapy as under:
i) Oral therapy. Iron deficiency responds very effectively
to the administration of oral iron salts such as ferrous sulfate,
ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate and polysaccharide iron.
These preparations have varying amount of elemental iron
in each tablet ranging from 39 mg to 105 mg. Optimal
absorption is obtained by giving iron fasting, but if side-
effects occur (e.g. nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea)
iron can be given with food or by using a preparation of lower
iron content (e.g. ferrous gluconate containing 39 mg
elemental iron). Oral iron therapy is continued long enough,
both to correct the anaemia and to replenish the body iron
stores. The response to oral iron therapy is observed by
reticulocytosis which begins to appear in 3-4 days with a
peak in about 10 days. Poor response to iron replacement
may occur from various causes such as: incorrect diagnosis,
non-compliance, continuing blood loss, bone marrow
suppression by tumour or chronic inflammation, and
malabsorption.
ii) Parenteral therapy. Parenteral iron therapy is indicated
in cases who are intolerant to oral iron therapy, in GIT
disorders such as malabsorption, or a rapid replenishment
of iron stores is desired such as in women with severe
anaemia a few weeks before expected date of delivery.
Parenteral iron therapy is hazardous and expensive when
compared with oral administration. The haematological
response to parenteral iron therapy is no faster than the
administration of adequate dose of oral iron but the stores
are replenished much faster. Before giving the parenteral
iron, total dose is calculated by a simple formula by multi-
plying the grams of haemoglobin below normal with 250
(250 mg of elemental iron is required for each gram of deficit
haemoglobin), plus an additional 500 mg is added for
building up iron stores. A common preparation is iron
dextran which may be given as a single intramuscular
injection, or as intravenous infusion after dilution with
dextrose or saline. The adverse effects with iron dextran
include hypersensitivity or anaphylactoid reactions,
haemolysis, hypotension, circulatory collapse, vomiting and
muscle pain. Newer iron complexes such as sodium ferric
gluconate and iron sucrose can be administered as repeated
intravenous injections with much lower side effects.
SIDEROBLASTIC ANAEMIA
The sideroblastic anaemias comprise a group of disorders of
diverse etiology in which the nucleated erythroid precursors
in the bone marrow, show characteristic ‘ringed sideroblasts.’
Siderocytes and Sideroblasts
Siderocytes and sideroblasts are erythrocytes and
normoblasts respectively which contain cytoplasmic granules
of iron (Fig.12.15).
SIDEROCYTES. These are red cells containing granules of
non-haem iron. These granules stain positively with Prussian
blue reaction as well as stain with Romanowsky dyes when
they are referred to as Pappenheimer bodies. Siderocytes are
normally not present in the human peripheral blood but a
small number may appear following splenectomy. This is
because the reticulocytes on release from the marrow are
finally sequestered in the spleen to become mature red cells.
In the absence of spleen, the final maturation step takes place
in the peripheral blood and hence siderocytes make their
appearance in the blood after splenectomy.
SIDEROBLASTS. These are nucleated red cells (normo-
blasts) containing siderotic granules which stain positively
Figure 12.15

normal sideroblast and a ring sideroblast.

301
CHAPTER 12
Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series
with Prussian blue reaction. Depending upon the number,
size and distribution of siderotic granules, sideroblasts may
be normal or abnormal (Fig. 12.16).
Normal sideroblasts  contain a few fine, scattered cytoplasmic
granules representing iron which has not been utilised for
haemoglobin synthesis. These cells comprise 30-50% of
normoblasts in the normal marrow but are reduced or absent
in iron deficiency.
Abnormal sideroblasts are further of 2 types:
One type is a sideroblast containing numerous, diffusely
scattered, coarse cytoplasmic granules and are seen in
conditions such as dyserythropoiesis and haemolysis. In this
type, there is no defect of haem or globin synthesis but the
percentage saturation of transferrin is increased.
The other type is ringed sideroblast in which haem
synthesis is disturbed as occurs in sideroblastic anaemias.
Ringed sideroblasts contain numerous large granules, often
forming a complete or partial ring around the nucleus. The
ringed arrangement of these granules is due to the presence
of iron-laden mitochondria around the nucleus.
Types of Sideroblastic Anaemias
Based on etiology, sideroblastic anaemias are classified into
hereditary and acquired types. The acquired type is further
divided into primary and secondary forms:
I.
HEREDITARY SIDEROBLASTIC ANAEMIA.  This is
a rare X-linked disorder associated with defective enzyme
activity of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthetase required for
haem synthesis. The affected males have moderate to marked
anaemia while the females are carriers of the disorder and
do not develop anaemia. The condition manifests in
childhood or in early adult life.
II. ACQUIRED SIDEROBLASTIC ANAEMIA.  The
acquired sideroblastic anaemias are classified into primary
and secondary types.
A. Primary acquired sideroblastic anaemia. Primary, idio-
pathic, or refractory acquired sideroblastic anaemia occurs
spontaneously in middle-aged and older individuals of both
sexes. The disorder has its pathogenesis in disturbed growth
and maturation of erythroid precursors at the level of
haematopoietic stem cell, possibly due to reduced activity
of the enzyme, ALA synthetase. The anaemia is of moderate
to severe degree and appears insidiously. The bone marrow
cells commonly show chromosomal abnormalities, neutro-
penia and thrombocytopenia with associated bleeding
diathesis. The spleen and liver may be either normal or mildly
enlarged, while the lymph nodes are not enlarged. Unlike
other types of sideroblastic anaemia, this type is regarded as
a myelodysplastic disorder in the FAB (French-American-
British) classification and thus, can be a preleukaemic
disorder (page 361). About 10% of individuals with refractory
acquired sideroblastic anaemia develop acute myelogenous
leukaemia.
B. Secondary acquired sideroblastic anaemia. Acquired
sideroblastic anaemia may develop secondary to a variety
of drugs, chemicals, toxins, haematological and various other
diseases.
1.
Drugs, chemicals and toxins: Isoniazid, an anti-tuberculous
drug and a pyridoxine antagonist, is most commonly
associated with development of sideroblastic anaemia by
producing abnormalities in pyridoxine metabolism. Other
drugs occasionally causing acquired sideroblastic anaemia
are: cycloserine, chloramphenicol and alkylating agents (e.g.
cyclophosphamide). Alcohol and lead also cause
sideroblastic anaemia. All these agents cause reversible
sideroblastic anaemia which usually resolves following
removal of the offending agent.
2.
Haematological disorders: These include myelofibrosis,
polycythaemia vera, acute leukaemia, myeloma, lymphoma
and haemolytic anaemia.
3.
Miscellaneous: Occasionally, secondary sideroblastic
anaemia may occur in association with a variety of inflam-
matory, neoplastic and autoimmune diseases such as
carcinoma, myxoedema, rheumatoid arthritis and SLE.
Laboratory Findings
Sideroblastic anaemias usually show the following
haematological features:
1. There is generally moderate to severe degree of anaemia.
2.The blood picture shows hypochromic anaemia which
may be microcytic, or there may be some normocytic red
cells as well (dimorphic).
3. Absolute values (MCV, MCH and MCHC) are reduced
in hereditary type but MCV is often raised in acquired
type.
4. Bone marrow examination shows erythroid hyperplasia
with usually macronormoblastic erythropoiesis. Marrow
iron stores are raised and pathognomonic ring sideroblasts
are present.
5. Serum ferritin levels are raised.
6. Serum iron is usually raised with almost complete
saturation of TIBC.
7. There is increased iron deposition in the tissue.

Treatment
The treatment of secondary sideroblastic anaemia is
primarily focussed on removal of the offending agent. No
definite treatment is available for hereditary and idiopathic
types of sideroblastic anaemias. However, pyridoxine is
administered routinely to all cases of sideroblastic anaemia
(200 mg per day for 2-3 months). Blood transfusions and other
supportive therapy are indicated in all patients.
Differential diagnosis of various types of hypochromic
anaemias by laboratory tests is summarised in Table 12.5.
ANAEMIA OF CHRONIC DISORDERS
One of the commonly encountered anaemia is in patients of
a variety of chronic systemic diseases in which anaemia
develops secondary to a disease process but there is no actual
invasion of the bone marrow. A list of such chronic systemic
diseases is given in Table 12.6. In general, anaemia in chronic
disorders is usually normocytic normochromic but can have
mild degree of microcytosis and hypochromia unrelated to
iron deficiency. The severity of anaemia is usually directly
related to the primary disease process. The anaemia is
corrected only if the primary disease is alleviated.
Pathogenesis
A number of factors may contribute to the development of
anaemia in chronic systemic disorders, and in many condi-
tions, the anaemia is complicated by other causes such as
iron, B12 and folate deficiency, hypersplenism, renal failure
with consequent reduced erythropoietic activity, endocrine
abnormalities etc. However, in general, 2 factors appear to
play significant role in the pathogenesis of anaemia in chronic
disorders. These are: defective red cell production and reduced
red cell lifespan.
1.
Defective red cell production. Though there is abun-
dance of storage iron in these conditions but the amount of
iron available to developing erythroid cells in the marrow is
subnormal. The mononuclear phagocyte system is
hyperplastic which traps all the available free iron due to
the activity of iron binding protein, lactoferrin. A defect in
the transfer of iron from macrophages to the developing
erythroid cells in the marrow leads to reduced availability
of iron for haem synthesis despite adequate iron stores,
elevating serum ferritin levels. The defect lies in suppression
of erythropoieitn by inflammatory cytokines at some stage
in erythropoiesis, and hepcidin which is the key iron
regulatory hormone. These inflammatory cytokines include
TNF and IFN-β released in bacterial infections and tumours,
and IL-1 and IFN-γ released in patients of rheumatoid
arthritis and autoimmune vasculitis (Fig. 12.17).
2.
Reduced red cell lifespan. Decreased survival of
circulating red cells in chronic renal disease is attributed to
hyperplastic mononuclear phagocyte system.
Laboratory Findings
The characteristic features of anaemia in these patients
uncomplicated by other deficiencies are as under:
i) Haemoglobin. Anaemia is generally mild to moderate.
A haemoglobin value of less than 8 g/dl suggests the
presence of additional contributory factors.
ii) Blood picture. The type of anaemia in these cases is
generally normocytic normochromic but may have slight
microcytosis and hypochromia.
iii) Absolute values. Red cell indices indicate that in spite
of normocytic normochromic anaemia, MCHC is slightly
low.
iv) Reticulocyte count. The reticulocyte count is generally
low.

v) Red cell survival. Measurement of erythrocyte survival
generally reveals mild to moderate shortening of their
lifespan.
vi) Bone  marrow. Examination of the marrow generally
reveals normal erythroid maturation. However, the red
cell precursors have reduced stainable iron than normal,
while macrophages in the marrow usually contain
increased amount of iron. Cases of chronic infection often
have myeloid hyperplasia and increase in plasma cells.
vii) Serum iron and TIBC. Serum iron is characteristically
reduced in this group of anaemias while TIBC is low-to-
normal (in contrast to iron deficiency where there is
reduction in serum iron but high TIBC, see Table12.5).
viii) Serum ferritin. Serum ferritin levels are increased in
these patients and is the most distinguishing feature
between true iron-deficiency anaemia and iron-deficient
erythropoieisis in anemia of chronic diseases.
ix)Other plasma proteins.  In addition, certain other
plasma proteins called ‘phase reactants’ are raised in
patients with chronic inflammation, probably under the
stimulus of interleukin-1 released by activated
macrophages. These proteins include γ-globulin, C3,
haptoglobin, α1-antitrypsin and fibrinogen. Elevation of
these proteins is responsible for raised ESR commonly
present in these patients.
MEGALOBLASTIC ANAEMIA
The megaloblastic anaemias are disorders caused by
impaired DNA synthesis and are characterised by a distinc-
tive abnormality in the haematopoietic precursors in the bone
marrow in which the maturation of the nucleus is delayed relative
to that of the cytoplasm. Since cell division is slow but
cytoplasmic development progresses normally, the nucleated
red cell precursors tend to be larger which Ehrlich in 1880
termed megaloblasts. Megaloblasts are both morphologically
and functionally abnormal with the result that the mature
red cells formed from them and released into the peripheral
blood are also abnormal in shape and size, the most
prominent abnormality being macrocytosis.
The underlying defect for the asynchronous maturation
of the nucleus is defective DNA synthesis due to deficiency
of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) and/or folic acid (folate). Less
common causes are interference with DNA synthesis by
congenital or acquired abnormalities of vitamin B12 or folic
acid metabolism. Before considering the megaloblastic
anaemia, an outline of vitamin B12 and folic acid metabolism
is given for a better understanding of the subject.
The salient nutritional aspects and metabolic functions
of vitamin B12 and folic acid are summarised in Table12.7.
Vitamin B12 Metabolism
BIOCHEMISTRY. Vitamin B12 or cobalamin is a complex
organometallic compound having a cobalt atom situated
within a corrin ring, similar to the structure of porphyrin
from which haem is formed. In humans, there are
2 metabolically active forms of cobalamin—methyl-
cobalamin and adenosyl-cobalamin, which act as
coenzymes. The therapeutic vitamin B12 preparation is
called cyanocobalamin.
SOURCES. The only dietary sources of vitamin B12 are foods
of animal protein origin such as kidney, liver, heart, muscle
meats, fish, eggs, cheese and milk. In contrast to folate, fruits
and vegetables contain practically no vitamin B12 unless
contaminated with bacteria. Cooking has little effect on its
activity. Vitamin B12 is synthesised in the human large bowel
by microorganisms but is not absorbed from this site and,

Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
thus, the humans are entirely dependent upon dietary
sources. The average daily requirement for vitamin B12 is
2-4 μg.
ABSORPTION. After ingestion, vitamin B12 in food is
released and forms a stable complex with gastric R-binder.
R-binder is a form of glycoprotein found in various secretions
(e.g. saliva, milk, gastric juice, bile), phagocytes and plasma.
On entering the duodenum, the vitamin B12-R-binder
complex is digested releasing vitamin B12 which then binds
to intrinsic factor (IF). The IF is a glycoprotein of molecular
weight 50,000 produced by the parietal cells of the stomach
and its secretion roughly parallels that of hydrochloric acid.
The vitamin B12-IF complex, on reaching the distal ileum,
binds to the specific receptors on the mucosal brush border,
thereby enabling the vitamin to be absorbed. The IF,
therefore, acts as cell-directed carrier protein similar to
transferrin. The receptor-bound vitamin B12-IF complex is
taken into the ileal mucosal cells where after several hours
the IF is destroyed, vitamin B12 released and is transferred
to another transport protein, transcobalamin (TC) II. The
vitamin B12-TC II complex is finally secreted into the portal
circulation from where it is taken by the liver, bone marrow
and other cells. There are 2 major vitamin B12 binding
proteins—TC I and TC II, and a minor protein TC III. TC I is
not essential for vitamin B12 transport but functions primarily
as a storage protein while TC III is similar to TC II and binds
a small amount of vitamin B12 (see Fig. 12.12,B).
TISSUE STORES. Normally, the liver is the principal storage
site of vitamin B12 and stores about 2 mg of the vitamin, while
other tissues like kidney, heart and brain together store about
2 mg. The body stores of vitamin B12 are adequate for 2-4
years. Major source of loss is via bile and shedding of
intestinal epithelial cells. A major part of the excreted vitamin
B12 is reabsorbed in the ileum by the IF resulting in
enterohepatic circulation.
FUNCTIONS. Vitamin B12 plays an important role in general
cell metabolism, particulary essential for normal
haematopoiesis and for maintenance of integrity of the
nervous system. Vitamin B12 acts as a co-enzyme for 2 main
biochemical reactions in the body:
Firstly, as methyl cobalamin (methyl B12) in the methylation
of homocysteine to methionine by methyl tetrahydrofolate
(THF). The homocysteine-methionine reaction is closely
linked to folate metabolism (Fig.  12.18):
Methyl B
12
Homocysteine 
  Methionine
When this reaction is impaired, folate metabolism is
deranged and results in defective DNA synthesis responsible
for megaloblastic maturation.
Secondly, as adenosyl cobalamin (adenosyl B12) in propionate
metabolism for the conversion of methyl malonyl co-enzyme
A to succinyl co-enzyme A:
Adenosyl B12
Propionyl CoA →Methyl malonyl CoA →Succinyl CoA
Lack of adenosyl B12 leads to large increase in the level
of methyl malonyl CoA and its precursor, propionyl CoA.
This results in synthesis of certain fatty acids which are
incorporated into the neuronal lipids. This biochemical
abnormality may contribute to the neurologic complications
of vitamin B12 deficiency.
Folate Metabolism
BIOCHEMISTRY. Folate or folic acid, a yellow compound,
is a member of water-soluble B complex vitamins with the
chemical name of pteroyl glutamic acid (PGA). Folic acid does
not exist as such in nature but exists as folates in
polyglutamate form (conjugated folates). For its metabolic
action as co-enzyme, polyglutamates must be reduced to
dihydro- and tetrahydrofolate forms.
SOURCES. Folate exists in different plants, bacteria and
animal tissues. Its main dietary sources are fresh green leafy
vegetables, fruits, liver, kidney, and to a lesser extent, muscle
meats, cereals and milk. Folate is labile and is largely
destroyed by cooking and canning. Some amount of folate
synthesised by bacteria in the human large bowel is not
available to the body because its absorption takes place in
the small intestine. Thus, humans are mainly dependent
upon diet for its supply. The average daily requirement is
100-200 μg.
ABSORPTION AND TRANSPORT. Folate is normally
absorbed from the duodenum and upper jejunum and to a
lesser extent, from the lower jejunum and ileum. However,
absorption depends upon the form of folate in the diet.
Polyglutamate form in the foodstuffs is first cleaved by the
enzyme, folate conjugase, in the mucosal cells to mono- and
diglutamates which are readily assimilated. Synthetic folic
acid preparations in polyglutamate form are also absorbed
as rapidly as mono- and diglutamate form because of the
Figure 12.18
Biochemical basis of megaloblastic anaemia (THF =
tetrahydrofolate; DHF = dihydrofolate; PGA = pteroyl glutamic acid; dUMP
= deoxy uridylate monophosphate; dTMP = deoxy thymidylate monophos-
phate).

305
CHAPTER 12
Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series
absence of natural inhibitors. Mono- and diglutamates
undergo further reduction in the mucosal cells to form
tetrahydrofolate (THF), a monoglutamate. THF circulates in
the plasma as methylated compound, methyl THF, bound
to a protein. Once methyl THF is transported into the cell by
a carrier protein, it is reconverted to polyglutamate (see
Fig. 12.12,C).
TISSUE STORES. The liver and red cells are the main storage
sites of folate, largely as methyl THF polyglutamate form.
The total body stores of folate are about 10-12 mg enough
for about 4 months. Normally, folate is lost from the sweat,
saliva, urine and faeces.
FUNCTIONS. Folate plays an essential role in cellular
metabolism. It acts as a co-enzyme for 2 important bio-
chemical reactions involving transfer of 1-carbon units (viz.
methyl and formyl groups) to various other compounds.
These reactions are as under:
Thymidylate synthetase reaction. Formation of deoxy
thymidylate monophosphate (dTMP) from its precursor
form, deoxy uridylate monophosphate (dUMP).
Methylation of homocysteine to methionine. This reaction is
linked to vitamin B12 metabolism (Fig. 12.18).
These biochemical reactions are considered in detail
below together with biochemical basis of the megaloblastic
anaemia.
Biochemical Basis of Megaloblastic Anaemia
The basic biochemical abnormality common to both vitamin
B12 and folate deficiency is a block in the pathway of DNA
synthesis and that there is an inter-relationship between
vitamin B12 and folate metabolism in the methylation reaction
of homocysteine to methionine (Fig. 12.18).
As stated above, folate as co-enzyme methylene THF, is
required for transfer of 1-carbon moieties (e.g. methyl and
formyl) to form building blocks in DNA synthesis. These
1-carbon moieties are derived from serine or formimino-
glutamic acid (FIGLU). Two of the important folate-
dependent (1-carbon transfer) reactions for formation of
building blocks in DNA synthesis are as under:
1.
Thymidylate synthetase reaction. This reaction involves
synthesis of deoxy thymidylate monophosphate (dTMP)
from deoxy uridylate monophosphate (dUMP). The methyl
group of dUMP → dTMP reaction is supplied by the co-
enzyme, methylene-THF. After the transfer of 1-carbon from
methylene-THF, dihydrofolate (DHF) is produced which
must be reduced to active THF by the enzyme DHF-reductase
before it can participate in further 1-carbon transfer reaction.
Drugs like methotrexate (anti-cancer) and pyrimethamine
(antimalarial) are inhibitory to the enzyme, DHF-reductase,
thereby inhibiting the DNA synthesis.
2.
Homocysteine-methionine reaction.  Homocysteine is
converted into methionine by transfer of a methyl group from
methylene-THF. After transfer of 1-carbon from methylene-
THF, THF is produced. This reaction requires the presence
of vitamin B12 (methyl-B12).
Deficiency of folate from any cause results in reduced
supply of the coenzyme, methylene-THF, and thus interferes
with the synthesis of DNA. Deficiency of vitamin B12 traps
folate as its transport form, methyl-THF, thereby resulting
in reduced formation of the active form, methylene-THF,
needed for DNA synthesis. This is referred to as methyl-folate
trap hypothesis. An alternative hypothesis of inter-relationship
of B12 and folate is the formate-saturation hypothesis. According
to this hypothesis, the active substrate is formyl-THF.
Vitamin B12 deficiency results in reduced supply of formate
to THF causing reduced generation of the active compound,
formyl THF.
Etiology and Classification of Megaloblastic Anaemia
The etiology of megaloblastic anaemia varies in different
parts of the world. As outlined in Table 12.8,megaloblastic
anaemia is classified into 3 broad groups: vitamin B12
deficiency, folate deficiency, and deficiency from other
causes.
1.
VITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY. In Western countries,
deficiency of vitamin B12 is more commonly due to pernicious
(Addisonian) anaemia. True vegetarians like traditional
Indian Hindus and breast-fed infants have dietary lack of
vitamin B12. Gastrectomy by lack of intrinsic factor, and small
intestinal lesions involving distal ileum where absorption of
vitamin B12 occurs, may cause deficiency of the vitamin.
Deficiency of vitamin B12 takes at least 2 years to develop
when the body stores are totally depleted.
2.
FOLATE DEFICIENCY. Folate deficiency is more often
due to poor dietary intake. Other causes include
TABLE 12.8: Etiologic Classification of Megaloblastic
Anaemia.
I.
VITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY
A. Inadequate dietary intake e.g. strict vegetarians, breast-fed infants.
B. Malabsorption
1. Gastric causes: pernicious anaemia, gastrectomy, congenital lack
of intrinsic factor.
2. Intestinal causes: tropical sprue, ileal resection, Crohn’s disease,
intestinal blind loop syndrome, fish-tapeworm infestation.
II. FOLATE DEFICIENCY
A. Inadequate dietary intake e.g. in alcoholics, teenagers, infants, old
age, poverty.
B. Malabsorption e.g. in tropical sprue, coeliac disease, partial
gastrectomy, jejunal resection, Crohn’s disease.
C. Excess demand
1. Physiological: pregnancy, lactation, infancy.
2. Pathological : malignancy, increased haematopoiesis, chronic
exfoliative skin disorders, tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis.
D. Excess urinary folate loss e.g. in active liver disease, congestive
heart failure.
III. OTHER CAUSES
A. Impaired metabolism e.g. inhibitors of dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase
such as methotrexate and pyrimethamine; alcohol, congenital
enzyme deficiencies.
B. Unknown etiology e.g. in Di Guglielmo’s syndrome, congenital
dyserythropoietic anaemia, refractory megaloblastic anaemia.

306
SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
malabsorption, excess folate utilisation such as in pregnancy
and in various disease states, chronic alcoholism, and excess
urinary folate loss. Folate deficiency arises more rapidly than
vitamin B12 deficiency since the body’s stores of folate are
relatively low which can last for up to 4 months only.
Patients with tropical sprue are often deficient in both
vitamin B12 and folate. Combined deficiency of vitamin B12
and folate may occur from severe deficiency of vitamin B12
because of the biochemical interrelationship with folate
metabolism.
3.
OTHER CAUSES. In addition to deficiency of vitamin
B12 and folate, megaloblastic anaemias may occasionally be
induced by other factors unrelated to vitamin deficiency.
These include many drugs which interfere with DNA
synthesis, acquired defects of haematopoietic stem cells, and
rarely, congenital enzyme deficiencies.
Clinical Features
Deficiency of vitamin B12 and folate may cause following
clinical manifestations which may be present singly or in
combination and in varying severity:
1.
Anaemia. Macrocytic megaloblastic anaemia is the
cardinal feature of deficiency of vitamin B12 and/or folate.
The onset of anaemia is usually insidious and gradually
progressive.
2.
Glossitis. Typically, the patient has a smooth, beefy, red
tongue.
3.
Neurologic manifestations. Vitamin B12 deficiency, parti-
cularly in patients of pernicious anaemia, is associated with
significant neurological manifestations in the form of
subacute combined, degeneration of the spinal cord and
peripheral neuropathy (Chapter 30), while folate deficiency
may occasionally develop neuropathy only. The underlying
pathologic process consists of demyelination of the peripheral
nerves, the spinal cord and the cerebrum. Signs and
symptoms include numbness, paraesthesia, weakness,
ataxia, poor finger coordination and diminished reflexes.
4.
Others. In addition to the cardinal features mentioned
above, patients may have various other symptoms. These
include: mild jaundice, angular stomatitis, purpura, melanin
pigmentation, symptoms of malabsorption, weight loss and
anorexia.
Laboratory Findings
The investigations of a suspected case of megaloblastic
anaemia are aimed at 2 aspects:
A. General laboratory investigations of anaemia which include
blood picture, red cell indices, bone marrow findings, and
biochemical tests.
B. Special tests to establish the cause of megaloblastic anaemia
as to know whether it is due to deficiency of vitamin B12
or folate.
Based on these principles, the following scheme of
investigations is followed:
A. General Laboratory Findings
1. BLOOD PICTURE AND RED CELL INDICES. Esti-
mation of haemoglobin, examination of a blood film and
evaluation of absolute values are essential preliminary
investigations (Fig. 12.19):
i) Haemoglobin. Haemoglobin estimation reveals values
below the normal range. The fall in haemoglobin
concentration may be of a variable degree.
ii) Red cells. Red blood cell morphology in a blood film
shows the characteristic macrocytosis. However,
macrocytosis can also be seen in several other disorders
such as: haemolysis, liver disease, chronic alcoholism,
hypothyroidism, aplastic anaemia, myeloproliferative
disorders and reticulocytosis. In addition, the blood smear
demonstrates marked anisocytosis, poikilocytosis and
presence of macroovalocytes. Basophilic stippling and
occasional normoblast may also be seen (Fig. 12.20, A).
iii) Reticulocyte count.  The reticulocyte count is generally
low to normal in untreated cases.
Figure 12.19
General laboratory findings in megaloblastic anaemia.

307
CHAPTER 12
Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series
iv) Absolute values. The red cell indices reveal an elevated
MCV (above 120 fl) proportionate to the severity of
macrocytosis, elevated MCH (above 50 pg) and normal
or reduced MCHC.
v)Leucocytes. The total white blood cell count may be
reduced. Presence of characteristic hypersegmented
neutrophils (having more than 5 nuclear lobes) in the
blood film should raise the suspicion of megaloblastic
anaemia. An occasional myelocyte may also be seen.
vi)Platelets. Platelet count may be moderately reduced
in severely anaemic patients. Bizarre forms of platelets
may be seen.
2. BONE MARROW FINDINGS. The bone marrow
examination is very helpful in the diagnosis of
megaloblastic anaemia. Significant findings of marrow
examination are as under (Fig. 12.20,B):
i) Marrow cellularity. The marrow is hypercellular with
a decreased myeloid-erythroid ratio.
ii) Erythropoiesis.  Erythroid hyperplasia is due to
characteristic megaloblastic erythropoiesis. Megaloblasts
are abnormal, large, nucleated erythroid precursors,
having nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony i.e. the nuclei are
less mature than the development of cytoplasm. The nuclei
are large, having fine, reticular and open chromatin that
stains lightly, while the haemoglobinisation of the
cytoplasm proceeds normally or at a faster rate i.e. nuclear
maturation lags behind that of cytoplasm (compared from iron
deficiency anaemia in which cytoplasmic maturation lags
behind, page 299). Megaloblasts with abnormal mitoses
may be seen. Features of ineffective erythropoiesis such
as presence of degenerated erythroid precursors may be
present.
iii) Other cells. Granulocyte precursors are also affected
to some extent. Giant forms of metamyelocytes and band
cells may be present in the marrow. Megakaryocytes are
usually present in normal number but may occasionally
be decreased and show abnormal morphology such as
hypersegmented nuclei and agranular cytoplasm.
iv)Marrow iron. Prussian blue staining for iron in the
marrow shows an increase in the number and size of iron
granules in the erythroid precursors. Ring sideroblasts are,
however, rare. Iron in the reticulum cells is increased.
v)Chromosomes.  Marrow cells may show variety of
random chromosomal abnormalities such as chromosome
breaks, centromere spreading etc.
3.BIOCHEMICAL FINDINGS.  In addition to the general
blood and marrow investigations and specific tests to
determine the cause of deficiency (described below), the
following biochemical abnormalities are observed in cases
of megaloblastic anaemia:
i) There is rise in serum unconjugated bilirubin and LDH as
a result of ineffective erythropoiesis causing marrow cell
breakdown.
ii) The serum iron and ferritin may be normal or elevated.
B. Special Tests for Cause of Specific Deficiency
In evaluating a patient of megaloblastic anaemia, it is
important to determine the specific vitamin deficiency by
assay of vitamin B12 and folate. In sophisticated clinical
laboratories, currently automated multiparametric,
random access analysers are employed based on separa-
tion techniques by chemiluminescence and enzyme-linked
fluorescence detection systems which have largely

SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
replaced the traditional microbiologic assays for vitamin
B12 and folate. Traditional tests are briefly described below.
TESTS FOR VITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY. The normal
range of vitamin B12 in serum is 280-1000 pg/ml. Values
less than 100 pg/ml indicate clinically deficient stage.
Traditional tests employed to establish vitamin B12
deficiency are serum vitamin B12 assay, Schilling (24-hour
urinary excretion) test and serum enzyme levels.
1. SERUM VITAMIN B12 ASSAY. Assay of vitamin B12 in
blood can be done by 2 methods—microbiological assay
and radioassay.
i) Microbiological assay.  In this test, the serum sample to
be assayed is added to a medium containing all other
essential growth factors required for a vitamin
B12-dependent microorganism. The medium along with
microorganism is incubated and the amount of vitamin
B12 is determined turbimetrically which is then compared
with the growth produced by a known amount of vitamin
B12. Several organisms have been used for this test such
as Euglena gracilis, Lactobacillus leichmannii, Escherichia coli
and Ochromonas malhamensis. E. gracilis is, however, consi-
dered more sensitive and accurate. The addition of anti-
biotics to the test interferes with the growth and yields
false low result.
ii) Radioassay. Assays of serum B12 by radioisotope
dilution (RID) and radioimmunoassay (RIA) have been
developed. These tests are more sensitive and have the
advantage over microbiologic assays in that they are
simpler and more rapid, and the results are unaffected by
antibiotics and other drugs which may affect the living
organisms.
2.  SCHILLING TEST (24 HOUR URINARY EXCRETION
TEST). Schilling test is done to detect vitamin B12
deficiency as well as to distinguish and detect lack of IF
and malabsorption syndrome. The results of test also
depend upon good renal function and proper urinary
collection. Radioisotope used for labeling B12 is either 58Co
or 57Co. The test is performed in 3 stages as under:
Stage I: Without IF.  The patient after an overnight fasting
is administered oral dose of 1 μg of radioactively labelled
vitamin B12 (‘hot’ B12) in 200 ml of water. At the same
time, 1 mg of unlabelled vitamin B12 (‘cold’ B12) is given
by intramuscular route; this ‘cold’ B12 will saturate the
serum as well as the tissue binding sites. The patient is
kept fasting for a further period of 2 hours, following
which urinary excretion of B12 is estimated:
In normal individuals, 24-hour urinary excretion is
>10% of the oral dose of ‘hot’ B12.
Patients with IF deficiency excrete lower quantity of
‘hot’ B12 which is further confirmed by repeating the test
as in stage II given below.
Stage II: With IF.  If the 24-hour urinary excretion of ‘hot’
B12 is low, the test is repeated using the same procedure
as in stage I but in addition high oral dose of IF is
administered along with ‘hot’ B12.
If the 24-hour urinary excretion of ‘hot’ B12 is now
normal, the low value in first stage of the test was due to
IF deficiency (i.e. pernicious anaemia).
Patients with pernicious anaemia have abnormal test
even after treatment with vitamin B12 due to IF deficiency.
However, abnormal 24-hour urinary excretion of ‘hot’ B12
is further investigated in stage III for a cause in intestinal
malabsorption of ‘hot’ B’12.
Stage III: Test for malabsorption of vitamin B12.  Some
patients absorb vitamin B12 in water as was stipulated in
the original Schilling test. Modified Schilling test employs
the use of protein-bound vitamin B12. In conditions
causing malabsorption, the test is repeated after a course
of treatment with antibiotics or anti-inflammatory drugs.
3. SERUM ENZYME LEVELS.  Besides Schilling test,
another way of distinguishing whether megaloblastic
anaemia is due to cobalamine or folate is by serum
determination of methylmalonic acid and homocysteine
by sophisticated enzymatic assays. Both are elevated in
cobalamine deficiency, while in folate deficiency there is
only elevation of homocysteine and not of methylmalonic
acid.
TESTS FOR FOLATE DEFICIENCY. The normal range
of serum folate is 6-18 ng/ml. Values of 4 ng/ml or less
are generally considered to be diagnostic of folate
deficiency. Measurement of formiminoglutamic acid
(FIGLU) urinary excretion after histidine load was used
formerly for assessing folate status but it is less specific
and less sensitive than the serum assays. Currently, there
are 3 tests used to detect folate deficiency—urinary
excretion of FIGLU, serum and red cell folate assay.
1. URINARY EXCRETION OF FIGLU. Folic acid is
required for conversion of formiminoglutamic acid
(FIGLU) to glutamic acid in the catabolism of histidine.
Thus, on oral administration of histidine, urinary excretion
of FIGLU is increased if folate deficiency is present.
2. SERUM FOLATE ASSAY. The folate in serum can be
estimated by 2 methods—microbiological assay and
radioassay.
i) Microbiological assay.  This test is based on the principle
that the serum folate acid activity is mainly due to the
presence of a folic acid co-enzyme, 5-methyl THF, and
that this compound is required for growth of the
microorganism, Lactobacillus casei. The growth of L. casei
is inhibited by addition of antibiotics.
ii) Radioassay. The principle and method of radioassay
by radioisotope dilution (RID) test are similar to that for
serum B12 assay. The test employs labelled pteroyl-
glutamic acid or methyl-THF. Commercial kits are
available which permit simultaneous assay of both
vitamin B12 and folate.
3. RED CELL FOLATE ASSAY. Red cells contain 20-50
times more folate than the serum; thus red cell folate assay
is more reliable indicator of tissue stores of folate than
serum folate assay. Microbiological radioassay and
protein-binding assay methods can be used for estimation

Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series
of red cell folate. Red cell folate values are decreased in
patients with megaloblastic anaemia as well as in patients
with pernicious anaemia.
Treatment
Most cases of megaloblastic anaemia need therapy with
appropriate vitamin. This includes: hydroxycobalamin as
intramuscular injection 1000 μg for 3 weeks and oral folic
acid 5 mg tablets daily for 4 months. Severely-anaemic
patients in whom a definite deficiency of either vitamin
cannot be established with certainty are treated with both
vitamins concurrently. Blood transfusion should be avoided
since it may cause circulatory overload. Packed cells may,
however, be infused slowly.
Treatment of megaloblastic anaemia is quite gratifying.
The marrow begins to revert back to normal morphology
within a few hours of initiating treatment and becomes
normoblastic within 48 hours of start of treatment. Reticulo-
cytosis appears within 4-5 days after therapy is started and
peaks at day 7. Haemoglobin should rise by 2-3 g/dl each
fortnight. The peripheral neuropathy may show some
improvement but subacute combined degeneration of the
spinal cord is irreversible.
PERNICIOUS ANAEMIA
Pernicious anaemia (PA) was first described by Addison in
1855 as a chronic disorder of middle-aged and elderly
individual of either sex in which intrinsic factor (IF) secretion
ceases owing to atrophy of the gastric mucosa. The condition
is, therefore, also termed Addisonian megaloblastic anaemia.
The average age at presentation is 60 years but rarely it can
be seen in children under 10 years of age (juvenile pernicious
anaemia). PA is seen most frequently in individuals of
northern European descent and African Americans and is
uncommon in South Europeans and Orientals.
Pathogenesis
There is evidence to suggest that the atrophy of gastric
mucosa in PA resulting in absence or low level of IF is caused
by an autoimmune reaction against gastric parietal cells. The
evidences in support of immunological abnormalities in
pernicious anaemia are as under:
1.
The incidence of PA is high in patients with other auto-
immune diseases such as Graves’ disease, myxoedema,
thyroiditis, vitiligo, diabetes and idiopathic adrenocortical
insufficiency.
2.
Patients with PA have abnormal circulating autoantibodies
such as anti-parietal cell antibody (90% cases) and anti-
intrinsic factor antibody (50% cases).
3.
Relatives of patients with PA have an increased incidence
of the disease or increased presence of autoantibodies.
4.
Corticosteroids have been reported to be beneficial in
curing the disease both pathologically and clinically.
5.
PA is more common in patients with agammaglobulinaemia
supporting the role of cellular immune system in destruction
of parietal cells.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The most characteristic
pathologic finding in PA is gastric atrophy affecting the
acid- and pepsin-secreting portion of the stomach and
sparing the antrum (Chapter 20). Gastric epithelium may
show cellular atypia. About 2-3% cases of PA develop
carcinoma of the stomach. Other pathologic changes are
secondary to vitamin B12 deficiency and include
megaloblastoid alterations in the gastric and intestinal
epithelium and neurologic abnormalities such as
peripheral neuropathy and spinal cord damage.
Clinical Features
The disease has insidious onset and progresses slowly. The
clinical manifestations are mainly due to vitamin B12
deficiency. These include: anaemia, glossitis, neurological
abnormalities (neuropathy, subacute combined degeneration
of the spinal cord, retrobulbar neuritis), gastrointestinal
manifestations (diarrhoea, anorexia, weight loss, dyspepsia),
hepatosplenomegaly, congestive heart failure and
haemorrhagic manifestations. Other autoimmune diseases
such as autoimmune thyroiditis may be associated.
Diagnostic Criteria
Since diagnosis of PA requires the patient to receive
lifelong parenteral B12 therapy, the diagnosis of PA is made
by combined clinical and laboratory evaluation as per
following diagnostic criteria:
I. Major criteria:
i)  Low serum B12 level in presence of normal renal function
ii) Megaloblastic anaemia in bone marrow examination,
which should not be due to folate deficiency
iii) Positive test for IF antibody
II. Minor laboratory criteria:
i)  Macrocytosis in PBF
ii)  Anaemia of variable degree
iii)  Hypergastrinaemia
iv)  Positive gastric parietal cell antibody
v)  Raised plasma homocysteine level
vi)  Gastric pH above 6
III. Minor clinical criteria:
i) Neurologic features of parasthaesia, numbness or ataxia
ii) Hypothyroidism
iii) Family history of PA or hypothyroidism
iv) Vitiligo
IV. Reference standard criteria:
i) Schilling test showing malabsorption of oral cyano-
cobalamin corrected by simultaneous administration of
IF.
Treatment
Patients of PA are treated with vitamin B12 in the following
way:
1.
Parenteral  vitamin B12 replacement therapy.
2.
Symptomatic and supportive therapy such as
physiotherapy for neurologic deficits and occasionally blood
transfusion.
3.
Follow-up for early detection of cancer of the stomach.

310
SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
Most of the abnormalities due to vitamin B12 deficiency
can be corrected except the irreversible damage to the spinal
cord. Corticosteroid therapy can improve the gastric lesion
with a return of acid secretion but the higher incidence of
gastric polyps and cancer of the stomach in these patients
can only be detected by frequent follow-up.
HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIAS
GENERAL ASPECTS
Definition and Classification
Haemolytic anaemias are defined as anaemias resulting from
an increase in the rate of red cell destruction. Normally, effete
red cells undergo lysis at the end of their lifespan of 120+30
days within the cells of reticuloendothelial (RE) system in
the spleen and elsewhere (extravascular haemolysis), and
haemoglobin is not liberated into the plasma in appreciable
amounts. The red cell lifespan is shortened in haemolytic
anaemia i.e. there is accelerated haemolysis. However,
shortening of red cell lifespan does not necessarily result in
anaemia. In fact, compensatory bone marrow hyperplasia
may cause 6 to 8-fold increase in red cell production without
causing anaemia to the patient, so-called compensated
haemolytic disease.
The premature destruction of red cells in haemolytic
anaemia may occur by 2 mechanisms:
Firstly, the red cells undergo lysis in the circulation and
release their contents into plasma (intravascular haemolysis).
In these cases the plasma haemoglobin rises substantially
and part of it may be excreted in the urine (haemoglobinuria).
Secondly, the red cells are taken up by cells of the RE
system where they are destroyed and digested (extravascular
haemolysis). In extravascular haemolysis, plasma
haemoglobin level is, therefore, barely raised.
Extravascular haemolysis is more common than the
former. One or more factors may be involved in the
pathogenesis of various haemolytic anaemias.
Haemolytic anaemias are broadly classified into 2 main
categories:
I.
Acquired haemolytic anaemias caused by a variety of
extrinsic environmental factors (extracorpuscular).
II. Hereditary haemolytic anaemias are usually the result of
intrinsic red cell defects (intracorpuscular).
A simplified classification based on these mechanisms is
given in Table 12.9 and diagrammatically represented in
Fig. 12.21.
Features of Haemolysis
A number of clinical and laboratory features are shared by
various types of haemolytic anaemias. These are briefly
described below:
GENERAL CLINICAL FEATURES.  Some of the general
clinical features common to most congenital and acquired
haemolytic anaemias are as under:
1.
Presence of pallor of mucous membranes.
2.
Positive family history with life-long anaemia in patients
with congenital haemolytic anaemia.
3.
Mild fluctuating jaundice due to unconjugated
hyperbilirubinaemia.
4.
Urine turns dark on standing due to excess of
urobilinogen in urine.
5.
Splenomegaly is found in most chronic haemolytic
anaemias, both congenital and acquired.
6.
Pigment gallstones are found in some cases.
LABORATORY EVALUATION OF HAEMOLYSIS.
Pathways by which haemoglobin derived from effete red cells
is metabolised is already discussed on page 290. The

CHAPTER 12
Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series
investigations of a patient suspected to have haemolytic
anaemia should provide answers to 3 vital questions:
1.
Is there evidence of haemolysis?
2.
What is the type of haemolytic mechanism?
3.
What is the precise diagnosis?
The laboratory findings are conveniently divided into the
following 4 groups:
I.
Tests of increased red cell breakdown:
1.
Serum bilirubin—unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin is
raised.
2.
Urine urobilinogen is raised but there is no bilirubinuria.
3.
Faecal stercobilinogen is raised.
4.
Serum haptoglobin (α-globulin binding protein) is reduced
or absent.
5.
Plasma lactic dehydrogenase is raised.
6.
Evidences of intravascular haemolysis in the form of haemo-
globinaemia, haemoglobinuria, methaemoglobinaemia and
haemosiderinuria.
II. Tests of increased red cell production:
1.
Reticulocyte count reveals reticulocytosis which is
generally early and is hence most useful initial test of marrow
erythroid hyperplasia.
2.
Routine blood film shows macrocytosis, polychromasia and
presence of normoblasts.
3.
Bone marrow shows erythroid hyperplasia with usually
raised iron stores.
4.
X-ray of bones shows evidence of expansion of marrow
space, especially in tubular bones and skull.
III. Tests of damage to red cells:
1.
Routine blood film shows a variety of abnormal
morphological appearances of red cells described on page
366 and illustrated in Fig.12.10  already. A summary of
contributory features of morphology of RBCs in arriving at
the diagnosis of haemolytic anaemia and its cause is given
in Table 12.10.
2.
Osmotic fragility is increased or decreased.
3.
Autohaemolysis test with or without addition of glucose.
4.
Coombs’ antiglobulin test.
5.
Electrophoresis for abnormal haemoglobins.
6.
Estimation of HbA2.
7.
Estimation of HbF.
8.
Tests for sickling.
9.
Screening test for G6PD deficiency and other enzymes (e.g.
Heinz bodies test).
IV.Tests for shortened red cell lifespan.  A shortened red
cell survival is best tested by 51Cr labelling method. Normal
RBC lifespan of 120 days is shortened to 20-40 days in
moderate haemolysis and to 5-20 days in severe haemolysis.

anaemia), mechanical factors (microangiopathic haemolytic
anaemia), direct toxic effect (in malaria, clostridial infection
etc), splenomegaly, and certain acquired membrane
abnormalities (paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria).
These are discussed below:
A. IMMUNOHAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIAS
Immunohaemolytic anaemias are a group of anaemias
occurring due to antibody production by the body against
its own red cells. Immune haemolysis in these cases may be
induced by one of the following three types of antibodies:
1.
Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) characterised by
formation of autoantibodies against patient’s own red cells.
Depending upon the reactivity of autoantibody, AIHA is
further divided into 2 types:
i)
‘Warm’ antibody AIHA in which the autoantibodies are
reactive at body temperature (37°C).
ii) ‘Cold’ antibody AIHA in which the autoantibodies react
better with patient’s own red cells at 4°C.
2.
Drug-induced immunohaemolytic anaemia.
3.
Isoimmune haemolytic anaemia in which the antibodies are
acquired by blood transfusions, pregnancies and haemolytic
disease of the newborn.
An important diagnostic tool in all cases of immuno-
haemolytic anaemias is Coombs’ antiglobulin test for
detection of incomplete Rh-antibodies in saline directly
(direct Coombs’) or after addition of albumin (indirect
Coombs’).
Autoimmune Haemolytic Anaemia (AIHA)
‘WARM’ ANTIBODY AIHA
PATHOGENESIS. Warm antibodies reactive at body
temperature and coating the red cells are generally IgG class
antibodies and occasionally they are IgA. Little is known
about the origin of these acquired red blood cell antibodies
in AIHA but the mechanism of destruction of red cells coated
with IgG is better understood. Human red cells coated with
IgG antibodies are bound to the surface of RE cells, especially
splenic macrophages. A part of the coated cell membrane is
lost resulting in spherical transformation of the red cells
(acquired spherocytosis). Red cells coated with IgG along
with C3 on the surface further promote this red cell-leucocyte
interaction, accounting for more severe haemolysis. The
spleen is particularly efficient in trapping red cells coated
with IgG antibodies. It is, thus, the major site of red cell
destruction in warm antibody AIHA.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Warm antibody AIHA may occur
at any age and in either sex. The disease may occur without
any apparent cause (idiopathic) but about a quarter of
patients develop this disorder as a complication of an
underlying disease affecting the immune system such as SLE,
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, lymphomas and certain
drugs such as methyl DOPA, penicillin etc (Table 12.11).
The disease tends to have remissions and relapses. The
usual clinical features are as follows:
1.
Chronic anaemia of varying severity with remissions and
relapses.
2.
Splenomegaly.
3.
Occasionally hyperbilirubinaemia.
Treatment of these cases consists of removal of the cause
whenever present, corticosteroid therapy, and in severe cases
blood transfusions. Splenectomy is the second line of therapy
in this disorder.
LABORATORY FINDINGS. The haematological and
biochemical findings in such cases are as under:
1. Mild to moderate chronic anaemia.
2. Reticulocytosis.
3. Prominent spherocytosis in the peripheral blood film.
4. Positive direct Coombs’ (antiglobulin) test for presence
of warm antibodies on the red cell, best detected at 37°C.
5. A positive indirect Coombs’ (antiglobulin) test at 37°C
may indicate presence of large quantities of warm
antibodies in the serum.
6. Unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinaemia.
7. Co-existent immune thrombocytopenia alongwith
occasional venous thrombosis may be present (termed
Evans’ syndrome).
8. In more severe cases, haemoglobinaemia and
haemoglobinuria may be present.
‘COLD’ ANTIBODY AIHA
PATHOGENESIS. Antibodies which are reactive in the cold
(4°C) may induce haemolysis under 2 conditions: cold
agglutinin disease and paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria.
1.
Cold agglutinin disease. In cold agglutinin disease, the
antibodies are IgM type which bind to the red cells best at
4°C. These cold antibodies are usually directed against the I
antigen on the red cell surface. Agglutination of red blood
cells by IgM cold agglutinins is most profound at very low
temperature but upon warming to 37°C or above,
disagglutination occurs quickly. Haemolytic effect is
mediated through fixation of C3 to the red blood cell surface
and not by agglutination alone. Most cold agglutinins affect
juvenile red blood cells.

Haemolytic Anaemia (AIHA).

313
CHAPTER 12
Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series
The etiology of cold antibody remains unknown. It is seen
in the course of certain infections (e.g. Mycoplasma
pneumonia, infectious mononucleosis) and in lymphomas.
2.
Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria (PCH). In PCH, cold
antibody is an IgG antibody (Donath-Landsteiner antibody)
which is directed against P blood group antigen and brings
about complement-mediated haemolysis. Attacks of PCH are
precipitated by exposure to cold.
PCH is uncommon and may be seen in association with
tertiary syphilis or as a complication of certain infections such
as Mycoplasma pneumonia, flu, measles and mumps.
CLINICAL FEATURES.  The clinical manifestations are due
to haemolysis and not due to agglutination. These include
the following:
1.
Chronic anaemia which is worsened by exposure to cold.
2.
Raynaud’s phenomenon.
3.
Cyanosis affecting the cold exposed regions such as tips
of nose, ears, fingers and toes.
4.
Haemoglobinaemia and haemoglobinuria occur on
exposure to cold.
Treatment consists of keeping the patient warm and
treating the underlying cause.
LABORATORY FINDINGS. The haematologic and
biochemical findings are somewhat similar to those found
in warm antibody AIHA except the thermal amplitude.
These findings are as follows:
1. Chronic anaemia.
2. Low reticulocyte count since young red cells are affected
more.
3. Spherocytosis is less marked.
4. Positive direct Coombs’ test for detection of C3 on the
red cell surface but IgM responsible for C3 coating on red
cells is not found.
5. The cold antibody titre is very high at 4°C and very low
at 37°C (Donath-Landsteiner test). IgM class cold antibody
has specificity for I antigen, while the rare IgG class
antibody of PCH has P blood group antigen specificity.
Drug-induced Immunohaemolytic Anaemia
Drugs may cause immunohaemolytic anaemia by 3 different
mechanisms:
1.
ααααα-METHYL DOPA TYPE ANTIBODIES. A small
proportion of patients receiving α-methyl dopa develop
immunohaemolytic anaemia which is identical in every
respect to warm antibody AIHA described above.
2.
PENICILLIN-INDUCED IMMUNOHAEMOLYSIS.
Patients receiving large doses of penicillin or penicillin-type
antibiotics develop antibodies against the red blood cell-drug
complex which induces haemolysis.
3.
INNOCENT BYSTANDER IMMUNOHAEMOLYSIS.
Drugs such as quinidine form a complex with plasma
proteins to which an antibody forms. This drug-plasma
protein-antibody complex may induce lysis of bystanding
red blood cells or platelets.
In each type of drug-induced immunohaemolytic
anaemia, discontinuation of the drug results in gradual
disappearance of haemolysis.
Isoimmune Haemolytic Anaemia
Isoimmune haemolytic anaemias are caused by acquiring
isoantibodies or alloantibodies by blood transfusions,
pregnancies and in haemolytic disease of the newborn. These
antibodies produced by one individual are directed against
red blood cells of the other. These conditions are considered
on page 340.
B. MICROANGIOPATHIC HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIA
Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia is caused by
abnormalities in the microvasculature. It is generally due to
mechanical trauma to the red cells in circulation and is
characterised by red cell fragmentation (schistocytosis). There
are 3 different ways by which microangiopathic haemolytic
anaemia results:
1.
EXTERNAL IMPACT.  Direct external trauma to red
blood cells when they pass through microcirculation, espe-
cially over the bony prominences, may cause haemolysis
during various activities e.g. in prolonged marchers, joggers,
karate players etc. These patients develop haemoglobi-
naemia, haemoglobinuria (march haemoglobinuria), and
sometimes myoglobinuria as a result of damage to muscles.
2.
CARDIAC HAEMOLYSIS.  A small proportion of
patients who received prosthetic cardiac valves or artificial
grafts develop haemolysis. This has been attributed to direct
mechanical trauma to the red cells or shear stress from
turbulent blood flow.
3.
FIBRIN DEPOSIT IN MICROVASCULATURE.
Deposition of fibrin in the microvasculature exposes the red
cells to physical obstruction and eventual fragmentation of
red cells and trapping of the platelets. Fibrin deposits in the
small vessels may occur in the following conditions:
i)
Abnormalities of the vessel wall e.g. in hypertension,
eclampsia, disseminated cancers, transplant rejection,
haemangioma etc.
ii) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
iii) Haemolytic-uraemic syndrome.
iv) Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
v) Vasculitis in collagen diseases.
All these conditions are described in relevant sections
separately.
C. HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIA FROM
DIRECT TOXIC EFFECTS
Haemolysis may result from direct toxic effects of certain
agents. These include the following examples:
1.
Malaria by direct parasitisation of red cells (black-water
fever) (Fig. 12.22).
2.
Bartonellosis by direct infection of red cells by the
microorganisms.
3.
Septicaemia with Clostridium welchii by damaging the red
cells.

SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
4.
Other microorganisms such as pneumococci, staphylococci
and Escherichia coli.
5.
Copper by direct haemolytic effect on red cells in Wilson’s
disease and patients on haemodialysis.
6.
Lead poisoning shows basophilic stippling of red blood
cells.
7.
Snake and spider bites cause haemolysis by their venoms.
8.
Extensive burns.
D. PAROXYSMAL NOCTURNAL
HAEMOGLOBINURIA (PNH)
PNH is a rare acquired disorder of red cell membrane in
which there is chronic intravascular haemolysis due to undue
sensitivity of red blood cells to complement due to defective
synthesis of a red cell membrane protein. The defect affects
all the cells of myeloid progenitor lineage (RBCs, WBCs,
platelets) suggesting a deficient haematopoiesis. The disorder
generally presents in adult life.
PATHOGENESIS. PNH is considered as an acquired clonal
disease of the cell membrane while normal clone also
continues to proliferate. The defect is a mutation in the stem
cells affecting myeloid progenitor cells that is normally
required for the biosynthesis of glycosyl phosphatidyl
inositol (GPI) essential for anchoring of the cell; the mutant
form of the gene is an X-linked gene called PIG-A
(phosphatidyl inositol glycan). Thus, as a result of mutation,
there is partial or complete deficiency of anchor protein. Out
of about 20 such proteins described so far, the lack of two of
the proteins—decay accelerating factor (DAF, CD55) and a
membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL, CD59), makes the
RBCs unduly sensitive to the lytic effect of complement.
CLINICAL AND LABORATORY FINDINGS.  Clinical
and laboratory findings are as under:
i)  Haemolytic anaemia.
ii) Pancytopenia (mild granulocytopenia and thrombo-
cytopenia frequent).
iii) Intermittent clinical haemoglobinuria; acute haemo-
lytic episodes occur at night identified by passage of
brown urine in the morning.
iv) Haemosiderinuria very common.
v) Venous thrombosis as a common complication.
The presence of inordinate sensitivity of red blood cells,
leucocytes and platelets to complement in PNH can be
demonstrated in vitro by Ham’s test using red cell lysis at
acidic pH or by sucrose haemolysis test.
About 20% cases of PNH may develop myeloproli-
ferative or myelodysplastic disorder and some even
develop acute myeloid leukaemia.
E. HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIA IN SPLENOMEGALY
Haemolytic anaemia is common in splenic enlargement from
any cause (Chapter 14). Normally, the spleen acts as a filter
and traps the damaged red blood cells, destroys them and
the splenic macrophages phagocytose the damaged red cells.
A normal spleen poses no risk to normal red blood cells. But
splenomegaly exaggerates the damaging effect to which the
red cells are exposed. Besides haemolytic anaemia,
splenomegaly is usually associated with pancytopenia.
Splenectomy or reduction in size of spleen by appropriate
therapy relieves the anaemia as well as improves the
leucocyte and platelet counts.
II. HEREDITARY (INTRACORPUSCULAR)
    HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIA
Hereditary haemolytic anaemias are usually the result of
intracorpuscular defects. Accordingly, they are broadly
classified into 2 groups (see Table 12.9):
Hereditary abnormalities of red cell membrane.
Hereditary disorders of the interior of the red cells.
A. HEREDITARY ABNORMALITIES OF
RED CELL MEMBRANE
The abnormalities of red cell membrane are readily identified
on blood film examination. There are 3 important types of
inherited red cell membrane defects: hereditary
spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis (hereditary
ovalocytosis) and hereditary stomatocytosis.
Hereditary Spherocytosis
Hereditary spherocytosis is a common type of hereditary
haemolytic anaemia of autosomal dominant inheritance in
which the red cell membrane is abnormal.
PATHOGENESIS. The molecular abnormality in hereditary
spherocytosis is a defect in proteins which anchor the lipid
bilayer to the underlying cytoskeleton. These protein
abnormalities are as under and are schematically illustrated
in Fig.12.23:
1. Spectrin deficiency. Almost all cases have deficiency in
the structural protein of the red cell membrane, spectrin.

CHAPTER 12
Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series
Spectrin deficiency correlates with the severity of anaemia.
Mutation in spectrin by recessive inheritance called α−spectrin
causes more severe form of anaemia, while mutation by
dominant inheritance forming β-spectrin results in mild form
of the disease.
2. Ankyrin abnormality.About half the cases of hereditary
spherocytosis have defect in ankyrin, protein that binds
protein 3 and spectrin. Homozygous state with recessive
inheritance pattern has severe anaemia while heterozygotes
with more common dominant inheritance pattern have
milder anaemia.
Inherited mutation in spectrin or ankyrin causes defect
in anchoring of lipid bilayer cell membrane. Red cells with
such unstable membrane but with normal volume, when
released in circulation, lose their membrane further, till they
can accommodate the given volume. This results in formation
of spheroidal contour and smaller size of red blood cells,
termed microspherocytes. These deformed red cells are not
flexible, unlike normal biconcave red cells. These rigid cells
are unable to pass through the spleen, and in the process
they lose their surface membrane further. This produces a
subpopulation of hyperspheroidal red cells in the peripheral
blood which are subsequently destroyed in the spleen.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The disorder may be clinically
apparent at any age from infancy to old age and has equal
sex incidence. The family history may be present. The major
clinical features are as under:
1.
Anaemia is usually mild to moderate.
2.
Splenomegaly is a constant feature.
3.
Jaundice occurs due to increased concentration of
unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin in the plasma (also termed
congenital haemolytic jaundice).
4.
Pigment gallstones are frequent due to increased bile
pigment production. Splenectomy offers the only reliable
mode of treatment.
LABORATORY FINDINGS. The usual haematological
and biochemical findings are as under:
1. Anaemia of mild to moderate degree.
2. Reticulocytosis, usually 5-20%.
3. Blood film shows the characteristic abnormality of
erythrocytes in the form of microspherocytes (Fig.12.24).
4. MCV is usually normal or slightly decreased but MCHC
is increased.
5. Osmotic fragility test is helpful in testing the spheroidal
nature of red cells which lyse more readily in solutions of
low salt concentration i.e. osmotic fragility is increased
(Fig.12.25).
6. Autohaemolysis test is similar to osmotic fragility test after
incubation and shows increased spontaneous
autohaemolysis (10-15% red cells) as compared to normal
red cells (less than 4%). Autohaemolysis is correctable by
addition of glucose.
7. Direct Coombs’ (antiglobulin) test is negative so as to
distinguish this condition from acquired spherocytosis of
AIHA in which case it is positive.
Spherocytes may also be seen in blood film in acquired
immune haemolytic anaemia and following red cell
transfusion.
Hereditary Elliptocytosis (Hereditary Ovalocytosis)
Hereditary elliptocytosis or hereditary ovalocytosis is another
autosomal dominant disorder involving red cell membrane
protein spectrin. Some patients have an inherited defect in
erythrocyte membrane protein 4.1 that interconnects spectrin
with actin in the cytoskeleton. The disorder is similar in all
respects to hereditary spherocytosis except that the blood
film shows oval or elliptical red cells and is clinically a milder
disorder than hereditary spherocytosis.
Acquired causes of elliptocytosis include iron deficiency
and myeloproliferative disorders.

size. B, Red cell membrane as seen in cross section in hereditary spherocytosis. Mutations in membrane proteins—α-spectrin, β-spectrin and
ankyrin, result in defect in anchoring of  lipid bilayer of the membrane to the underlying cytoskeleton. C, This results in spherical contour and small
size so as to contain the given volume of haemoglobin in the deformed red cell. D, During passage  through the spleen, these rigid spherical cells
lose their cell membrane further. This produces a circulating subpopulation of hyperspheroidal spherocytes while splenic macrophages in large
numbers phagocytose defective red cells causing splenomegaly.

asymptomatic. Several variants of G6PD have been
described. The normal G6PD variant is designated as type B
but blacks have normally A+ (positive) type G6PD variant.
The most common and significant clinical variant is A–
(negative) type found in black males. Like the HbS gene, the
A–type G6PD variant confers protection against malaria.
Individuals with A– G6PD variant have shortened red cell
lifespan but without anaemia. However, these individuals
develop haemolytic episodes on exposure to oxidant stress
such as viral and bacterial infections, certain drugs
(antimalarials, sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, aspirin, vitamin
K), metabolic acidosis and on ingestion of fava beans
(favism).
PATHOGENESIS. Normally, red blood cells are well
protected against oxidant stress because of adequate
generation of reduced glutathione via the hexose mono-
phosphate shunt. Individuals with inherited deficiency of
G6PD, an enzyme required for hexose monophosphate
shunt for glucose metabolism, fail to develop adequate
levels of reduced glutathione in their red cells. This results
Figure 12.24
Peripheral blood film findings in hereditary spherocytosis.
Figure 12.25

showing increased fragility.
Hereditary Stomatocytosis
Stomatocytes are cup-shaped RBCs having one surface
concave and the other side as convex. This causes a central
slit-like or mouth-like appearance of red cells. The underlying
defect is in membrane protein, stomatin, having autosomal
dominant pattern of inheritance. The stomatocytes are
swollen red cells (overhydrated red cells) due to increased
permeability to sodium and potassium. The affected patients
have mild anaemia and splenomegaly.
B. HEREDITARY DISORDERS OF RED CELL INTERIOR
Inherited disorders involving the interior of the red blood
cells are classified into 2 groups:
1.
Red cell enzyme defects (Enzymopathies): These cause
defective red cell metabolism involving 2 pathways
(Fig. 12.26):
i)
Defects in the hexose monophosphate shunt: Common
example is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
deficiency.
ii) Defects in the Embden-Meyerhof (glycolytic) pathway:
Example is pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency.
2.
Disorders of haemoglobin (haemoglobinopathies):
These are divided into 2 subgroups:
i) Structurally abnormal haemoglobin: Examples are sickle
syndromes and other haemoglobinopathies.
ii) Reduced globin chain synthesis: Common examples are
various types of thalassaemias.
These disorders are discussed below.
Red Cell Enzyme Defects (Enzymopathies)
G6PD DEFICIENCY
Among the defects in hexose monophosphate shunt, the most
common is G6PD deficiency. It affects millions of people
throughout the world. G6PD gene is located on the X
chromosome and its deficiency is, therefore, a sex (X)-linked
trait affecting males, while the females are carriers and are

317
CHAPTER 12
Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series
in oxidation and precipitation of haemoglobin within the
red cells forming Heinz bodies. Besides G6PD deficiency,
deficiency of various other enzymes involved in the hexose
monophosphate shunt may also infrequently cause clinical
problems.
CLINICAL FEATURES.  The clinical manifestations are those
of an acute haemolytic anaemia within hours of exposure to
oxidant stress. The haemolysis is, however, self-limiting even
if the exposure to the oxidant is continued since it affects the
older red cells only. Haemoglobin level may return to normal
when the older population of red cells has been destroyed
and only younger cells remain. Some patients may have only
darkening of the urine from haemoglobinuria but more
severely affected ones develop constitutional symptoms
including jaundice. Treatment is directed towards the
prevention of haemolytic episodes such as stoppage of
offending drug. Blood transfusions are rarely indicated.
LABORATORY FINDINGS. These are as under:
1.During the period of acute haemolysis, there is rapid
fall in haematocrit by 25-30%, features of intravascular
haemolysis such as rise in plasma haemoglobin,
haemoglobinuria, rise in unconjugated bilirubin and fall
in plasma haptoglobin. Formation of Heinz bodies is
visualised by means of supravital stains such as crystal
violet, also called Heinz body haemolytic anaemia. However,
Heinz bodies are not seen after the first one or two days
since they are removed by the spleen, leading to formation
of ‘bite cells’ and fragmented red cells.
2. Between the crises, the affected patient generally has
no anaemia. The red cell survival is, however, shortened.
The diagnosis of G6PD enzyme deficiency is made by
one of the screening tests (e.g. methaemoglobin reduction
test, fluorescent screening test, ascorbate cyanide
screening test), or by direct enzyme assay on red cells.
PK DEFICIENCY
Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is the only significant
enzymopathy of the Embden-Meyerhof glycolytic
pathway.The disorder is inherited as an autosomal recessive
pattern. Heterozygote state is entirely asymptomatic, while
the homozygous individual presents during early childhood
with anaemia, jaundice and splenomegaly.
LABORATORY FINDINGS: These are as under:
1. Normocytic and normochromic anaemia.
2. Reticulocytosis.
3. Blood film shows bizarre red cells.
4.  Osmotic fragility is usually normal but after incubation
it is increased.
5. Autohaemolysis is increased, but unlike hereditary
spherocytosis, is not corrected by addition of glucose.
6. Direct specific enzyme assay on red cells is the only
method of establishing the diagnosis.
Haemoglobinopathies
Haemoglobin in RBCs may be abnormally synthesised due
to inherited defects. These disorders may be of two types:
Qualitative disorders in which there is structural
abnormality in synthesis of haemoglobin e.g. sickle cell
syndrome, other haemoglobinopathies.
Quantitative disorders in which there quantitatively
decreased globin chain synthesis of haemoglobin e.g.
thalassaemias.
Both these groups of disorders may occur as homozygous
state in which both genes coding for that character are
abnormal, or heterozygous when one gene is abnormal and
the other gene is normal. However, there are examples of
combined disorders too in which there are two different
mutations in loci of two corresponding genes (i.e. double
heterozygous) e.g. HbS gene from one parent and β-thal from
the other parent resulting in βSβthal. These disorders may vary

in presentation from asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities
to intrauterine death.
There are geographic variations in the distribution of
various haemoglobinopathies world over as shown in
Fig. 12.27.  Major examples of these disorders are described
below.
STRUCTURALLY ABNORMAL HAEMOGLOBINS
SICKLE SYNDROMES
The most important and widely prevalent type of haemo-
globinopathy is due to the presence of sickle haemoglobin
(HbS) in the red blood cells. The red cells with HbS develop
‘sickling’ when they are exposed to low oxygen tension.
Sickle syndromes have the highest frequency in black race
and in Central Africa where falciparum malaria is endemic.
Patients with HbS are relatively protected against falciparum
malaria. Sickle syndromes occur in 3 different forms:
1.
As heterozygous state for HbS: sickle cell trait (AS).
2.
As homozygous state for HbS: sickle cell anaemia (SS).
3.
As double heterozygous states e.g. sickle β-thalassaemia,
sickle-C disease (SC), sickle-D disease (SD).
Heterozygous State:Sickle Cell Trait
Sickle cell trait (AS) is a benign heterozygous state of HbS in
which only one abnormal gene is inherited. Patients with
AS develop no significant clinical problems except when they
become severely hypoxic and may develop sickle cell crises.
LABORATORY FINDINGS. These patients have no
anaemia and have normal appearance of red cells. But in
hypoxic crisis, sickle cell crises develop. The diagnosis is
made by 2 tests:
1. Demonstration of sickling done under condition of
reduced oxygen tension by an oxygen consuming reagent,
sodium metabisulfite.
2. Haemoglobin electrophoresis reveals 35-40% of the total
haemoglobin as HbS.
Homozygous State:Sickle Cell Anaemia
Sickle cell anaemia (SS) is a homozygous state of HbS in the
red cells in which an abnormal gene is inherited from each
parent. SS is a severe disorder associated with protean clinical
manifestations and decreased life expectancy.
PATHOGENESIS. Following abnormalities are observed
(Fig. 12.28):
1.Basic molecular lesion: In HbS, basic genetic defect is the
single point mutation in one amino acid out of 146 in
haemoglobin molecule— there is substitution of valine for
glutamic acid at 6-residue position of the β-globin, producing
Hb α2β2
s.

globinopathies and thalassaemias. Thalassaemia and HbD are the

cells containing HbS. C, Mechanism of sickling on oxygenation-deoxygenation.

319
CHAPTER 12
Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series
2.Mechanism of sickling: During deoxygenation, the red
cells containing HbS change from biconcave disc shape to
an elongated crescent-shaped or sickle-shaped cell. This
process termed sickling occurs both within the intact red cells
and in vitro in free solution. The mechanism responsible for
sickling upon deoxygenation of HbS-containing red cells is
the polymerisation of deoxygenated HbS which aggregates
to form elongated rod-like polymers. These elongated fibres
align and distort the red cell into classic sickle shape.
3. Reversible-irreversible sickling: The oxygen-dependent
sickling process is usually reversible. However, damage to
red cell membrane leads to formation of irreversibly sickled
red cells even after they are exposed to normal oxygen
tension.
4.Factors determining rate of sickling: Following factors
determine the rate at which the polymerisation of HbS and
consequent sickling take place:
i) Presence of non-HbS haemoglobins: The red cells in patients
of SS have predominance of HbS and a small part consists of
non-HbS haemoglobins, chiefly HbF (2-20% of the total
haemoglobin). HbF-containing red cells are protected from
sickling while HbA-containing red cells participate readily
in co-polymerisation with HbS.
ii) Intracellular concentration of HbS.
iii) Total haemoglobin concentration.
iv) Extent of deoxygenation.
v) Acidosis and dehydration.
vi) Increased concentration of 2, 3-BPG in the red cells.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The clinical manifestations of homo-
zygous sickle cell disease are widespread. The symptoms
begin to appear after 6th month of life when most of the HbF
is replaced by HbS. Infection and folic acid deficiency result
in more severe clinical manifestations. These features are as
under:
1.
Anaemia. There is usually severe chronic haemolytic
anaemia (primarily extravascular) with onset of aplastic crisis
in between. The symptoms of anaemia are generally mild
since HbS gives up oxygen more readily than HbA to the
tissues.
2.
Vaso-occlusive phenomena.  Patients of SS develop
recurrent vaso-occlusive episodes throughout their lives due
to obstruction to capillary blood flow by sickled red cells
upon deoxygenation or dehydration. Vaso-obstruction
affecting different organs and tissues results in infarcts which
may be of 2 types:
i)
Microinfarcts affecting particularly the abdomen, chest,
back and joints and are the cause of recurrent painful crises
in SS.
ii) Macroinfarcts involving most commonly the spleen
(splenic sequestration, autosplenectomy), bone marrow
(pains), bones (aseptic necrosis, osteomyelitis), lungs
(pulmonary infections), kidneys (renal cortical necrosis), CNS
(stroke), retina (damage) and skin (ulcers), and result in
anatomic and functional damage to these organs.
3.
Constitutional symptoms. In addition to the features of
anaemia and infarction, patients with SS have impaired
growth and development and increased susceptibility to
infection due to markedly impaired splenic function.
LABORATORY FINDINGS. The diagnosis of SS is
considered high in blacks with haemolytic anaemia. The
laboratory findings in these cases are as under (Fig. 12.29):
1. Moderate to severe anaemia (haemoglobin concen-
tration 6-9 g/dl).
2. The blood film shows sickle cells and target cells and
features of splenic atrophy such as presence of Howell-
Jolly bodies.
3. A positive sickling test with a reducing substance such
as sodium metabisulfite (described above).
4. Haemoglobin electrophoresis shows no normal HbA
but shows predominance of HbS and 2-20% HbF.
Double Heterozygous States
Double heterozygous conditions involving combination of
HbS with other haemoglobinopathies may occur. Most
common among these are sickle-β-thalassaemia (βSβthal),
sickle C disease (SC), and sickle D disease (SD). All these
disorders behave like mild form of sickle cell disease. Their
diagnosis is made by haemoglobin electrophoresis and
separating the different haemoglobins.
OTHER STRUCTURAL HAEMOGLOBINOPATHIES
Besides sickle haemoglobin, about 400 structurally different
abnormal human haemoglobins have been discovered in
different parts of the world. Some of them are associated with
clinical manifestations, while others are of no consequence.
A few important and common variants are briefly described
below:
HbC Haemoglobinopathy
HbC haemoglobinopathy is prevalent in West Africa and in
American blacks. The molecular lesion in HbC is substitution
of lysine for glutamic acid at β-6 globin chain position. The
Figure 12.29

elongated red blood cells, a few target cells and a few erythroblasts.

320
SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
disorder of HbC may occur as benign homozygous HbC
disease, or as asymptomatic heterozygous HbC trait, or as
double heterozygous combinations such as sickle-HbC
disease and HbC-β thalassaemia.
HbD Haemoglobinopathy
HbD occurs in North-West India, Pakistan and Iran. About
3% of Sikhs living in Punjab are affected with HbD
haemoglobinopathy (called HbD Punjab, also known as Hb-
Los Angeles). HbD Punjab arises from the substitution of
glutamine for glutamic acid at β-121 globin chain position.
HbE Haemoglobinopathy
HbE is predominantly found in South-East Asia, India,
Burma and Sri Lanka. HbE arises from the substitution of
lysine for glutamic acid at β-26 globin chain position. Like
other abnormal haemoglobins, HbE haemoglobinopathy may
also occur as asymptomatic heterozygous HbE trait,
compensated haemolytic homozygous HbE disease, or as
double heterozygous states in combination with other
haemoglobinopathies such as HbE-β thalassaemia and HbE-
α thalassaemia.
Haemoglobin O-Arab Disease
Hb O-Arab disease was first identified in an Arab family
but has now been detected in American blacks too. The
homozygous form of the disease appears as mild haemolytic
anaemia with splenomegaly.
Unstable-Hb Haemoglobinopathy
The unstable haemoglobins are those haemoglobin variants
which undergo denaturation and precipitation within the red
cells as Heinz bodies. These give rise to what is known as
congenital non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia or congenital
Heinz body haemolytic anaemia. These disorders have either
autosomal dominant inheritance or develop from sponta-
neous mutations. The unstable haemoglobins arise from
either a single amino acid substitution in the globin chain or
due to deletion of one or more amino acids within the β-
globin chain so that the firm bonding of the haem group
within the molecule is disturbed leading to formation of
methaemoglobin and precipitation of globin chains as Heinz
bodies.
Over 100 unstable haemoglobins have been described.
They are named according to the place where they are
encountered. For instance: Hb-Koln, Hb-Hammersmith, Hb-
Zurich, Hb-Sydney, and so on. The diagnosis of unstable Hb
disease is made by test for Heinz bodies and by haemoglobin
electrophoresis.
REDUCED GLOBIN CHAIN SYNTHESIS:
THALASSAEMIAS
DEFINITION
The thalassaemias are a diverse group of hereditary disorders
in which there is reduced synthesis of one or more of the
globin polypeptide chains. Thus, thalassaemias, unlike
haemoglobinopathies which are qualitative disorders of
haemoglobin, are quantitative abnormalities of polypeptide globin
chain synthesis. Thalassaemias were first described in people
of Mediterranean countries (North Africa, Southern Europe)
from where it derives its name ‘Mediterranean anaemia.’ The
Word ‘thalassa’ in Greek means ‘the sea’ since the condition
was found commonly in regions surrounding the
Mediterranean sea. The condition also occurs in the Middle
East, Indian subcontinent, South-East Asia and, in general
in blacks (see Fig. 12.27).
GENETICS AND CLASSIFICATION
Thalassaemias are genetically transmitted disorders.
Normally, an individual inherits two β-globin genes located
one each on two chromosomes 11, and two α-globin genes
one each on two chromosomes 16, from each parent i.e.
normal adult haemoglobin (HbA) is α2 β2*. Depending upon
whether the genetic defect or deletion lies in transmission of
α- or β-globin chain genes, thalassaemias are classified into
α- and β- thalassaemias. Thus, patients with α-thalassaemia
have structurally normal α-globin chains but their production
is impaired. Similarly, in β-thalassaemia, β-globin chains are
structurally normal but their production is decreased. Each
of the two main types of thalassaemias may occur as
heterozygous (called α- and β-thalassaemia minor or trait), or
as homogygous state (termed α- and β-thalassaemia major).
The former is generally asymptomatic, while the latter is a
severe congenital haemolytic anaemia.
A classification of various types of thalassaemias
alongwith the clinical syndromes produced and salient
laboratory findings are given in Table 12.12.
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF ANAEMIA IN
THALASSAEMIA
A constant feature of all forms of thalassaemia is the presence
of anaemia which occurs from following mechanisms:
α-Thalassaemia: In α-thalassaemia major, the obvious cause
of anaemia is the inability to synthesise adult haemoglobin,
while in α-thalassaemia trait there is reduced production of
normal adult haemoglobin.
β-Thalassaemia: In β-thalassaemia major, the most impor-
tant cause of anaemia is premature red cell destruction
brought about by erythrocyte membrane damage caused by
the precipitated α-globin chains. Other contributory factors
are: shortened red cell lifespan, ineffective erythropoiesis,
and haemodilution due to increased plasma volume. A
deficiency of β-globin chains in β-thalassaemia leads to large
excess of α-chains within the developing red cells. Part of
these excessive α-chains are removed by pairing with γ-globin
chains as HbF, while the remainder unaccompanied α-chains
precipitate rapidly within the red cell as Heinz bodies. The
precipitated α-chains cause red cell membrane damage.
During their passage through the splenic sinusoids, these
red cells are further damaged and develop pitting due to
removal of the precipitated aggregates. Thus, such red cells
*In a normal adult, distribution of haemoglobin is as under: HbA (α2β2 )
= 95-98%, HbA2 (α2δ2) (a minor variant of HbA) = 1.5-3.5%, HbF (α2 γ2) =
less than 1%.  But the level of HbF in children under 6 months is slightly
higher.

321
CHAPTER 12
Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series
are irreparably damaged and are phagocytosed by the RE
cells of the spleen and the liver causing anaemia, hepato-
splenomegaly, and excess of tissue iron stores. Patients with
β-thalassaemia minor, on the other hand, have very mild
ineffective erythropoiesis, haemolysis and shortening of red
cell lifespan.
ααααα-THALASSAEMIA
MOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS. α-thalassaemias are
disorders in which there is defective synthesis of α-globin
chains resulting in depressed production of haemoglobins
that contain α-chains i.e. HbA, HbA2 and HbF. The α-
thalassaemias are most commonly due to deletion of one or
more of the α-chain genes located on short arm of chromo-
some 16. Since there is a pair of α-chain genes, the clinical
manifestations of α-thalassaemia depend upon the number
of genes deleted. Accordingly, α-thalassaemias are classified
into 4 types:
1.
Four α-gene deletion: Hb Bart’s hydrops foetalis.
2.
Three α-gene deletion: HbH disease.
3.
Two α-gene deletion: α-thalassaemia trait.
4.
One α-gene deletion: α-thalassaemia trait (carrier).
Hb Bart’s Hydrops Foetalis
When there is deletion of all the four α-chain genes
(homozygous state) it results in total suppression of α-globin
chain synthesis causing the most severe form of α-
thalassaemia called Hb Bart’s hydrops foetalis. Hb Bart’s is
a gamma globin chain tetramer (γ4) which has high oxygen
affinity leading to severe tissue hypoxia.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Hb Bart’s hydrops foetalis is
incompatible with life due to severe tissue hypoxia. The
condition is either fatal in utero or the infant dies shortly after
birth. If born alive, the features similar to severe Rh
haemolytic disease are present (page 340).
LABORATORY FINDINGS. Infants with Hb Bart’s
hydrops foetalis born alive may have the following
laboratory findings:
1.
Severe anaemia (haemoglobin below 6g/dl).
2.
Blood film show marked anisopoikilocytosis,
hypochromia, microcytosis, polychromasia, basophilic
stippling, numerous normoblasts and target cells.
3.
Reticulocyte count is high.
4.
Serum bilirubin level is elevated.
5.
Haemoglobin electrophoresis shows 80-90% Hb-Bart’s
and a small amount of Hb-H and Hb-Portland but no
HbA, HbA2 or HbF.
HbH Disease
Deletion of three α-chain genes produces HbH which is a β-
globin chain tetramer (β4) and markedly impaired α-chain
synthesis. HbH is precipitated as Heinz bodies within the
affected red cells. An elongated α-chain variant of HbH
disease is termed Hb Constant Spring.
CLINICAL FEATURES. HbH disease is generally present
as a well-compensated haemolytic anaemia. The features are
intermediate between that of β-thalassaemia minor and
major. The severity of anaemia fluctuates and may fall to
very low levels during pregnancy or infections. Majority of
patients have splenomegaly and may develop cholelithiasis.
LABORATORY FINDINGS. These are as follows:
1.
Moderate anaemia (haemoglobin 8-9 g/dl).
2.
Blood film shows severe microcytosis, hypochromia,
basophilic stippling, target cells and normoblasts.
3.
Mild reticulocytosis.
4.
HbH inclusions as Heinz bodies can be demonstrated
in mature red cells with brilliant cresyl blue stain.
5.
Haemoglobin electrophoresis shows 2-4% HbH and
the remainder consists of HbA, HbA2 and HbF.
ααααα-Thalassaemia Trait
α-thalassaemia trait may occur by the following molecular
pathogenesis:
By deletion of two of the four α-chain genes in
homozygous form called homozygous α-thalassaemia, or in
double heterozygous form termed heterozygous α-thalassaemia.

By deletion of a single α-chain gene causing heterozygous
α-thalassaemia trait called heterozygous α-thalassaemia.
CLINICAL FEATURES. α-thalassaemia trait due to two
α-chain gene deletion is asymptomatic. It is suspected in a
patient of refractory microcytic hypochromic anaemia in
whom iron deficiency and β-thalassaemia minor have been
excluded and the patient belongs to the high-risk ethnic
group. One gene deletion α-thalassaemia trait is a silent
carrier state.
LABORATORY FINDINGS. The patients of α-thalas-
saemia trait may have the following haematological
findings:
1. Haemoglobin level normal or mildly reduced.
2. Blood film shows microcytic and hypochromic red cell
morphology but no evidence of haemolysis or anaemia.
3. MCV, MCH and MCHC may be slightly reduced.
4. Haemoglobin electrophoresis reveals small amount of
Hb-Bart’s in neonatal period (1-2% in α-thalassaemia 2
and 5-6% in α-thalassaemia 1) which gradually disappears
by adult life. HbA2 is either normal or slightly decreased
(contrary to the elevated HBA2 levels in β-thalassaemia
trait).
βββββ-THALASSAEMIAS
MOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS.  β-thalassaemias are
caused by decreased rate of β-chain synthesis resulting in
reduced formation of HbA in the red cells. The molecular
pathogenesis of the β-thalassaemias is more complex than
that of α-thalassaemias. In contrast to α-thalassaemia, gene
deletion rarely ever causes β-thalassaemia and is only seen
in an entity called hereditary persistence of foetal haemoglobin
(HPFH). Instead, most of β-thalassaemias arise from different
types of mutations of β−globin gene resulting from single
base changes. The symbol β° is used to indicate the complete
absence of β-globin chain synthesis while β+ denotes partial
synthesis of the β-globin chains. More than 100 such
mutations have been described affecting the preferred sites
in the coding sequences e.g. in promoter region, termination
region, splice junctions, exons, introns. Some of the important
ones having effects on β-globin chain synthesis are as under
(Fig. 12.30):
i) Transcription defect: Mutation affecting transcriptional
promoter sequence causing reduced synthesis of β-globin
chain. Hence the result is partially preserved synthesis i.e.
β+ thalassaemia.
ii) Translation defect: Mutation in the coding sequence causing
stop codon (chain termination) interrupting β-globin
messenger RNA. This would result in no synthesis of β-globin
chain i.e. β° thalassaemia.
iii) mRNA splicing defect: Mutation leads to defective mRNA
processing forming abnormal mRNA that is degraded in the
nucleus. Depending upon whether part of splice site remains
intact or is totally degraded, it may result in β+ thalassaemia
or β° thalassaemia.
Depending upon the extent of reduction in β-chain
synthesis, there are 3 types of β-thalassaemia:
1.
Homozygous form: β-Thalassaemia major. It is the most
severe form of congenital haemolytic anaemia. It is further
of 2 types (Fig. 12.31):
i)
β° thalassaemia major characterised by complete absence
of β-chain synthesis.
ii) β+ thalassaemia major having incomplete suppression of
β-chain synthesis.
2.
β-Thalassaemia intermedia: It is β-thalassaemia of
intermediate degree of severity that does not require regular
blood transfusions. These cases are genetically heterozygous
(β°/β or β+/β).
3.
Heterozygous form: β-Thalassaemia minor (trait). It is
a mild asymptomatic condition in which there is moderate
suppression of β-chain synthesis.
Besides β-thalassaemia minor, a few uncommon globin
chain combinations resulting in β-thalassaemia trait are as
under:
i)
δβ-thalassaemia minor in which there is total absence of
both β and δ chain synthesis and is characterised by elevated
HbF level but unlike β-thalassaemia minor there is normal
or reduced HbA2 level.

CHAPTER 12
Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series
ii) Hb Lepore syndrome characterised by nonhomologous
fusion of β- and δ-genes forming an abnormal haemoglobin
called Hb Lepore (named after a family called Lepore). There
is total absence of normal β-chain synthesis.
An individual may inherit one β-chain gene from each
parent and produce heterozygous, homozygous, or double
heterozygous states. Statistically, 25% of offsprings born to
two heterozygotes (i.e. β-thalassaemia trait) will have the
homozygous state i.e. β-thalassaemia major.
βββββ-Thalassaemia Major
β-thalassaemia major, also termed Mediterranean or Cooley’s
anaemia is the most common form of congenital haemolytic
anaemia. β-thalassaemia major is a homozygous state with
either complete absence of β-chain synthesis (β° thalassaemia
major) or only small amounts of β-chains are formed (β+ thalas-
saemia major). These result in excessive formation of alternate
haemoglobins, HbF (α2 γ2) and HbA2 (α2 δ2).
CLINICAL FEATURES. Clinical manifestations appear
insidiously and are as under (Fig. 12.32):
1.
Anaemia starts appearing within the first 4-6 months of
life when the switch over from γ-chain to β-chain production
occurs.
2.
Marked hepatosplenomegaly occurs due to excessive red
cell destruction, extramedullary haematopoiesis and iron
overload.
3.
Expansion of bones occurs due to marked erythroid
hyperplasia leading to thalassaemic facies and malocclusion
of the jaw.
4.
Iron overload due to repeated blood transfusions causes
damage to the endocrine organs resulting in slow rate of
growth and development, delayed puberty, diabetes mellitus
and damage to the liver and heart.
LABORATORY FINDINGS. The haematological
investigations reveal the following findings:
1. Anaemia, usually severe.
2. Blood film shows severe microcytic hypochromic red cell
morphology, marked anisopoikilocytosis, basophilic
stippling, presence of many target cells, tear drop cells
and normoblasts (Fig. 12.33).
3. Serum bilirubin (unconjugated) is generally raised.
4. Reticulocytosis is generally present.
5. MCV, MCH and MCHC are significantly reduced.
6. WBC count is often raised with some shift to left of the
neutrophil series, with presence of some myelocytes and
metamyelocytes.

SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
7. Platelet count is usually normal but may be reduced in
patients with massive splenomegaly.
8. Osmotic fragility characteristically reveals increased
resistance to saline haemolysis i.e. decreased osmotic fragility
(Fig. 12.34).
9. Haemoglobin electrophoresis shows presence of increased
amounts of HbF, increased amount of HbA2, and almost
complete absence or presence of variable amounts of HbA.
The increased level of HbA2 has not been found in any
other haemoglobin abnormality except β-thalassaemia.
The increased synthesis of HbA2 is probably due to
increased activity at both δ-chain loci.
10. Bone marrow aspirate examination shows normoblastic
erythroid hyperplasia with predominance of intermediate
and late normoblasts which are generally smaller in size
than normal. Iron staining demonstrates siderotic granules
in the cytoplasm of normoblasts, increased reticuloendo-
thelial iron but ring sideroblasts are only occasionally seen.
Treatment
Treatment of β-thalassaemia major is largely supportive.
1.
Anaemia is generally severe and patients require regular
blood transfusions (4-6 weekly) to maintain haemoglobin
above 8 g/dl.
2.
In order to maintain increased demand of hyperplastic
marrow, folic acid supplement is given.
3.
Splenectomy is beneficial in children over 6 years of age
since splenic sequestration contributes to shortened red cell
lifespan.
4.
Prevention and treatment of iron overload is done by
chelation therapy (desferrioxamine). Oral chelation with
kelfer or deferiprone is also available now.
5.
Bone marrow transplantation from HLA-matched donor
that provides stem cells which can form normal haemoglobin
is being done in many centres with fair success rate, especially
when done at an early stage before end-organ damage has
supervened..
6. Some workers have found success with cord blood
transfusion.
7. Gene therapy of thalasaemia involving genetic
manipulation in haematopoieitc stem cells may become an
option  for future.
Since these patients require multiple blood transfusions,
they are at increased risk of developing AIDS. In general,
patients with β-thalassaemia major have short life
expectancy. The biggest problem is iron overload and conse-
quent myocardial siderosis leading to cardiac arrhythmias,
congestive heart failure, and ultimately death.
βββββ-Thalassaemia Minor
The β-thalassaemia minor or β-thalassaemia trait, a
heterozygous state, is a common entity characterised by
moderate reduction in β-chain synthesis.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Clinically, the condition is usually
asymptomatic and the diagnosis is generally made when the
patient is being investigated for mild chronic anaemia. The
spleen may be palpable.
LABORATORY FINDINGS. These are as under:
1. Mild anaemia; mean haemoglobin level is about 15%
lower than in normal person for the age and sex.
2. Blood film shows mild anisopoikilocytosis, microcytosis
and hypochromia, occasional target cells and basophilic
stippling.
3. Serum bilirubin may be normal or slightly raised.
4. Mild reticulocytosis is often present.
5. MCV, MCH and MCHC may be slightly reduced.
6. Osmotic fragility test shows increased resistance to
haemolysis i.e. decreased osmotic fragility.
7. Haemoglobin electrophoresis is confirmatory for the
diagnosis and shows about two-fold increase in HbA2 and
a slight elevation in HbF (2-3%).
Treatment
Patients with β-thalassaemia minor do not require any
treatment. But they should be explained about the genetic
implications of the disorder, particularly to those of child-
bearing age. If the two subjects of β-thalassaemia trait marry,
there is a 25% chance of developing thalassaemia major in
offsprings. Patients with β-thalassaemia minor have normal
life expectancy but those who are treated under the mistaken
diagnosis of iron deficiency may develop siderosis and its
complications.
Prevention of Thalassaemia
Finally, since thalassaemia is an inheritable disease, its
prevention is possible by making an antenatal diagnosis. This
is done by chorionic villous biopsy or cells obtained by
amniocentesis and foetal DNA studied by PCR amplification
technique for presence of genetic mutations of thalassaemias.
APLASTIC ANAEMIA AND OTHER
PRIMARY BONE MARROW DISORDERS
‘Bone marrow failure’ is the term used for primary disorders
of the bone marrow which result in impaired formation of
the erythropoietic precursors and consequent anaemia. It
includes the following disorders:
1.
Aplastic anaemia, most importantly.

CHAPTER 12
Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series
2. Other primary bone marrow disroders such as: myelophthisic
anaemia, pure red cell aplasia, and myelodysplastic
syndromes.
These disorders are examples of hypoproliferative
anaemias in which anaemia is not the only finding but the
major problem is pancytopenia i.e. anaemia, leucopenia and
thrombocytopenia. While myelodysplastic syndromes are
discussed in Chapter 14, other conditions are considered
below.
APLASTIC ANAEMIA
Aplastic anaemia is defined as pancytopenia (i.e.
simultaneous presence of anaemia, leucopenia and
thrombocytopenia) resulting from aplasia of the bone
marrow. The underlying defect in all cases appears to be
sufficient reduction in the number of haematopoietic
pluripotent stem cells which results in decreased or total
absence of these cells for division and differentiation.
ETIOLOGY AND CLASSIFICATION.  Based on the
etiology, aplastic anaemia is classified into 2 main types:
primary and secondary. Various causes that may give rise
to both these types of aplastic anaemia are summarised in
Table 12.13 and briefly considered below:
A. Primary aplastic anaemia. Primary aplastic anaemia
includes 2 entities: a congenital form called Fanconi’s
anaemia and an immunologically-mediated acquired form.
1.
Fanconi’s anaemia. This has an autosomal recessive
inheritance and is often associated with other congenital
anomalies such as skeletal and renal abnormalities, and
sometimes mental retardation.
2.
Immune causes. In many cases, suppression of haemato-
poietic stem cells by immunologic mechanisms may cause
aplastic anaemia. The observations in support of autoimmune
mechanisms are the clinical response to immuno-
suppressive therapy and in vitro marrow culture experiments.
B. Secondary aplastic anaemia. Aplastic anaemia may occur
secondary to a variety of industrial, physical, chemical,
iatrogenic and infectious causes:
1.
Drugs. A number of drugs are cytotoxic to the marrow
and cause aplastic anaemia. The association of a drug with
aplastic anaemia may be either predictably dose-related or
an idiosyncratic reaction.
Dose-related aplasia of the bone marrow occurs with
antimetabolites (e.g. methotrexate), mitotic inhibitors (e.g.
daunorubicin), alkylating agents (e.g. busulfan), nitroso urea
and anthracyclines. In such cases, withdrawal of the drug
usually allows recovery of the marrow elements.
Idiosyncratic aplasia is depression of the bone marrow due
to qualitatively abnormal reaction of an individual to a drug
when first administered. The most serious and most common
example of idiosyncratic aplasia is associated with
chloramphenicol. Other such common drugs are sulfa drugs,
oxyphenbutazone, phenylbutazone, chlorpromazine, gold
salts etc.
2.
Toxic chemicals. These include examples of industrial,
domestic and accidental use of substances such as benzene
derivatives, insecticides, arsenicals etc.
3.
Infections. Aplastic anaemia may occur following viral
hepatitis, Epstein-Barr virus infection, AIDS and other viral
illnesses.
4.
Miscellaneous. Lastly, aplastic anaemia has been reported
in association with certain other illnesses such as SLE, and
with therapeutic X-rays.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The onset of aplastic anaemia may
occur at any age and is usually insidious. The clinical
manifestations include the following:
1.
Anaemia and its symptoms like mild progressive
weakness and fatigue.
2.
Haemorrhage from various sites due to thrombo-
cytopenia such as from the skin, nose, gums, vagina, bowel,
and occasionally in the CNS and retina.
3.
Infections of the mouth and throat are commonly present.
4.
The lymph nodes, liver and spleen are generally not
enlarged.
LABORATORY FINDINGS. The diagnosis of aplastic
anaemia is made by a thorough laboratory evaluation and
excluding other causes of pancytopenia (Table 12.14).  The
following haematological features are found:
1. Anaemia. Haemoglobin levels are moderately reduced.
The blood picture generally shows normocytic
normochromic anaemia but sometimes macrocytosis may
be present. The reticulocyte count is reduced or zero.
2. Leucopenia. The absolute granulocyte count is
particularly low (below 1500/μl) with relative lympho-
cytosis. The neutrophils are morphologically normal but
their alkaline phosphatase score is high.
TABLE 12.13: Causes of Aplastic Anaemia.
A. PRIMARY APLASTIC ANAEMIA
1. Fanconi’s anaemia (congenital)
2. Immunologically-mediated (acquired)
B. SECONDARY APLASTIC ANAEMIA
1. Drugs
i) Dose-related aplasia e.g. with antimetabolites (methotrexate), mitotic
inhibitors (daunorubicin), alkylating agents (busulfan), nitroso urea,
anthracyclines.
ii) Idiosyncratic aplasia e.g. with chloramphenicol, sulfa drugs,
oxyphenbutazone, phenylbutazone, chlorpromazine, gold salts.
2. Toxic chemicals e.g. benzene derivatives, insecticides, arsenicals.
3. Infections e.g. infectious hepatitis, EB virus infection, AIDS, other
viral illnesses.
4. Miscellaneous e.g. association with SLE and therapeutic X-rays

1. Myelodysplastic syndromes
2. Hypersplenism
3. Megaloblastic anaemia
III. Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (page 314)
IV. Bone marrow infiltrations e.g.
1. Haematologic malignancies (leukaemias, lymphomas, myeloma)
2. Non-haematologic metastatic malignancies
3. Storage diseases
4. Osteopetrosis
5. Myelofibrosis

326
SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
3.Thrombocytopenia.  Platelet count is always reduced.
4.Bone marrow examination. A bone marrow aspirate
may yield a ‘dry tap’. A trephine biopsy is generally
essential for making the diagnosis which reveals patchy
cellular areas in a hypocellular or aplastic marrow due to
replacement by fat. There is usually a severe depression
of myeloid cells, megakaryocytes and erythroid cells so
that the marrow chiefly consists of lymphocytes and
plasma cells (Fig. 12.35).  Haematopoieitc stem cells
bearing CD34 marker are markedly reduced or absent.
Treatment
The patients of mild aplasia may show spontaneous recovery,
while the management of severe aplastic anaemia is a most
challenging task. In general, younger patients show better
response to proper treatment. The broad outlines of the
treatment are as under:
A. General management: It consists of the following:
1.
Identification and elimination of the possible cause.
2.
Supportive care consisting of blood transfusions, platelet
concentrates, and treatment and prevention of infections.
B. Specific treatment: The specific treatment has been
attempted with varying success and includes the following:
1.
Marrow stimulating agents such as androgen may be
administered orally.
2.
Immunosuppressive therapy with agents such as anti-
thymocyte globulin and anti-lymphocyte serum has been
tried with 40-50% success rate. Very high doses of
glucocorticoids or cyclosporine may yield similar responses.
But splenectomy does not have any role in the management
of aplastic anaemia.
3.
Bone marrow transplantation is considered in severe cases
under the age of 40 years where the HLA and mixed culture-
matched donor is available. (Other indications for bone
marrow transplantation are: acute leukaemias—AML in first
remission and ALL in second remission, thalassaemia major
and combined immunodeficiency disease). Complications of
bone marrow transplantation such as severe infections, graft
rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) may occur
(Chapter 4).
Severe aplastic anaemia is a serious disorder terminating
in death within 6-12 months in 50-80% of cases. Death is
usually due to bleeding and/or infection.
MYELOPHTHISIC ANAEMIA
Development of severe anaemia may result from infiltration
of the marrow termed as myelophthisic anaemia. The causes
for marrow infiltrations include the following (Table12.14):
Haematologic malignancies (e.g. leukaemia, lymphoma,
myeloma).
Metastatic deposits from non-haematologic malignancies
(e.g. cancer breast, stomach, prostate, lung, thyroid).
Advanced tuberculosis.
Primary lipid storage diseases (Gaucher’s and Niemann-
Pick’s disease).
Osteopetrosis and myelofibrosis may rarely cause
myelophthisis.
The type of anaemia in myelophthisis is generally
normocytic normochromic with some fragmented red cells,
basophilic stippling and normoblasts in the peripheral blood.
Thrombocytopenia is usually present but the leucocyte count
is increased with slight shift-to-left of myeloid cells i.e. a
picture of leucoerythroblastic reaction consisting of immature
myeloid cells and normoblasts is seen in the peripheral blood.
Treatment consists of reversing the underlying pathologic
process.
PURE RED CELL APLASIA
Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare syndrome involving a
selective failure in the production of erythroid elements in
the bone marrow but with normal granulopoiesis and mega-
karyocytopoiesis. Patients have normocytic normochromic
anaemia with normal granulocyte and platelet count.
Reticulocytes are markedly decreased or are absent.
PRCA exists in the following forms:
Transient self-limited PRCA: It is due to temporary marrow
failure in aplastic crisis in haemolytic anamias and in acute
B19 parvovirus infection and in transient erythroblastopenia
in normal children.
Acquired PRCA:  It is seen in middle-aged adults in asso-
ciation with some other diseases, most commonly thymoma;
others are connective tissue diseases (SLE, rheumatoid
arthritis), lymphoid malignancies (lymphoma, T-cell
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) and solid tumours.
 Chronic B19 parvovirus infections: PRCA may occur from
chronic B19 parvovirus infection in children and is common
and treatable. B19 parvovirus produces cytopathic effects on
the marrow erythroid precursor cells and are charac-
teristically seen as giant pronomoblasts.
Congenital PRCA (Blackfan-Diamond syndrome) is a rare
chronic disorder detected at birth or in early childhood. It
occurs due to mutation in a ribosomal RNA processing gene
termed as RPS19. The disorder is corrected by glucocorticoids
and marrow transplantation.

THROMBOPOIESIS
As outlined in previous chapter and illustrated in Fig. 12.3,
the trilineage myeloid stem cells in the bone marrow
differentiate into erythroid progenitor, granulocyte-
monocyte progenitor, and megakaryocyte progenitor cells.
Platelets are formed in the bone marrow by a process of
fragmentation of the cytoplasm of megakaryocytes. Platelet
production is under the control of thrombopoietin, the nature
and origin of which are not yet established. The stages in
platelet production are: megakaryoblast, promegakaryocyte,
megakaryocyte, and discoid platelets (Fig. 13.1).
MEGAKARYOBLAST. The earliest precursor of platelets
in the bone marrow is megakaryoblast. It arises from
haematopoietic stem cell by a process of differentiation.
PROMEGAKARYOCYTE. A megakaryoblast undergoes
endo-reduplication of nuclear chromatin i.e. nuclear
chromatin replicates repeatedly in multiples of two without
division of the cell. Ultimately, a large cell containing up to
32 times the normal diploid content of nuclear DNA
(polyploidy) is formed when further nuclear replication
ceases and cytoplasm becomes granular.
MEGAKARYOCYTE. A mature megakaryocyte is a large
cell, 30-90 μm in diameter, and contains 4-16 nuclear lobes
having coarsely clumped chromatin. The cytoplasm is
abundant, light blue in colour and contains red-purple
granules. Platelets are formed from pseudopods of
megakaryocyte cytoplasm which get detached into the blood
stream. Each megakaryocyte may form up to 4000 platelets.
The formation of platelets from the stem cell takes about
10 days.
PLATELETS. Platelets are small (1-4 μm in diameter),
discoid, non-nucleate structures containing red-purple
granules. The normal platelet count ranges from 150,000-
400,000/μl and the lifespan of platelets is 7-10 days. About
70% of platelets are in circulation while remaining 30% lie
sequestered in the spleen. Newly-formed platelets spend
24-36 hours in the spleen before being released into
circulation but splenic stasis does not cause any injury to the
platelets normally. Factors such as stress, epinephrine and
exercise stimulate platelet production.
The main functions of platelets is in haemostasis which
includes two closely linked processes:
1. Primary haemostasis. This term is used for platelet plug
formation at the site of injury. It is an immediate phenomenon
appearing within seconds of injury and is responsible for
cessation of bleeding from microvasculature. Primary
haemostasis involves three steps: platelet adhesion, platelet
granule release and platelet aggregation which are regulated
by changes in membrane phospholipids, and calcium
(Fig. 13.2). At molecular level, these important events are
depicted diagrammatically in Fig. 13.3 and briefly outlined
below:
Figure 13.1
Thrombopoiesis.

328
SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
Platelet adhesion: Platelets adhere to collagen in the
subendothelium due to presence of receptor on platelet
surface, glycoprotein (Gp) Ia-IIa which is an integrin. The
adhesion to the vessel wall is further stabilised by von
Willebrand factor, an adhesion glycoprotein. This is achieved
by formation of a link between von Willebrand factor and
another platelet receptor, GpIb-IX complex.
Platelet release: After adhesion, platelets become
activated and release three types of granules from their
cytoplasm: dense granules, α-granules and lysosomal
vesicles. Important products released from these granules
are: ADP, ATP, calcium, serotonin, platelet factor 4, factor
V, factor VIII, thrombospondin, platelet-derived growth
factor (PDGF), von Willebrand factor (vWF), fibronectin,
fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor –1 (PAI-1) and
thromboxane A2.
Platelet aggregation: This process is mediated by fibrinogen
which forms bridge between adjacent platelets via
glycoprotein receptors on platelets, GpIIb-IIIa.
2.
Secondary haemostasis. This involves plasma coagu-
lation system resulting in fibrin plug formation and takes
several minutes for completion. This is discussed in detail in
Chapter 5.
BLEEDING DISORDERS
(HAEMORRHAGIC DIATHESIS)
Bleeding disorders or haemorrhagic diatheses are a group
of disorders characterised by defective haemostasis with
abnormal bleeding. The tendency to bleeding may be
spontaneous in the form of small haemorrhages into the skin
and mucous membranes (e.g. petechiae, purpura,
ecchymoses), or there may be excessive external or internal
bleeding following trivial trauma and surgical procedure (e.g.
haematoma, haemarthrosis etc).
The causes of haemorrhagic diatheses may or may not
be related to platelet abnormalities. These causes are broadly
divided into the following groups:
I.
Haemorrhagic diathesis due to vascular abnormalities.
II. Haemorrhagic diathesis related to platelet abnormalities.
III. Disorders of coagulation factors.
IV. Haemorrhagic diathesis due to fibrinolytic defects.
V. Combination of all these as occurs in disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC).
Before discussing the bleeding disorders, it is considered
desirable to briefly review the broad outlines of scheme of
investigations to be carried out in such a case.
INVESTIGATIONS OF HAEMOSTATIC FUNCTION
Normal haemostatic mechanism and thrombogenesis were
discussed in Chapter 5. In general, the haemostatic
mechanisms have 2 primary functions:
To promote local haemostasis at the site of injured blood
vessel.
To ensure that the circulating blood remains in fluid state
while in the vascular bed i.e. to prevent the occurrence of
generalised thrombosis.
Formation of haemostatic plug is a complex mechanism
and involves maintenance of a delicate balance among at least
5 components (Fig. 13.4): (i) blood vessel wall; (ii) platelets;
(iii) plasma coagulation factors; (iv) inhibitors; and (v) fibrino-
lytic system.
Anything that interferes with any of these components
results in defective haemostasis with abnormal bleeding. In
order to establish a definite diagnosis in any case suspected
to have abnormal haemostatic functions, the following
scheme is followed:
A. Comprehensive clinical evaluation, including the patient’s
history, family history and details of the site, frequency and
character of haemostatic defect.
B. Series of screening tests for assessing the abnormalities in
various components involved in maintaining haemostatic
balance.
C. Specific tests to pinpoint the cause.
A brief review of general principles of tests used to
investigate haemostatic abnormalities is presented below and
summarised in Table 13.1.
A. Investigation of Disordered Vascular Haemostasis
Disorders of vascular haemostasis may be due to increased
vascular permeability, reduced capillary strength and failure

release (activation) and aggregation.

Disorders of Platelets, Bleeding Disorders and Basic Transfusion Medicine
to contract after injury. Tests of defective vascular function
are as under:
1.
BLEEDING TIME. This simple test is based on the
principle of formation of haemostatic plug following a
standard incision on the volar surface of the forearm and the
time the incision takes to stop bleeding is measured. The test
is dependent upon capillary function as well as on platelet
number and ability of platelets to adhere to form aggregates.
Normal range is 3-8 minutes. A prolonged bleeding time may
be due to following causes:
i)
Thrombocytopenia.
ii) Disorders of platelet function.
iii) von Willebrand’s disease.
iv) Vascular abnormalities (e.g. in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome).
v) Severe deficiency of factor V and XI.
2.
HESS CAPILLARY RESISTANCE TEST (TOURNI-
QUET TEST). This test is done by tying sphygmomanometer
cuff to the upper arm and raising the pressure in it between
diastolic and systolic for 5 minutes. After deflation, the
number of petechiae appearing in the next 5 minutes in
3 cm2 area over the cubital fossa are counted. Presence of
more than 20 petechiae is considered a positive test. The test
is positive in increased capillary fragility as well as in
thrombocytopenia.
B. Investigation of Platelets and Platelet Function
Haemostatic disorders are commonly due to abnormalities
in platelet number, morphology or function.
1.
SCREENING TESTS. The screening tests carried out for
assessing platelet-related causes are as under:
i)
Peripheral blood platelet count.
ii) Skin bleeding time.
iii) Examination of fresh blood film to see the morphologic
abnormalities of platelets.
2.
SPECIAL TESTS. If these screening tests suggest a
disorder of platelet function, the following platelet function
tests may be carried out:
i)
Platelet adhesion tests such as retention in a glass bead
column, and other sophisticated techniques.
ii) Aggregation tests which are turbidometric techniques
using ADP, collagen or ristocetin.
iii) Granular content of the platelets and their release can be
assessed by electron microscopy or by measuring the
substances released.
iv) Platelet coagulant activity is measured indirectly by
prothrombin consumption index.
C. Investigation of Blood Coagulation
The normal blood coagulation system consists of cascade of
activation of 13 coagulation factors. These form intrinsic,
extrinsic and common pathways which culminate in
formation of thrombin that acts on fibrinogen to produce
fibrin. Fibrin clot so formed is strengthened by factor XIII

which itself gets activated by thrombin. The process of
fibrinolysis or clot dissolution and the role of platelets in
activation of cascade and formation of haemostatic plug are
illustrated in Fig. 13.5.
1.
SCREENING TESTS. Tests for blood coagulation sys-
tem include a battery of screening tests. These are as under:
I.
Whole blood coagulation time. The estimation of whole
blood coagulation time done by various capillary and tube
methods is of limited value since it is an insensitive and
nonspecific test. Normal range is 4-9 minutes at 37°C.
II. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) or partial
thromboplastin time with kaolin (PTTK). This test is used
to measure the intrinsic system factors (VIII, IX, XI and XII)
as well as factors common to both intrinsic and extrinsic
systems (factors X, V, prothrombin and fibrinogen). The test
consists of addition of 3 substances to the plasma—calcium,
phospholipid and a surface activator such as kaolin. The
normal range is 30-40 seconds. The common causes of a
prolonged PTTK (or APTT) are as follows:
i)
Parenteral administration of heparin.
ii) Disseminated intravascular coagulation.
iii) Liver disease.
iv) Circulating anticoagulants.
III. One-stage prothrombin time (PT). PT measures the
extrinsic system factor VII as well as factors in the common
pathway. In this test, tissue thromboplastin (e.g. brain extract)
and calcium are added to the test. The normal PT in this test
is 10-14 seconds. The common causes of prolonged one-stage
PT are as under:
i)
Administration of oral anticoagulant drugs.
ii) Liver disease, especially obstructive liver disease.
iii) Vitamin K deficiency.
iv) Disseminated intravascular coagulation.
IV.  Measurement of fibrinogen. The screening tests for
fibrinogen deficiency are semiquantitative fibrinogen titre
and thrombin time (TT). The normal value of thrombin time
is under 20 seconds, while a fibrinogen titre in plasma
dilution up to 32 is considered normal.  Following are the
common causes for higher values in both these tests:
i)
Hypofibrinogenaemia (e.g. in DIC).
ii) Raised concentration of FDP.
iii) Presence of heparin.
2.
SPECIAL TESTS. In the presence of an abnormality in
screening tests, detailed investigations for the possible cause
are carried out. These include the following:
i)
Coagulation factor assays. These bioassays are based on
results of PTTK or PT tests and employ the use of substrate

plasma that contains all other coagulation factors except the
one to be measured. The unknown level of the factor activity
is compared with a standard control plasma with a known
level of activity. Results are expressed as percentage of
normal activity.
ii) Quantitative assays. The coagulation factors can be
quantitatively assayed by immunological and other chemical
methods.
D. Investigation of Fibrinolytic System
Increased levels of circulating plasminogen activator are
present in patients with hyperfibrinolysis. Following
screening tests are done to assess these abnormalities in
fibrinolytic system:
1.
Estimation of fibrinogen.
2.
Fibrin degradation products (FDP) in the serum.
3.
Ethanol gelation test.
4.
Euglobin or whole blood lysis time.
More specific tests include: functional assays, immuno-
logical assays by ELISA, and chromogenic assays of
plasminogen activators, plasminogen, plasminogen activator
inhibitor, and FDP.
With this background knowledge on work up of a case
of haemostatic abnormality, we now turn to discuss the
common specific haemorrhagic disorders under the
following headings:
I.
Haemostatic diatheses due to vascular disorders.
II. Haemostatic diatheses due to platelet disorders.
III. Coagulation disorders.
IV. Haemostatic diatheses due to fibrinolytic defects.
V. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
HAEMORRHAGIC DIATHESES DUE TO
VASCULAR DISORDERS
Vascular bleeding disorders, also called non-thrombo-
cytopenic purpuras or vascular purpuras, are normally mild
and characterised by petechiae, purpuras or ecchymoses
confined to the skin and mucous membranes. The
pathogenesis of bleeding is poorly understood since majority
of the standard screening tests of haemostasis including the
bleeding time, coagulation time, platelet count and platelet
function, are usually normal. Vascular purpuras arise from
damage to the capillary endothelium, abnormalities in the
subendothelial matrix or extravascular connective tissue that
supports the blood vessels, or from formation of abnormal
blood vessels.
Vascular bleeding disorders may be inherited or acquired.
A. Inherited Vascular Bleeding Disorders
A few examples of hereditary vascular disorders are given
below:
1.
Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-
Rendu disease). This is an uncommon inherited autosomal
dominant disorder. The condition begins in childhood and
is characterised by abnormally telangiectatic (dilated)
capillaries. These telangiectasias develop particularly in the
skin, mucous membranes and internal organs and are the
source of frequent episodes of bleeding from the nose and
gastrointestinal tract.
2.
Inherited disorders of connective tissue matrix. These
include Marfan’s syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and
pseudoxanthoma elasticum, all of which have inherited
defect in the connective tissue matrix and, thus, have fragile
skin vessels and easy bruising.
B. Acquired Vascular Bleeding Disorders
Several acquired conditions are associated with vascular
purpuras. These are as under:
1.
Henoch-Schönlein purpura. Henoch-Schönlein or
anaphylactoid purpura is a self-limited type of hyper-
sensitivity vasculitis occurring in children and young adults.
Circulating immune complexes are deposited in the vessel
wall consisting of IgA, C3 and fibrin, and in some cases,
properdin suggesting activation of alternate complement
pathway as the trigger event. The hypersensitivity vasculitis
produces purpuric rash on the extensor surfaces of arms, legs
and on the buttocks, as well as haematuria, colicky
abdominal pain due to bleeding into the GIT, polyarthralgia
and acute nephritis. In spite of these haemorrhagic features,
all coagulation tests are normal.
2.
Haemolytic-uraemic syndrome. Haemolytic-uraemic
syndrome is a disease of infancy and early childhood in which
there is bleeding tendency and varying degree of acute renal
failure. The disorder remains confined to the kidney where
hyaline thrombi are seen in the glomerular capillaries.
3.
Simple easy bruising (Devil’s pinches). Easy bruising
of unknown cause is a common phenomenon in women of
child-bearing age group.
4.
Infection. Many infections cause vascular haemorrhages
either by causing toxic damage to the endothelium or by DIC.
These are especially prone to occur in septicaemia and severe
measles.
5.
Drug reactions. Certain drugs form antibodies and
produce hypersensitivity (or leucocytoclastic) vasculitis
responsible for abnormal bleeding.
6.
Steroid purpura. Long-term steroid therapy or Cushing’s
syndrome may be associated with vascular purpura due to
defective vascular support.
7.
Senile purpura. Atrophy of the supportive tissue of
cutaneous blood vessels in old age may cause senile atrophy,
especially in the dorsum of forearm and hand.
8.
Scurvy. Deficiency of vitamin C causes defective colla-
gen synthesis which causes skin bleeding as well as bleeding
into muscles, and occasionally into the gastrointestinal and
genitourinary tracts.
HAEMORRHAGIC DIATHESES DUE TO
PLATELET DISORDERS
Disorders of platelets produce bleeding disorders by one of
the following 3 mechanisms:
A. Due to reduction in the number of platelets i.e. various forms
of thrombocytopenias.

332
SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
B. Due to rise in platelet count i.e. thrombocytosis.
C. Due to defective platelet functions.
A. THROMBOCYTOPENIAS
Thrombocytopenia is defined as a reduction in the peripheral
blood platelet count below the lower limit of normal i.e. below
150,000/μl. Thrombocytopenia is associated with abnormal
bleeding that includes spontaneous skin purpura and
mucosal haemorrhages as well as prolonged bleeding after
trauma. However, spontaneous haemorrhagic tendency
becomes clinically evident only after severe depletion of the
platelet count to level below 20,000/μl.
Thrombocytopenia may result from 4 main groups of
causes:
1.
Impaired platelet production.
2.
Accelerated platelet destruction.
3.
Splenic sequestration.
4.
Dilutional loss.
A list of causes of thrombocytopenia is given in
Table 13.2. Three of the common and important causes—
drug-induced thrombocytopenia, idiopathic thrombocyto-
penic purpura (ITP), and thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura (TTP), are discussed below.
Drug-induced Thrombocytopenia
Many commonly used drugs cause thrombocytopenia by
depressing megakaryocyte production. In most cases, an
immune mechanism by formation of drug-antibody comp-
lexes is implicated in which the platelet is damaged as an
‘innocent bystander’. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia is
associated with many commonly used drugs and includes:
chemotherapeutic agents (alkylating agents, anthracyclines,
antimetabolites), certain antibiotics (sulfonamides, PAS,
rifampicin, penicillins), drugs used in cardiovascular diseases
(digitoxin, thiazide diuretics), diclofenac, acyclovir, heparin
and excessive consumption of ethanol.
Clinically, the patient presents with acute purpura. The
platelet count is markedly lowered, often below 10,000/μl
and the bone marrow shows normal or increased number of
megakaryocytes.
The immediate treatment is to stop or replace the
suspected drug with instruction to the patient to avoid taking
the offending drug in future. Occasional patients may require
temporary support with glucocorticoids, plasmapheresis or
platelet transfusions.
Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia
Thrombocytopenia due to administration of heparin is
distinct from that caused by other drugs in following ways:
i) Thrombocytopenia is generally not so severe to fall to level
below 20,000/μl.
ii) Unlike drug-induced thrombocytopenia, heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia is not associated with bleeding but instead
these patients are more prone to develop thrombosis.
The underlying mechanism of heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia is formation of antibody against platelet
factor 4 (PF-4)-heparin complex. This specific antibody
activates the endothelial cells and initiates thrombus
formation. It occurs in a small proportion of cases after the
patient has received heparin for 5-10 days.
Diagnosis is made by a combination of laboratory and
clinical features with 4 Ts: thrombocytopenia, thrombosis,
time of fall of platelet count, absence of other causes of
thrombocytopenia.
Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or immune
thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), is characterised by
immunologic destruction of platelets and normal or increased
megakaryocytes in the bone marrow.
PATHOGENESIS. On the basis of duration of illness, ITP is
classified into acute and chronic forms, both of which have
different pathogenesis.
Acute ITP. This is a self-limited disorder, seen most
frequently in children following recovery from a viral illness
(e.g. hepatitis C, infectious mononucleosis, CMV infection,
HIV infection) or an upper respiratory illness. The onset of
acute ITP is sudden and severe thrombocytopenia but
recovery occurs within a few weeks to 6 months. The
mechanism of acute ITP is by formation of immune complexes
containing viral antigens, and by formation of antibodies
against viral antigens which crossreact with platelets and
lead to their immunologic destruction.
Chronic ITP. Chronic ITP occurs more commonly in adults,
particularly in women of child-bearing age (20-40 years). The
disorder develops insidiously and persists for several years.
Though chronic ITP is idiopathic, similar immunologic
thrombocytopenia may be seen in association with SLE, AIDS
and autoimmune thyroiditis. The pathogenesis of chronic ITP
TABLE 13.2: Causes of Thrombocytopenia.
I.
IMPAIRED PLATELET PRODUCTION
1. Generalised bone marrow failure e.g.
Aplastic anaemia, leukaemia, myelofibrosis, megaloblastic
anaemia, marrow infiltrations (carcinomas, lymphomas, multiple
myeloma, storage diseases).
2. Selective suppression of platelet production e.g.
Drugs (quinine, quinidine, sulfonamides, PAS, rifampicin,
anticancer drugs, thiazide diuretics), (heparin, diclofenac,
acyclovir),  alcohol intake.
II.
ACCELERATED PLATELET DESTRUCTION
1. Immunologic thrombocytopenias e.g.
ITP (acute and chronic), neonatal and post-transfusion
(isoimmune), drug-induced, secondary immune ‘thrombo-
cytopenia (post-infection, SLE, AIDS, CLL, lymphoma).
2. Increased consumption e.g.
DIC, TTP, giant haemangiomas, microangiopathic haemolytic
anaemia.
III. SPLENIC SEQUESTRATION
Splenomegaly
IV. DILUTIONAL LOSS
Massive transfusion of old stored blood to bleeding patients.

333
CHAPTER 13
Disorders of Platelets, Bleeding Disorders and Basic Transfusion Medicine
is explained by formation of anti-platelet autoantibodies,
usually by platelet-associated IgG humoral antibodies
synthesised mainly in the spleen. These antibodies are
directed against target antigens on the platelet glycoproteins,
Gp IIb-IIIa and Gp Ib-IX complex. Some of the antibodies
directed against platelet surface also interfere in their
function. The mechanism of platelet destruction is similar to
that seen in autoimmune haemolytic anaemias. Sensitised
platelets are destroyed mainly in the spleen and rendered
susceptible to phagocytosis by cells of the reticuloendothelial
system.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The clinical manifestation of ITP
may develop abruptly in cases of acute ITP, or the onset may
be insidious as occurs in majority of cases of chronic ITP.
The usual manifestations are petechial haemorrhages, easy
bruising, and mucosal bleeding such as menorrhagia in
women, nasal bleeding, bleeding from gums, melaena and
haematuria. Intracranial haemorrhage is, however, rare.
Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly may occur in cases with
chronic ITP but lymphadenopathy is quite uncommon in
either type of ITP.
LABORATORY FINDINGS. The diagnosis of ITP can be
suspected on clinical features after excluding the known
causes of thrombocytopenia and is supported by the
following haematologic findings:
1. Platelet count is markedly reduced, usually in the range
of 10,000-50,000/μl.
2. Blood film shows only occasional platelets which are
often large in size (Fig. 13.6,A).
3. Bone marrow shows increased number of mega-
karyocytes which have large non-lobulated single nuclei
and may have reduced cytoplasmic granularity and
presence of vacuoles (Fig. 13.6, B).
4. With sensitive techniques, anti-platelet IgG antibody can
be demonstrated on platelet surface or in the serum of
patients.
5. Platelet survival studies reveal markedly reduced platelet
lifespan, sometimes less than one hour, as compared with
normal lifespan of 7-10 days.
TREATMENT. Spontaneous recovery occurs in 90% cases
of acute ITP, while only less than 10% cases of chronic ITP
Figure 13.6
Laboratory findings of ITP contrasted with those found
in a normal individual. A, Peripheral blood in ITP shows presence of
reduced number of platelets which are often large. B, Bone marrow in
ITP shows characteristically increased number of megakaryocytes with
single non-lobulated nuclei and reduced cytoplasmic granularity (inbox
on right photomicrograph).

334
SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
recover spontaneously. Treatment is directed at reducing the
level and source of autoantibodies and reducing the rate of
destruction of sensitised platelets. This is possible by
corticosteroid therapy, immunosuppressive drugs (e.g.
vincristine, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine) and
splenectomy. Beneficial effects of splenectomy in chronic ITP
are due to both removal of the major site of platelet
destruction and the major source of autoantibody synthesis.
Platelet transfusions are helpful as a palliative measure only
in patients with severe haemorrhage.
Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) and
Haemolytic-Uraemic Syndrome (HUS)
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and haemo-
lytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS) are a group of thrombotic
microangiopathies which are essentially characterised by
triad of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia
and formation of hyaline fibrin microthrombi within the micro-
vasculature throughout the body. These are often fulminant
and lethal disorders occurring in young adults. The intra-
vascular microthrombi are composed predominantly of
platelets and fibrin. The widespread presence of these platelet
microthrombi is responsible for thrombocytopenia due to
increased consumption of platelets, microangiopathic haemo-
lytic anaemia and protean clinical manifestations involving
different organs and tissues throughout the body.
PATHOGENESIS. Unlike DIC, a clinicopathologically
related condition, activation of the clotting system is not the
primary event in formation of microthrombi. TTP is initiated
by endothelial injury followed by release of von Willebrand
factor and other procoagulant material from endothelial cells,
leading to the formation of microthrombi. Trigger for the
endothelial injury comes from immunologic damage by
diverse conditions such as in pregnancy, metastatic cancer,
high-doze chemotherapy, HIV infection, and mitomycin C.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The clinical manifestations of TTP
are due to microthrombi in the arterioles, capillaries and
venules throughout the body. Besides features of thrombo-
cytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia,
characteristic findings include fever, transient neurologic
deficits and renal failure. The spleen may be palpable.
LABORATORY FINDINGS. The diagnosis can be made
from the following findings:
1. Thrombocytopenia.
2. Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia with negative
Coombs’ test.
3. Leucocytosis, sometimes with leukaemoid reaction.
4. Bone marrow examination reveals normal or slightly
increased megakaryocytes accompanied with some
myeloid hyperplasia.
5. Diagnosis is, however, established by examination of
biopsy (e.g. from gingiva) which demonstrates typical
microthrombi in arterioles, capillaries and venules,
unassociated with any inflammatory changes in the vessel
wall.
B.  THROMBOCYTOSIS
Thrombocytosis is defined as platelet count in excess of
4,00,000/μl. While essential or primary thrombocytosis or
thrombocythaemia is discussed under myeloproliferative
disorders in the next chapter, secondary or reactive
thrombocytosis can occur following massive haemorrhage,
iron deficiency, severe sepsis, marked inflammation,
disseminated cancers, haemolysis, or following splenectomy.
Thrombocytosis causes bleeding or thrombosis but how it
produces is not clearly known.
As such, transitory and secondary thrombocytisis does
not require any separate treatment other than treating the
cause.
C. DISORDERS OF PLATELET FUNCTIONS
Defective platelet function is suspected in patients who show
skin and mucosal haemorrhages and have prolonged
bleeding time but a normal platelet count. These disorders
may be hereditary or acquired.
Hereditary Disorders
Depending upon the predominant functional abnormality,
inherited disorders of platelet functions are classified into
the following 3 groups:
1.
DEFECTIVE PLATELET ADHESION. These are as
under:
i)
Bernard-Soulier syndrome is an autosomal recessive
disorder with inherited deficiency of a platelet membrane
glycoprotein which is essential for adhesion of platelets to
vessel wall.
ii) In von Willebrand’s disease, there is defective platelet
adhesion as well as deficiency of factor VIII (page 336).
2.
DEFECTIVE PLATELET AGGREGATION. In thromba-
sthenia (Glanzmann’s disease), there is failure of primary
platelet aggregation with ADP or collagen due to inherited
deficiency of two of platelet membrane glycoproteins.
3.
DISORDERS OF PLATELET RELEASE REACTION.
These disorders are characterised by normal initial
aggregation of platelets with ADP or collagen but the
subsequent release of ADP, prostaglandins and 5-HT is
defective due to complex intrinsic deficiencies.
Acquired Disorders
Acquired defects of platelet functions include the following
clinically significant examples:
1.
ASPIRIN THERAPY. Prolonged use of aspirin leads to
easy bruising and abnormal bleeding time. This is because
aspirin inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase, and thereby
suppresses the synthesis of prostaglandins which are
involved in platelet aggregation as well as release reaction.
The anti-platelet effect of aspirin is clinically applied in
preventing major thromboembolic disease in recurrent
myocardial infarction.
2.
OTHERS. Several other acquired disorders are associated
with various abnormalities in platelet functions at different

335
CHAPTER 13
Disorders of Platelets, Bleeding Disorders and Basic Transfusion Medicine
levels. These include: uraemia, liver disease, multiple
myeloma, Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia and various
myeloproliferative disorders.
COAGULATION DISORDERS
The physiology of normal coagulation is described in Chapter
5 together with relatively more common coagulation
disorders of arterial and venous thrombosis and embolism.
A deficiency of each of the thirteen known plasma
coagulation factors has been reported, which may be
inherited or acquired. In general, coagulation disorders are
less common as compared with other bleeding disorders. The
type of bleeding in coagulation disorders is different from
that seen in vascular and platelet abnormalities. Instead of
spontaneous appearance of petechiae and purpuras, the
plasma coagulation defects manifest more often in the form
of large ecchymoses, haematomas and bleeding into muscles,
joints, body cavities, GIT and urinary tract. For establishing
the diagnosis, screening tests for coagulation (whole blood
coagulation time, bleeding time, activated partial
thromboplastin time and prothrombin time) are carried out,
followed by coagulation factor assays as discussed already on
page 330.
Disorders of plasma coagulation factors may have here-
ditary or acquired origin.
HEREDITARY COAGULATION DISORDERS. Most of the
inherited plasma coagulation disorders are due to qualitative
or quantitative defect in a single coagulation factor. Out of
defects in various coagulation factors, two of the most
common inherited coagulation disorders are the sex-(X)-
linked disorders—classic haemophilia or haemophilia A (due to
inherited deficiency of factor VIII), and Christmas disease or
haemophilia B (due to inherited deficiency of factor IX).
Another common and related coagulation disorder, von
Willebrand’s disease (due to inherited defect of von
Willebrand’s factor), is also discussed here.
ACQUIRED COAGULATION DISORDERS. The acquired
coagulation disorders, on the other hand, are usually
characterised by deficiencies of multiple coagulation factors.
The most common acquired clotting abnormalities are:
vitamin K deficiency, coagulation disorder in liver diseases,
fibrinolytic defects and disseminated intravascular
coagulation (DIC).
The more common of the hereditary and acquired
coagulation disorders are discussed below.
Classic Haemophilia (Haemophilia A)
Classic haemophilia or haemophilia A is the second most
common hereditary coagulation disorder next to von
Willebrand’s disease occurring due to deficiency or reduced
activity of factor VIII (anti-haemophilic factor). The disorder
is inherited as a sex-(X-) linked recessive trait and, therefore,
manifests clinically in males, while females are usually the
carriers. However, occasional women carriers of haemophilia
may produce factor VIII levels far below 50% and become
symptomatic carriers, or rarely there may be true female
haemophilics arising from consanguinity within the family
(i.e. homozygous females). The chances of a proven carrier
mother passing on the abnormality to her children is 50:50
for each son and 50:50 for each daughter. A haemophilic
father will have normal sons as they inherit his Y chromo-
some only that does not carry the genetic abnormality.
The disease has been known since ancient times but
Schönlein in 1839 gave this bleeder’s disease its present name
haemophilia. In 1952, it was found that haemophilia was not
always due to deficiency of factor VIII as was previously
considered but instead blood of some patients was deficient
in factor IX (Christmas factor or plasma thromboplastin
component). Currently, haemophilia A (classic haemophilia) is
the term used for the disorder due to factor VIII deficiency,
and haemophilia B (Christmas disease) for the disorder when
factor IX is deficient.
The frequency of haemophilia varies in different races,
the highest incidence being in populations of Britain,
Northern Europe and Australia. Western literature reports
give an overall incidence of haemophilia in 1 in 10,000 male
births. Another interesting facet of the haemophilia which
has attracted investigators and researchers is the occurrence
of this disorder in the blood of royal families in Great
Britain and some European countries.
PATHOGENESIS. Haemophilia A is caused by quantitative
reduction of factor VIII in 90% of cases, while 10% cases have
normal or increased level of factor VIII with reduced activity.
Factor VIII is synthesised in hepatic parenchymal cells and
regulates the activation of factor X in intrinsic coagulation
pathway. Factor VIII circulates in blood complexed to another
larger protein, von Willebrand’s factor (vWF), which
comprises 99% of the factor VIII-vWF complex. The genetic
coding, synthesis and functions of vWF are different from
those of factor VIII and are considered separately below
under von Willebrand’s disease. Normal haemostasis
requires 25% factor VIII activity. Though occasional patients
with 25% factor VIII level may develop bleeding, most
symptomatic haemophilic patients have factor VIII levels
below 5%.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Patients of haemophilia suffer from
bleeding for hours or days after the injury. The clinical
severity of the disease correlates well with plasma level of
factor VIII activity. Haemophilic bleeding can involve any
organ but occurs most commonly as recurrent painful
haemarthroses and muscle haematomas, and sometimes as
haematuria. Spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage and
oropharyngeal bleeding are rare, but when they occur they
are the most feared complications.
LABORATORY FINDINGS. The following tests are
abnormal:
1. Whole blood coagulation time is prolonged in severe
cases only.
2. Prothrombin time is usually normal.
3. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT or PTTK)
is typically prolonged.
4. Specific assay for factor VIII shows lowered activity.
The diagnosis of female carriers is made by the findings of
about half the activity of factor VIII, while the manifest
disease is associated with factor VIII activity below 25%.

336
SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
TREATMENT. Symptomatic patients with bleeding
episodes are treated with factor VIII replacement therapy,
consisting of factor VIII concentrates or plasma cryo-
precipitates. With the availability of this treatment, the life
expectancy of even severe haemophilic patients was approa-
ching normal but the occurrence of AIDS in multitransfused
haemophilic patients has adversely affected the life
expectancy.
Christmas Disease (Haemophilia B)
Inherited deficiency of factor IX (Christmas factor or plasma
thromboplastin component) produces Christmas disease or
haemophilia B. Haemophilia B is rarer than haemophilia A;
its estimated incidence is 1 in 100,000 male births. The
inheritance pattern and clinical features of factor IX deficiency
are indistinguishable from those of classic haemophilia but
accurate laboratory diagnosis is critical since haemophilia B
requires treatment with different plasma fraction. The usual
screening tests for coagulation are similar to those in classic
haemophilia but bioassay of factor IX reveals lowered
activity.
TREATMENT. Therapy in symptomatic haemophilia B
consists of infusion of either fresh frozen plasma or a plasma
enriched with factor IX. Besides the expected possibilities of
complications of hepatitis, chronic liver disease and AIDS,
the replacement therapy in factor IX deficiency may activate
the coagulation system and cause thrombosis and embolism.
von Willebrand’s Disease
DEFINITION AND PATHOGENESIS. von Willebrand’s
disease (vWD) is the most common hereditary coagulation
disorder occurring due to qualitative or quantitative defect
in von Willebrand’s factor (vWF). Its incidence is estimated
to be 1 in 1,000 individuals of either sex. The vWF comprises
the larger fraction of factor VIII-vWF complex which
circulates in the blood. Though the two components of factor
VIII-vWF complex circulate together as a unit and perform
the important function in clotting and facilitate platelet
adhesion to subendothelial collagen, vWF differs from factor
VIII in the following respects:
1.
The gene for vWF is located at chromosome 12, while that
of factor VIII is in X-chromosome. Thus, vWD is inherited as
an autosomal dominant trait which may occur in either sex,
while factor VIII deficiency (haemophilia A) is a sex (X-)-
linked recessive disorder.
2.
The vWF is synthesised in the endothelial cells, mega-
karyocytes and platelets but not in the liver cells, while the
principal site of synthesis of factor VIII is the liver.
3.
The main function of vWF is to facilitate the adhesion of
platelets to subendothelial collagen, while factor VIII is
involved in activation of factor X in the intrinsic coagulation
pathway.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Clinically, the patients of vWD are
characterised by spontaneous bleeding from mucous
membranes and excessive bleeding from wounds. There are
3 major types of vWD:
Type I disease is the most common and is characterised by
mild to moderate decrease in plasma vWF (50% activity).
The synthesis of vWF is normal but the release of its
multimers is inhibited.
Type II disease is much less common and is characterised
by normal or near normal levels of vWF which is functionally
defective.
Type III disease is extremely rare and is the most severe
form of the disease. These patients have no detectable vWF
activity and may have sufficiently low factor VIII levels.
Bleeding episodes in vWD are treated with cryo-
precipitates or factor VIII concentrates.
LABORATORY FINDINGS. These are as under:
1. Prolonged bleeding time.
2. Normal platelet count.
3. Reduced plasma vWF concentration.
4. Defective platelet aggregation with ristocetin, an
antibiotic.
5. Reduced factor VIII activity.
Vitamin K Deficiency
Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin which plays important
role in haemostasis since it serves as a cofactor in the
formation of 6 prothrombin complex proteins (vitamin K-
dependent coagulation factors) synthesised in the liver: factor
II, VII, IX, X, protein C and protein S. Vitamin K is obtained
from green vegetables, absorbed in the small intestine and
stored in the liver (Chapter 9). Some quantity of vitamin K is
endogenously synthesised by the bacteria in the colon.
Vitamin K deficiency may present in the newborn or in
subsequent childhood or adult life:
Neonatal vitamin K deficiency. Deficiency of vitamin K
in the newborn causes haemorrhagic disease of the newborn.
Liver cell immaturity, lack of gut bacterial synthesis of the
vitamin and low quantities in breast milk, all contribute to
vitamin K deficiency in the newborn and may cause
haemorrhage on 2nd to 4th day of life. Routine administration
of vitamin K to all newly born infants has led to
disappearance of neonatal vitamin K deficiency.
Vitamin K deficiency in children and adult. There are 3
major causes of vitamin K deficiency in childhood or adult
life:
1.
Inadequate dietary intake.
2.
Intestinal malabsorption.
3.
Loss of storage site due to hepatocellular disease.
With the onset of vitamin K deficiency, the plasma levels
of all the 6 vitamin K-dependent factors (prothrombin
complex proteins) fall. This, in turn, results in prolonged PT
and PTTK. Parenteral administration of vitamin K rapidly
restores vitamin K levels in the liver.
Coagulation Disorders in Liver Disease
Since liver is the major site for synthesis and metabolism of
coagulation factors, liver disease often leads to multiple
haemostatic abnormalities. The liver also produces inhibitors

337
CHAPTER 13
Disorders of Platelets, Bleeding Disorders and Basic Transfusion Medicine
of coagulation such as antithrombin III and protein C and S
and plays a role in the clearance of activated factors and
fibrinolytic enzymes. Thus, patients with liver disease may
develop hypercoagulability and are predisposed to develop
DIC and systemic fibrinolysis.
The major causes of bleeding in liver diseases are as
under:
A. Morphologic lesions:
1.
Portal hypertension e.g. varices, splenomegaly with
secondary thrombocytopenia.
2.
Peptic ulceration.
3.
Gastritis.
B. Hepatic dysfunctions:
1.
Impaired hepatic synthesis of coagulation factors.
2.
Impaired hepatic synthesis of coagulation inhibitors:
protein C, protein S and antithrombin III.
3.
Impaired absorption and metabolism of vitamin K.
4.
Failure to clear activated coagulation factors causing DIC
and systemic fibrinolysis.
C.  Complications of therapy:
1.
Following massive transfusion leading to dilution of
platelets and coagulation factors.
2.
Infusion of activated coagulation proteins.
3.
Following heparin therapy.
Many a times, the haemostatic abnormality in liver
disease is complex but most patients have prolonged PT and
PTTK, mild thrombocytopenia, normal fibrinogen level and
decreased hepatic stores of vitamin K.
HAEMORRHAGIC DIATHESIS DUE TO
FIBRINOLYTIC DEFECTS
Normally, fibrinolysis consisting of plasminogen-plasmin
and fibrin degradation products (FDPs) is an essential
protective physiologic mechanism to limit the blood
coagulation in the body. However, unchecked and excessive
fibrinolysis may sometimes be the cause of bleeding. The
causes of primary pathologic fibrinolysis leading to
haemorrhagic defects are as under:
1.
Deficiency of α2-plasmin inhibitor following trauma or
surgery.
2.
Impaired clearance of tissue plasminogen activator such
as in cirrhosis of liver.
At times, it may be difficult to distinguish primary
pathologic fibrinolysis from secondary fibrinolysis
accompanying DIC.
DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION (DIC)
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), also termed
defibrination syndrome or consumption coagulopathy, is a
complex thrombo-haemorrhagic disorder (intravascular
coagulation and haemorrhage) occurring as a secondary
complication in some systemic diseases.
ETIOLOGY. Although there are numerous conditions
associated with DIC, most frequent causes are listed below:
1.
Massive tissue injury: in obstetrical syndromes (e.g.
abruptio placentae, amniotic fluid embolism, retained dead
foetus), massive trauma, metastatic malignancies, surgery.
2.
Infections: especially endotoxaemia, gram-negative and
meningococcal septicaemia, certain viral infections, malaria,
aspergillosis.
3.
Widespread endothelial damage: in aortic aneurysm,
haemolytic-uraemic syndrome, severe burns, acute
glomerulonephritis.
4.
Miscellaneous: snake bite, shock, acute intravascular
haemolysis, heat stroke.
PATHOGENESIS. Although in each case, a distinct trig-
gering mechanism has been identified, the sequence of
events, in general, can be summarised as under (Fig. 13.7):
1.
Activation of coagulation. The etiologic factors listed
above initiate widespread activation of coagulation pathway
by release of tissue factor.
2.
Thrombotic phase. Endothelial damage from the various
thrombogenic stimuli causes generalised platelet aggregation
and adhesion with resultant deposition of small thrombi and
emboli throughout the microvasculature.
3.
Consumption phase. The early thrombotic phase is
followed by a phase of consumption of coagulation factors
and platelets.
4.
Secondary fibrinolysis. As a protective mechanism,
fibrinolytic system is secondarily activated at the site of
intravascular coagulation. Secondary fibrinolysis causes
breakdown of fibrin resulting in formation of FDPs in the
circulation.
Pathophysiology of DIC is summed up schematically in
Fig. 13.8.
Figure 13.7
The pathogenesis of disseminated intravascular coagulation.

338
SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
CLINICAL FEATURES. There are 2 main features of DIC—
bleeding as the most common manifestation, and organ
damage due to ischaemia caused by the effect of widespread
intravascular thrombosis such as in the kidney and brain.
Less common manifestations include: microangiopathic
haemolytic anaemia and thrombosis in larger arteries and
veins.
LABORATORY FINDINGS. The laboratory investigations
include the following:
1. The platelet count is low.
2. Blood film shows the features of microangiopathic
haemolytic anaemia. There is presence of schistocytes and
fragmented red cells due to damage caused by trapping
and passage through the fibrin thrombi.
3. Prothrombin time, thrombin time and activated partial
thromboplastin time, are all prolonged.
4. Plasma fibrinogen levels are reduced due to consump-
tion in microvascular coagulation.
5. Fibrin degradation products (FDPs) are raised due to
secondary fibrinolysis.
A summary of important laboratory findings in
common causes of haemostatic abnormalities is summed
up in Table 13.3.

Disorders of Platelets, Bleeding Disorders and Basic Transfusion Medicine
BLOOD GROUPS AND BLOOD TRANSFUSION
BLOOD GROUP ANTIGENS AND ANTIBODIES
Karl Landsteiner described the existence of major human
blood groups in 1900 and was awarded Nobel Prize in 1930.
The term blood group is applied to any well-defined system
of red blood cell antigens which are inherited characteristics.
Over 20 blood group systems having approximately 400
blood group antigens are currently recognised. The ABO and
Rhesus (Rh) blood group systems are of major clinical
significance. Other minor and clinically less important blood
group systems are: Lewis system, P system, I system, MNS
system, Kell and Duffy system, and Luthern system.
Individuals who lack the corresponding antigen and have
not been previously transfused have naturally-occurring
antibodies in their serum. The most important are anti-A and
anti-B antibodies, usually of IgM class. Immune antibodies,
on the other hand, are acquired in response to transfusion
and by transplacental passage during pregnancy. These are
warm antibodies, usually of IgG class.
ABO SYSTEM. This system consists of 3 major allelic genes:
A, B and O, located on the long arm of chromosome 9. These
genes control the synthesis of blood group antigens A and
B. The serum of an individual contains naturally-occurring
antibodies to A and/or B antigen, whichever antigen is
lacking in the person’s red cells (Table 13.4). Two subgroups
of A—A1 and A2, and thus of AB also, A1B and A2B, are
recognised but are of minor clinical significance. In routine
practice, the ABO type is determined by testing the red blood
cells with anti-A and anti-B and by testing the serum against
A, B and O red blood cells.
Red blood cells of type O and A2 have large amounts of
another antigen called H substance which is genetically
different from ABO but is a precursor of A and B antigens.
An O group individual who inherits A or B genes but fails to
inherit H gene from either parent is called Oh phenotype or
Bombay blood group. In such rare individual, despite the
presence of all the three antibodies in serum (anti-A, anti-B
and anti-H), the red cells are not agglutinated by the antisera.
RHESUS SYSTEM. The Rhesus (Rh) blood group system
was first discovered on human red cells by the use of antisera
prepared by immunising rabbits with red cells from a Rhesus
monkey. The Rh allelic genes are C or c, D or d and E or e,
located on chromosome 1. One set of 3 genes is inherited
from each parent giving rise to various complex
combinations. The corresponding antigens are similarly
named Cc, Ee  and only D since no d antigen exists.

However, out of all these, D antigen is most strongly
immunogenic and, therefore, clinically most important. In
practice, Rh grouping is performed with anti-D antiserum.
Individuals who are D-positive are referred to as Rh-positive
and those who lack D antigen are termed Rh-negative.
Practically, there are no naturally-occurring Rh anti-
bodies. All Rh antibodies in Rh-negative individuals are
acquired from immunisation such as by transfusion and
during pregnancy, resulting in fatal haemolytic transfusion
reaction and haemolytic disease of the newborn (described
later).
BLOOD TRANSFUSION
A pre-transfusion compatibility testing is essential prior to
any blood transfusion. The procedure consists of the
following:
1.
ABO and Rh(D) grouping of the patient (recipient).
2.
Antibody screening of the patient’s serum to detect the
presence of clinically significant antibodies.
3.
Selecting the donor blood of the same ABO and Rh group.
4.
Cross-matching the patient’s serum against donor red cells
to confirm donor-recipient compatibility.
The indications for blood transfusion are acute blood loss
and various haematologic disorders considered already. In
addition to the whole blood transfusion, the modern blood-
banking techniques have made it possible to transfuse blood
components such as packed red blood cells, platelets, white
blood cell concentrates, plasma components and plasma-
pheresis in specific situations.
Complications of Blood Transfusion
A carefully prepared and supervised blood transfusion is
quite safe. However, in 5-6% of transfusions, untoward
complications occur, some of which are minor while others
are more serious and at times fatal.
Transfusion reactions are generally classified into 2 types:
immune and non-immune.
I.
Immunologic transfusion reactions may be against red blood
cells (haemolytic reactions), leucocytes, platelets or
immunoglobulins.
II. Non-immune transfusion reactions include circulatory
overload, massive transfusion, or transmission of an
infectious agent.
These transfusion reactions are considered below.
I.
IMMUNOLOGIC TRANSFUSION REACTIONS.
These are as under:
1.
Haemolytic transfusion reactions. Haemolytic trans-
fusion reaction may be immediate or delayed, intravascular or
extravascular.
Very rapid cell destruction associated with intravascular
haemolysis is usually due to ABO incompatibility since both
naturally-occurring antibodies, anti-A and anti-B, are capable
of fixing complement. The symptoms include restlessness,
anxiety, flushing, chest or lumbar pain, tachypnoea,
tachycardia and nausea, followed by shock and renal failure.

340
SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
Extravascular haemolysis is more often due to immune
antibodies of the Rh system. The clinical manifestations are
relatively less severe and usually consist of malaise and fever
but shock and renal failure may rarely occur. Some patients
develop delayed reactions in which the patient develops
anaemia due to destruction of red cells in the RE system about
a week after transfusion. Such delayed reactions are generally
the result of previous transfusion or pregnancy (anamnestic
reaction).
2.
Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). This is
an uncommon reaction resulting from transfusion of donor
plasma containing high levels of anti-HLA antibodies which
bind to leucocytes of recipient. These leucocytes then
aggregate in pulmonary micromutation and release
mediators of increased vascular permeability resulting in
acute pulmonary oedema and signs and symptoms of
respiratory failure.
3.
Other allergic reactions. Besides haemolytic transfusion
reaction, others reactions are as follows:
i) Febrile reaction which is usually attributed to immunologic
reaction against white blood cells, platelets, or IgA class
immunoglobulins.
ii) Patients with antibodies against IgA molecule sometimes
develop anaphylactic shock on transfusion of blood from other
human subjects.
iii) Allergic reactions such as urticaria may occur.
iv) Transfusion-related graft-versus-host disease mediated by
donor T lymphocytes may occur.
II. NONIMMUNE TRANSFUSION REACTIONS. This
category includes the following adverse effects:
1.
Circulatory overload. Circulatory overload resulting in
pulmonary congestion and acute heart failure is the most
important and most common complication that may result
in death following transfusion. The risk of circulatory
overload is particularly high in patients with chronic
anaemia, and in infants and the elderly. The onset may be
immediate, or may be delayed up to 24 hours.
2.
Massive transfusion. When the volume of stored blood
transfused to bleeding patients exceeds their normal blood
volume, it results in dilutional thrombocytopenia and
dilution of coagulation factors.
3.
Transmission of infection. Many diseases can be
transmitted by transfusion of an infected blood. These
include: hepatitis (HBV, HCV), CMV infection, syphilis,
malaria, toxoplasmosis, infectious mononucleosis, brucellosis
and AIDS (HIV infection). The incidence increases in patients
who receive multiple transfusions such as cases of
haemophilia, thalassaemia major, acute leukaemias, acute
severe haemorrhage etc. It has, therefore, been mandatory
that prior to any human transfusion, every unit of blood must
be screened for the serologic testing of HIV, HBV, HCV and
syphilis and for the presence of malarial parasite.
4.
Air embolism. Air embolism is unlikely to occur if the
blood transfusion is carried out with plastic bags with
negative pressure as is the usual practice nowadays. A
debilitated person may develop symptomatic air embolism
even if a small volume (10-40 ml) makes its way into the
circulation, whereas a healthy individual is at lesser risk.
5.
Thrombophlebitis. The complication of thrombophlebitis
is more commonly associated with venesection for blood
transfusion, especially if it is done in the saphenous vein of
the ankle rather than the veins of the arm. The risk of
developing thrombophlebitis is further enhanced if the
transfusion is continued longer than 12 hours at a single site.
6.
Transfusion haemosiderosis. Post-transfusion iron
overload with deposition of iron in the tissues of the body
occurs after repeated transfusions in the absence of any blood
loss e.g. in thalassaemia major and in severe chronic
refractory anaemias. The body has no other means of getting
rid of extra iron except iron excretion at the rate of 1 mg per
day. A unit of whole blood (400 ml) contains about 250 mg
of iron. After approximately 100 units, the liver, myocardium
and endocrine glands are all damaged.
BLOOD COMPONENTS
Blood from donors is collected as whole blood in a suitable
anticoagulant. Nowadays it is a common practice to divide
whole blood into components which include: packed RBCs,
platelets, fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate.
The procedure consists of initial centrifugation at low
speed to separate whole blood into two parts: packed RBCs
and platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Subsequently, PRP is
centrifuged at high speed to yield two parts: random donor
platelets and FFP. Cryoprecipitates are obtained by thawing of
FFP followed by centrifugation. Apheresis is the technique of
direct collection of large excess of platelets from a single
donor.
Applications of these blood components in clinical use
are as under:
1. Packed RBCs. These are used to raise the oxygen-carrying
capacity of blood and are used in normovolaemic patients
of anaemia without cardiac disease. One unit of packed RBCs
may raise haemoglobin by 1 g/dl.
2. Platelets. Transfusion of platelets is done in patients of
thrombocytopenia who have haemorrhage. Optimally,
platelet transfusions can be given to a patient with platelet
count below 10,000/μl. Each unit of platelets can raise platelet
count by 5,000 to 10,000/μl.
3. Fresh frozen plasma. FFP contains plasma proteins and
coagulation factors that include albumin, protein C and S
and antithrombin. FFP transfusion in indicated in patients
of coagulation failure and TTP. Each unit of FFP raises
coagulation factors by about 2%.
4. Cryoprecipitate. Cryoprecipitate is a source of insoluble
plasma proteins, fibrinogen, factor VIII and vWF. Indications
for transfusion of cryoprecipitate are for patients requiring
fibrinogen, factor VIII and vWF. Transfusion of single unit
of cryoprecipitate yields about 80 IU of factor VIII.
HAEMOLYTIC DISEASE OF NEWBORN
Haemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) results from the
passage of IgG antibodies from the maternal circulation

341
CHAPTER 13
Disorders of Platelets, Bleeding Disorders and Basic Transfusion Medicine
across the placenta into the circulation of the foetal red cells.
Besides pregnancy, sensitisation of the mother may result
from previous abortions and previous blood transfusion.
HDN can occur from incompatibility of ABO or Rh blood
group system. ABO incompatibility is much more common
but the HDN in such cases is usually mild, while Rh-D
incompatibility results in more severe form of the HDN.
PATHOGENESIS. The pathogenesis of the two main forms
of HDN is different.
HDN due to Rh-D incompatibility. Rh incompatibility
occurs when a Rh-negative mother is sensitised to Rh-
positive blood. This results most often from a Rh-positive
foetus by passage of Rh-positive red cells across the placenta
into the circulation of Rh-negative mother. Normally, during
pregnancy very few foetal red cells cross the placenta but
haemorrhage during parturition causes significant
sensitisation of the mother. Sensitisation is more likely if the
mother and foetus are ABO compatible rather than ABO
incompatible. Though approximately 95% cases of Rh-HDN
are due to anti-D, some cases are due to combination of anti-
D with other immune antibodies of the Rh system such as
anti-C and anti-E, and rarely anti-c alone.
It must be emphasised here that the risk of sensitisation
of a Rh-negative woman married to Rh-positive man is small
in first pregnancy but increases during successive
pregnancies if prophylactic anti-D immunoglobulin is not
given within 72 hours after the first delivery. If both the
parents are Rh-D positive (homozygous), all the newborns
will be Rh-D positive, while if the father is Rh-D positive
(heterozygous), there is a 50% chance of producing a Rh-D
negative child.
HDN due to ABO incompatibility. About 20% pregnancies
with ABO incompatibility between the mother and the foetus
develop the HDN. Naturally-occurring anti-A and anti-B
antibodies’ which are usually of IgM class do not cross the
placenta, while immune anti-A and anti-B antibodies which
are usually of IgG class may cross the placenta into foetal
circulation and damage the foetal red cells. ABO HDN occurs
most frequently in infants born to group O mothers who
possess anti-A and/or anti-B IgG antibodies. ABO-HDN
differs from Rh(D)-HDN, in that it occurs in first pregnancy,
Coombs’ (antiglobulin) test is generally negative, and is less
severe than the latter.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The HDN due to Rh-D incompa-
tibility in its severest form may result in intrauterine death
from hydrops foetalis. Moderate disease produces a baby born
with severe anaemia and jaundice due to unconjugated
hyperbilirubinaemia. When the level of unconjugated
bilirubin exceeds 20 mg/dl, it may result in deposition of
bile pigment in the basal ganglia of the CNS called kernicterus
and result in permanent brain damage. Mild disease, however,
causes only severe anaemia with or without jaundice.
LABORATORY FINDINGS. The haematologic findings
in cord blood and mother’s blood are as under:
1. Cord blood shows variable degree of anaemia, reticulo-
cytosis, elevated serum bilirubin and a positive direct
Coombs’ test if the cord blood is Rh-D positive.
2. Mother’s blood is Rh-D negative with high plasma titre
of anti-D.
COURSE AND PROGNOSIS. The course in HDN may
range from death, to minimal haemolysis, to mental
retardation. The practice of administration of anti-Rh
immunoglobulin to the mother before or after delivery has
reduced the incidence of HDN as well as protects the mother
before the baby’s RBCs sensitise the mother’s blood.
Exchange transfusion of the baby is done to remove the
antibodies, remove red cells susceptible to haemolysis and
also to lower the bilirubin level.

As illustrated in Fig. 12.3, pluripotent stem cells in the bone
marrow divide to form two types of stem cells: myeloid
trilineage stem cells and lymphoid stem cells. Myeloid
trilineage stem cells further divide to form three types of cell
lines: erythroid progenitor cells (discussed in Chapter 12),
megakaryocytic progenitor cells (discussed in Chapter 13),
and granulocyte-monocyte progenitor cells. In this chapter,
we will discuss the abnormalities pertaining to the remaining
two cell lines—granulocyte-monocyte cell line and the
lymphoid cell lines, besides discussion on all haematopoietic
neoplasms. Both these cell lines constitute leucocyte pool in
the body at two distinct locations: in circulating blood and
in the tissues. This concept holds more true for lymphoid
cells in particular, which are present in circulation as well as
are distributed in the lymphoid tissues of the body (lymph
nodes, spleen, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue—MALT,
pharyngeal lymphoid tissue). B, T and NK lymphoid cells
are formed after differentiation from lymphopoietic
precursor cells in the bone marrow undergo further
maturation in peripheral lymphoid organs and thymus
(Chapter 4). Thus, relationship of haematopoietic tissues and
lymphoreticluar tissues is quite close. In fact, current
lymphoma-leukaemia classification system does not consider
diseases of lymphocytes in the blood and in the lymphoid
tissues as separate disorders but are seen to represent
different stages of the same biologic process. Hence, in
contemporary learning of these diseases, it is desirable to
study diseases of leucocytes together with diseases of
lymphoreticular tissues of the body.
LYMPH NODES: NORMAL AND REACTIVE
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The lymph nodes are bean-shaped or oval structures varying
in length from 1 to 2 cm and form the part of lymphatic
network distributed throughout the body. Each lymph node
is covered by a connective tissue capsule. At the convex
surface of the capsule several afferent lymphatics enter which
drain into the peripheral subcapsular sinus, branch into the
lymph node and terminate at the concavity (hilum) as a single
efferent lymphatic vessel. These lymphatic vessels are lined
by mononuclear phagocytic cells.
The inner structure of the lymph node is divided into a
peripheral cortex and central medulla. The cortex consists of
several rounded aggregates of lymphocytes called lymphoid
follicles. The follicle has a pale-staining germinal centre
surrounded by small dark-staining lymphocytes called the
mantle zone. The deeper region of the cortex or paracortex is
the zone between the peripheral cortex and the inner medulla.
The medulla is predominantly composed of cords of plasma
cells and some lymphocytes. The capsule and the structure
within the lymph node are connected by supportive delicate
reticulin framework (Fig. 14.1,A).
Functionally, the lymph node is divided into T and B
lymphocyte zones:
B-cell zone lies in the follicles in the cortex, the mantle
zone and the interfollicular space, while plasma cells are also
present in the interfollicular zone.
T-cell zone is predominantly present in the medulla.
 There are two main functions of the lymph node—to
mount immune response in the body, and to perform the
function of active phagocytosis for particulate material.
Besides T and B-cells, the follicular centre has dendritic
histiocytes and antigen-presenting Langerhans’ histiocytes
(formerly together called tingible body macrophages due to
engulfment of particulate material by them) and endothelial
cells. The follicular centre is a very active zone where
lymphocytes from peripheral blood continuously enter and
leave, interact with macrophage-histiocytes and endothelial
cells and undergo maturation  and transformation.
Lymphocytes and endothelial cells have surface molecules
which interact and serve as ‘addresses’ so that endothelial
cells can direct the lymphocytes; these molecules are
appropriately termed as addressins or homing receptors.
Peripheral blood B and T lymphocytes on entering the lymph
node are stimulated immunologically which transforms them
to undergo cytoplasmic and nuclear maturation which may
be in the follicular centre or paracortex as per following
sequence and schematically depicted in Fig. 14.1,B:
i) Follicular centre, small non-cleaved cells or centroblasts
ii) Follicular centre, small cleaved cells or centrocytes
iii) Follicular centre, large cleaved cells
iv) Follicular centre, large non-cleaved cells
v) Immunoblasts (in paracortex)
vi) Convoluted cells or lymphoblasts (in paracortex)
vii) Plasma cells.
Lymph nodes are secondarily involved in a variety of
systemic diseases, local injuries and infections, and are also
the site for some important primary neoplasms. Many of
these diseases such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis,
histoplasmosis, typhoid fever, viral infections etc. have been
considered elsewhere in the textbook along with description
of these primary diseases. Reactive lymphadenitis is
discussed below while the subject of lymphoid neoplasms
including plasma cell disorders and Langerhans’ cell
histiocytosis is discussed under haematologic neoplasms.

CHAPTER 14
Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues
REACTIVE LYMPHADENITIS
Lymph nodes undergo reactive changes in response to a wide
variety of stimuli which include microbial infections, drugs,
environmental pollutants, tissue injury, immune-complexes
and malignant neoplasms. However, the most common
causes of lymph node enlargement are inflammatory and
immune reactions, aside from primary malignant neoplasms
and metastatic tumour deposits. Those due to primary
inflammatory reaction are termed reactive lymphadenitis, and
those due to primary immune reactions are referred to as
lymphadenopathy.
Reactive lymphadenitis is a nonspecific response and is
categorised into acute and chronic types, each with a few
variant forms.
Acute Nonspecific Lymphadenitis
All kinds of acute inflammations may cause acute nonspecific
lymphadenitis in the nodes draining the area of inflamed
tissue. Most common causes are microbiologic infections or
their breakdown products, and foreign bodies in the wound
or into the circulation etc. Most frequently involved lymph
nodes are: cervical (due to infections in the oral cavity), axillary
(due to infection in the arm), inguinal (due to infection in the
lower extremities), and mesenteric (due to acute appendicitis,
acute enteritis etc).
Acute lymphadenitis is usually mild and transient but
occasionally it may be more severe. Acutely inflamed nodes
are enlarged, tender, and if extensively involved, may be
fluctuant. The overlying skin is red and hot. After control of
infection, majority of cases heal completely without leaving
any scar. If the inflammation does not subside, acute
lymphadenitis changes into chronic lymphadenitis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the affected
lymph nodes are enlarged 2-3 times their normal size and
may show abscess formation if the involvement is
extensive.
Microscopically, the sinusoids are congested, widely
dilated and oedematous and contain numerous neutro-
phils. The lymphoid follicles are prominent with presence
of many mitoses and phagocytosis. In more severe cases,
necrosis may occur and neutrophil abscesses may form.
Chronic Nonspecific Lymphadenitis
Chronic nonspecific lymphadenitis, commonly called reactive
lymphoid hyperplasia, is a common form of inflammatory
reaction of draining lymph nodes as a response to antigenic
stimuli such as repeated attacks of acute lymphadenitis and
lymph from malignant tumours.
Depending upon the pattern in chronic nonspecific
lymphadenitis, three types are distinguished, each having
its own set of causes. These are: follicular hyperplasia,
paracortical hyperplasia and sinus histiocytosis. However, mixed
patterns may also be seen in which case one of the patterns
predominates over the others.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the affected
lymph nodes are usually enlarged, firm and non-tender.
Microscopically, the features of 3 patterns of reactive
lymphoid hyperplasia are as under:
1.
Follicular hyperplasia is the most frequent pattern,
particularly encountered in children. Besides nonspecific
stimulation, a few specific causes are: rheumatoid arthritis,
toxoplasmosis, syphilis and AIDS. The microscopic
features are as follows (Fig. 14.2):
i)
There is marked enlargement and prominence of the
germinal centres of lymphoid follicles (proliferation of B-
cell areas) due to the presence of numerous mitotically
active lymphocytes and proliferation of phagocytic cells
containing phagocytosed material.
ii) Parafollicular and medullary regions are more cellular
and contain plasma cells, histiocytes, and some
neutrophils and eosinophils.
iii) There is hyperplasia of mononuclear phagocytic cells
lining the lymphatic sinuses in the lymph node.
Angiofollicular lymphoid hyperplasia or Castleman’s
disease is a clinicopathologic variant of follicular

Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
hyperplasia. The condition may occur at any age and
possibly has an association with Epstein-Barr virus
infection. Two histologic forms are distinguished:
i)
Hyaline-vascular type is more common (90% cases) and
is characterised by the presence of hyalinised arterioles
in small lymphoid follicles and proliferation of vessels in
the interfollicular area.
ii) Plasma cell form is less common and is characterised
by plasma cell hyperplasia and vascular proliferation in
the interfollicular region.
2.
Paracortical lymphoid hyperplasia is due to hyper-
plasia of T-cell-dependent area of the lymph node.
Amongst the important causes are immunologic reactions
caused by drugs (e.g. dilantin), vaccination, viruses (e.g.
infectious mononucleosis) and autoimmune disorders. Its
histologic features are:
i)
Expansion of the paracortex (T-cell area) with increa-
sed number of T-cell transformed immunoblasts.
ii) Encroachment by the enlarged paracortex on the
lymphoid follicles, sometimes resulting in their efface-
ment.
iii) Hyperplasia of the mononuclear phagocytic cells in
the lymphatic sinuses.
Variants of paracortical lymphoid hyperplasia are
angio-immunoblastic lymphadenopathy, dermatopathic
lymphadenopathy, dilantin lymphadenopathy and post-
vaccinial lymphadenopathy.
Angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy is characterised
by diffuse hyperplasia of immunoblasts rather than
paracortical hyperplasia only, and there is proliferation
of blood vessels. The condition occurs in elderly patients
with generalised lymph node enlargement and
hypergammaglobulinaemia.
Dermatopathic lymphadenopathy occurs in lymph node
draining an area of skin lesion. Besides the hyperplastic
paracortex, there is presence of dark melanin pigment
within the macrophages in the lymph node.
3.
Sinus histiocytosis or sinus hyperplasia is a very
common type found in regional lymph nodes draining
inflammatory lesions, or as an immune reaction of the host
to a draining malignant tumour or its products. The
hallmark of histologic diagnosis is the expansion of the
sinuses by proliferating large histiocytes containing
phagocytosed material (Fig. 14.3). The presence of sinus
histiocytosis in the draining lymph nodes of carcinoma
such as in breast carcinoma has been considered by some
workers to confer better prognosis in such patients due to
good host immune response.
Sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy is
characterised by marked enlargement of lymph nodes,
especially of the neck, in young adolescents. It is associated
with characteristic clinical features of painless but massive
lymphadenopathy with fever and leucocytosis and
usually runs a benign and self-limiting course.
HIV-related Lymphadenopathy
HIV infection and AIDS have already been discussed in
Chapter 4; here one of the frequent finding in early cases of
AIDS, persistent generalised lymphadenopathy (PGL), is
described. The presence of enlarged lymph nodes of more
than 1 cm diameter at two or more extra-inguinal sites for
more than 3 months without any other obvious cause is
frequently the earliest symptom of primary HIV infection.
Histologically, the findings at biopsy of involved lymph
node vary depending upon the stage of HIV infection:
1.
In the early stage marked follicular hyperplasia is the
dominant finding and reflects the polyclonal
B-cell proliferation.
2
In the intermediate stage, there is a combination of
follicular hyperplasia and follicular involution. However,
adenopathic form of Kaposi’s sarcoma too may develop
at this stage (page 414).
3.
In the last stage, there is decrease in the lymph node
size indicative of prognostic marker of disease

CHAPTER 14
Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues
progression. Microscopic findings of node at this stage
reveal follicular involution and lymphocyte depletion. At
this stage, other stigmata of AIDS in the lymph node may
also appear e.g. lymphoma, mycobacterial infection,
toxoplasmosis, systemic fungal infections etc.
WHITE BLOOD CELLS:
NORMAL AND REACTIVE
The leucocytes of the peripheral blood are of 2 main varieties,
distinguished by the presence or absence of granules:
granulocytes and nongranular leucocytes. The granulocytes,
according to the appearance of nuclei, are subdivided into
polymorphonuclear leucocytes and monocytes. Further,
depending upon the colour of granules, polymorphonuclear
leucocytes are of 3 types: neutrophils, eosinophils and
basophils. The nongranular leucocytes are 3 types of
lymphocytes: T, B and natural killer (NK) cells.
GRANULOPOIESIS
Site of Formation and Kinetics
All forms of granulocytes are produced in the bone marrow
and are termed,‘myeloid series’. Myeloid series include
maturing stages: myeloblast (most primitive precursor),
promyelocyte, myelocyte, metamyelocyte, band forms and
segmented granulocyte (mature form). The myeloblast,
promyelocyte and myelocyte form a ‘proliferative or mitotic
pool’, while the remainder (i.e. metamyelocyte, band forms
and segmented granulocytes) make up a ‘mature or post-
mitotic pool’. It takes about 12 days for formation of mature
granulocytes from the myeloblast. Normally the bone
marrow contains more myeloid cells than the erythroid cells
in the ratio of 2:1 to 15:1 (average 3:1), the largest proportion
being that of metamyelocytes, band forms and segmented
neutrophils.
Normally, the bone marrow storage compartment
contains about 10-15 times the number of granulocytes found
in the peripheral blood. Following their release from the bone
marrow, granulocytes spend about 10 hours in the circulation
before they move into the tissues, where they perform their
respective functions. The blood pool of granulocytes consists
of 2 components of about equal size—the circulating pool that
is included in the blood count, and the marginating pool that
is not included in the blood count. Granulocytes spend about
4-5 days in the tissues before they are either destroyed during
phagocytosis or die due to senescence. To control the various
compartments of granulocytes, a ‘feed-back system’ exists
between the circulating and tissue granulocytes on one side,
and the marrow granulocytes on the other. The presence of
a humoral regulatory substance, ‘granulopoietin’ analogous
to erythropoietin has also been identified by in vitro studies
of colony-forming units (CFU) and is characterised as G-CSF
(granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) and GM-CSF
(granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor).
The kinetics of monocytes is less well understood than
that of other myeloid cells. Monocytes spend about 20-40
hours in the circulation after which they leave the blood to
enter extravascular tissues where they perform their main
function of active phagocytosis. The extravascular lifespan
of tissue macrophages which are the transformed form of
blood monocytes, may vary from a few months to a few years.
Myeloid Series
The development of myeloid cells from myeloblast takes
place in the following sequence (Fig. 14.4):
1.
MYELOBLAST. The myeloblast is the earliest
recognisable precursor of the granulocytes, normally
comprising about 2% of the total marrow cells. The myelo-
blast varies considerably in size (10-18 μm in diameter),
having a large round to oval nucleus nearly filling the cell,
has fine nuclear chromatin and contains 2-5 well-defined pale
nucleoli. The thin rim of cytoplasm is deeply basophilic and
devoid of granules. The myeloblasts of acute myeloid
leukaemia may, however, show the presence of rod-like
cytoplasmic inclusions called Auer’s rods which represent
abnormal derivatives of primary azurophilic granules.
The nuclei of successive stages during their development
from myeloblast become progressively coarser and lose their
nucleoli and the cytoplasm loses its blue colour. As the cells
become mature lysosomal granules appear; firstly non-
specific primary or azurophilic granules appear which are
followed by specific or secondary granules that differentiate
the neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils.
2.
PROMYELOCYTE. The promyelocyte is slightly larger
than the myeloblast (12-18 μm diameter). It possesses a round
to oval nucleus, having fine nuclear chromatin which is
slightly condensed around the nuclear membrane. The
nucleoli are present but are less prominent and fewer than
those in the myeloblast. The main distinction of promyelocyte
from myeloblast is in the cytoplasm which contains
azurophilic (primary or non-specific) granules.
3.
MYELOCYTE. The myelocyte is the stage in which
specific or secondary granules appear in the cytoplasm, and
accordingly, the cell can be identified at this stage as
belonging to the neutrophilic, eosinophilic or basophilic
myelocyte. Primary granules also persist at this stage but
formation of new primary granules stops. The nucleus of
myelocyte is eccentric, round to oval, having somewhat
coarse nuclear chromatin and no visible nucleoli. The
myeloid cells up to the myelocyte stage continue to divide
and, therefore, comprise mitotic or proliferative pool.
4.
METAMYELOCYTE. The metamyelocyte stage is 10-18
μm in diameter and is characterised by a clearly indented or
horseshoe-shaped nucleus without nucleoli. The nuclear
chromatin is dense and clumped. The cytoplasm contains
both primary and secondary granules. The metamyelocytes
are best distinguished from the monocytes by the clumped
nuclear chromatin while the latter have fine chromatin.
5.
BAND FORMS. Band form is juvenile granulocyte, 10-
16 μm in diameter, characterised by further condensation of
nuclear chromatin and transformation of nuclear shape into
band configuration of uniform thickness.

346
SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
6.
SEGMENTED GRANULOCYTES. The mature poly-
morphonuclear leucocytes, namely: the neutrophils, eosino-
phils and basophils, are described separately below.
Common surface markers for all stages of myeloid series
of cells are CD33, CD13 and CD15. However, stages from
myelocytes to mature neutrophils also carry CD11b and
CD14. Band forms and mature neutrophils have further CD
10 and CD16.
Monocyte-Macrophage Series
The monocyte-macrophage series of cells, though comprise
a part of myeloid series alongwith other granulocytic series,
but are described separately here in view of different
morphologic stages in their maturation (Fig. 14.4).
1.
MONOBLAST. The monoblast is the least mature of the
recognisable cell of monocyte-macrophage series. It is very
similar in appearance to myeloblasts except that it has
ground-glass cytoplasm with irregular border and may show
phagocytosis as indicated by the presence of engulfed red
cells in the cytoplasm. However, differentiation from
myeloblast at times may be difficult even by electron
microscopy and, therefore, it is preferable to call the earliest
precursor of granulocytic series as myelomonoblast.
2.
PROMONOCYTE. The promonocyte is a young mono-
cyte, about 20 μm in diameter and possesses a large indented
nucleus containing a nucleolus. The cytoplasm is basophilic
and contains no azurophilic granules but may have fine
granules which are larger than those in the mature monocyte.
3.
MONOCYTE. The mature form of monocytic series is
described below, while the transformed stages of these cells
in various tissues (i.e. macrophages) are a part of RE system
discussed in Chapter 4.
Monocyte-macrophage series having specialised function
of phagocytosis secrete active products such as lysozyme,
neutral proteases, acid hydrolases, components of
complement, tranferrin, fibronectin, nucleosides  and several
cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18). They express
lineage-specific molecules CD 14, cell surface LPS receptors
etc.
LYMPHOPOIESIS
Sites of Formation and Kinetics
The lymphocytes and the plasma cells are immunocompetent
cells of the body. In man, the bone marrow and the thymus
are the primary lymphopoietic organs where lymphoid stem
cells undergo spontaneous division independent of antigenic
stimulation. The secondary or reactive lymphoid tissue is
comprised by the lymph nodes, spleen and gut-associated
lymphoid tissue (GALT). These sites actively produce
lymphocytes from the germinal centres of lymphoid follicles
as a response to antigenic stimulation. Lymphocytes pass
Figure 14.4
Granulopoiesis and the cellular compartments of myeloid cells in the bone marrow, blood and tissues.

347
CHAPTER 14
Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues
through a series of developmental changes in the course of
their evolution into lymphocyte subpopulations and subsets.
It includes migration of immature lymphocytes to other
organs such as the thymus where locally-produced factors
act on them.
Functionally, the lymphocytes are divided into T, B and
natural killer (NK) cells depending upon whether they are
immunologically active in cell-mediated immunity (T cells),
in humoral antibody response (B cells) or form part of the
natural or innate immunity and act as killer of some viruses
(NK cells). In man, the B cells are derived from the bone
marrow stem cells, while in birds they mature in the bursa
of Fabricius. After antigenic activation, B cells proliferate and
mature into plasma cells which secrete specific immuno-
globulin antibodies. The T cells are also produced in the bone
marrow and possibly in the thymus. NK cells do not have B
or T cell markers, nor are these cells dependent upon thymus
for development. The concept of T, B and NK cells along
with lymphocyte subpopulations and their functions is
discussed in Chapter 4.
Lymphoid Series
The maturation stages in production of lymphocytes are
illustrated in Fig. 14.5 and are as under:
1.
LYMPHOBLAST. The lymphoblast is the earliest identi-
fiable precursor of lymphoid cells and is a rapidly dividing
cell. It is a large cell, 10-18 μm in diameter, containing a large
round to oval nucleus having slightly clumped or stippled
nuclear chromatin. The nuclear membrane is denser and the
number of nucleoli is fewer (1-2) as compared with those in
myeloblast (2-5). The cytoplasm is scanty, basophilic and non-
granular.
The distinguishing morphologic features between the
myeloblast and lymphoblast are summarised in Table 14.1.
2.
PROLYMPHOCYTE. This stage is an intermediate stage
between the lymphoblast and mature lymphocyte. These
young lymphocytes are 9-18 μm in diameter, contain round
to indented nucleus with slightly stippled or coarse
chromatin and may have 0-1 nucleoli.
3.
LYMPHOCYTE. The mature lymphocytes are described
below.
MATURE LEUCOCYTES IN HEALTH AND
REACTION IN DISEASE
Normally, only mature leucocytes namely: polymorphs,
lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils, are
found in the peripheral blood. The normal range of total and
differential leucocyte count (TLC and DLC expressed
sequentially as P, L, M, E, B) in health in adults and children
is given in Table 14.2. White cell count tends to be higher in
infants and children than in adults. It also normally
undergoes minor degree of diurnal variation with a slight
rise in the afternoon. The total white cell count is normally
high in pregnancy and following delivery, usually returning
to normal within a week. The pathological variations in white
cell values together with brief review of their morphology
and functions are considered below (Fig. 14.6):
Polymorphs (Neutrophils)
MORPHOLOGY. A polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN),
commonly called polymorph or neutrophil, is 12-15 μm in
diameter. It consists of a characteristic dense nucleus, having
2-5 lobes and pale cytoplasm containing numerous fine
violet-pink granules. These lysosomal granules contain
several enzymes and are of 2 types:
Primary or azurophilic granules are large and coarse and
appear early at the promyelocyte stage. These granules

SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
contain hydrolases, elastase, myeloperoxidase, cathepsin-G,
cationic proteins, permeability increasing protein, and
microbicidal protein called defensins.
Secondary or specific granules are smaller and more
numerous. These appear later at myelocyte stage, are MPO-
negative and contain lactoferrin, NADPH oxidase,
histaminase, vitamin B12 binding protein, and receptors for
chemoattractants and for laminin.
The normal functions of neutrophils are as under:
1.
Chemotaxis or cell mobilisation in which the cell is
attracted towards bacteria or at the site of inflammation.
2.
Phagocytosis in which the foreign particulate material of
tiny sizes is phagocytosed by actively motile neutrophils;
thus PMNs act as microphages compared to function of
monocytes as macrophages.
3.
Killing of the microorganism is mediated by oxygen-
dependent and oxygen-independent pathways (Chapter 3).
PATHOLOGIC VARIATIONS. Pathologic variations in
neutrophils include variations in count, morphology and
defective function.
Variation in count. An increase in neutrophil count (neutro-
phil leucocytosis or neutrophilia) or a decrease in count
(neutropenia) may occur in various diseases.
Neutrophil leucocytosis. An increase in circulating
neutrophils above 7,500/μl is the commonest type of
leucocytosis and occurs most commonly as a response to
acute bacterial infections. Some common causes of
neutrophilia are as under:
1.
Acute infections, local or generalised, especially by cocci but
also by certain bacilli, fungi, spirochaetes, parasites and some
viruses. For example: pneumonia, cholecystitis, salpingitis,
meningitis, diphtheria, plague, peritonitis, appendicitis,
actinomycosis, poliomyelitis, abscesses, furuncles,
carbuncles, tonsillitis, otitis media, osteomyelitis etc.
2.
Other inflammations e.g. tissue damage resulting from
burns, operations, ischaemic necrosis (such as in MI), gout,
collagen-vascular diseases, hypersensitivity reactions etc.
3.
Intoxication e.g. uraemia, diabetic ketosis, eclampsia,
poisonings by chemicals and drugs.
4.
Acute haemorrhage, internal or external.
5.
Acute haemolysis.
6.
Disseminated malignancies.
7.
Myeloproliferative disorders e.g. myeloid leukaemia,
polycythaemia vera, myeloid metaplasia.
8.
Miscellaneous e.g. following corticosteroid therapy, idio-
pathic neutrophilia.
Neutropenia. When the absolute neutrophil count falls below
2,500/μl, the patient is said to have neutropenia and is prone
to develop recurrent infections. Some common causes of
neutropenia (and hence leucopenia) are as follows:
1.
Certain infections e.g. typhoid, paratyphoid, brucellosis,
influenza, measles, viral hepatitis, malaria, kala-azar etc.
2.
Overwhelming bacterial infections especially in patients with
poor resistance e.g. miliary tuberculosis, septicaemia.
3.
Drugs, chemicals and physical agents which induce aplasia
of the bone marrow cause neutropenia, e.g. antimetabolites,
nitrogen mustards, benzene, ionising radiation. Occasionally,
certain drugs produce neutropenia due to individual
sensitivity such as: anti-inflammatory (amidopyrine, phenyl-
butazone), antibacterial (chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole),
anticonvulsants, antithyroids, hypoglycaemics and
antihistaminics.
4.
Certain haematological and other diseases e.g. pernicious
anaemia, aplastic anaemia, cirrhosis of the liver with spleno-
megaly, SLE, Gaucher’s disease.
5.
Cachexia and debility.
6.
Anaphylactoid shock.
7.
Certain rare hereditary, congenital or familial disorders e.g.
cyclic neutropenia, primary splenic neutropenia, idiopathic
benign neutropenia.
VARIATIONS IN MORPHOLOGY. Some of the common
variations in neutrophil morphology are shown in Fig. 14.7.
These are as under:
1.
Granules. Heavy, dark staining, coarse toxic granules are
characteristic of bacterial infections.
2.
Vacuoles. In bacterial infections such as in septicaemia,
cytoplasmic vacuolation may develop.
3.
Döhle bodies. These are small, round or oval patches,
2-3 μm in size, in the cytoplasm. They are mostly seen in
bacterial infections.
4.
Nuclear abnormalities. These include the following:
i)
Sex chromatin is a normal finding in 2-3% of neutrophils
in female sex. It consists of a drumstick appendage of
chromatin, about 1 μm across, and attached to one of the
nuclear lobes by a thin chromatin strand. Their presence in
more than 20% of PMNs is indicative of female sex
chromosomes (Chapter 10).
ii) A ‘shift-to-left’ is the term used for appearance of neutro-
phils with decreased number of nuclear lobes in the
peripheral blood e.g. presence of band and stab forms and a
few myelocytes in the peripheral blood. It is seen in severe
infections, leucoerythroblastic reaction or leukaemia.
iii) A ‘shift-to-right’ is appearance of hypersegmented (more
than 5 nuclear lobes) neutrophils in the peripheral blood such

CHAPTER 14
Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues
as in megaloblastic anaemia, uraemia, and sometimes in
leukaemia.
iv) Pelger-Huët anomaly is an uncommon autosomal
dominant inherited disorder in which nuclei in majority of
neutrophils are distinctively bilobed (spectacle-shaped) and
coarsely staining chromatin. Acquired pseudo-Pelger-Huët
abnormality may occur in acute infections or in MDS.
However, the physiologic role of multilobed nucleus of
neutrophils is unknown and the bilobed anomaly is an
innocuous condition.
DEFECTIVE FUNCTIONS. The following abnormalities in
neutrophil function may sometimes be found:
1.
Defective chemotaxis e.g. in a rare congenital abnor-
mality called lazy-leucocyte syndrome; following cortico-
steroid therapy, aspirin ingestion, alcoholism, and in myeloid
leukaemia.
2.
Defective phagocytosis due to lack of opsonisation e.g.
in hypogammaglobulinaemia, hypocomplementaemia, after
splenectomy, in sickle cell disease.
3.
Defective killing e.g. in chronic granulomatous disease,
Chédiak-Higashi syndrome, myeloid leukaemias.
Lymphocytes
MORPHOLOGY. Majority of lymphocytes in the peripheral
blood are small (9-12 μm in diameter) but large lymphocytes
(12-16 μm in diameter) are also found. Both small and large
lymphocytes have round or slightly indented nucleus with
coarsely-clumped chromatin and scanty basophilic
cytoplasm. Plasma cells are derived from B lymphocytes
under the influence of appropriate stimuli. The nucleus of
plasma cell is eccentric and has cart-wheel pattern of clumped
nuclear chromatin. The cytoplasm is characteristically deeply
basophilic with a pale perinuclear zone. Plasma cells are
normally not present in peripheral blood but their patho-
logical proliferation occurs in myelomatosis. Reactive
lymphocytes (or Turk cells or plasmacytoid lymphocytes)
are seen in certain viral infections and have sufficiently
basophilic cytoplasm that they resemble plasma cells.
 As discussed in Chapter 4, functionally, there are 3 types
of lymphocytes and possess distinct surface markers called
clusters of differentiation (CD) which aid in identification of
stage of their differentiation:
T lymphocytes i.e. thymus-dependent lymphocytes, which
mature in the thymus and are also known as thymocytes.
They are mainly involved in direct action on antigens and
are therefore involved in cell-mediated immune (CMI) reaction
by its subsets such as cytotoxic (killer) T cells (CD3+), CD8+
T cells, and delayed hypersensitivity reaction by CD4+ T cells.
B lymphocytes i.e. bone marrow-dependent or bursa-
equivalent lymphocytes  as well as their derivatives, plasma
cells, are the source of specific immunoglobulin antibodies.
They are, therefore, involved in humoral immunity (HI) or
circulating immune reactions.
NK cells i.e. natural killer cells are those lymphocytes which
morphologically have appearance of lymphocytes but do not
possess functional features of T or B cells. As the name
indicates they are identified with ‘natural’ or innate immunity
and bring about direct ‘killing’ of microorganisms
(particularly certain viruses) or lysis of foreign body.
PATHOLOGIC VARIATIONS. A rise in the absolute count
of lymphocytes exceeding the upper limit of normal (above
4,000/μm) is termed lymphocytosis, while absolute lympho-
cyte count below 1,500/μm is referred to as lymphopenia.
Lymphocytosis. Some of the common causes of lympho-
cytosis are as under:
1.
Certain acute infections e.g. pertussis, infectious
mononucleosis, viral hepatitis, infectious lymphocytosis.
2.
Certain chronic infections e.g. brucellosis, tuberculosis,
secondary syphilis.
3.
Haematopoietic disorders e.g. lymphocytic leukaemias,
lymphoma, heavy chain disease.
4.
Relative lymphocytosis is found in viral exanthemas,
convalescence from acute infections, thyrotoxicosis,
conditions causing neutropenia.
Lymphopenia. Lymphopenia is uncommon and occurs in
the following conditions:
1.
Most acute infections.
2.
Severe bone marrow failure.
3.
Corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy.
4.
Widespread irradiation.
Monocytes
MORPHOLOGY. The monocyte is the largest mature
leucocyte in the peripheral blood measuring 12-20 μm in
Figure 14.7
Common variations in neutrophil morphology.

350
SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
diameter. It possesses a large, central, oval, notched or
indented or horseshoe-shaped nucleus which has
characteristically fine reticulated chromatin network. The
cytoplasm is abundant, pale blue and contains many fine
dust-like granules and vacuoles.
The main functions of monocytes are as under:
1.
Phagocytosis of antigenic material or microorganisms.
2.
Immunologic function as antigen-presenting cells and
present the antigen to lymphocytes to deal with further.
3.
As mediator of inflammation, they are involved in release
of prostaglandins, stimulation of the liver to secrete acute
phase reactants.
Tissue macrophages of different types included in RE
system are derived from blood monocytes (Chapter 4).
PATHOLOGIC VARIATIONS. A rise in the blood mono-
cytes above 800/μl is termed monocytosis. Some common
causes of monocytosis are as follows:
1.
Certain bacterial infections e.g. tuberculosis, subacute
bacterial endocarditis, syphilis.
2.
Viral infections.
3.
Protozoal and rickettsial infections e.g. malaria, typhus,
trypanosomiasis, kala-azar.
4.
Convalescence from acute infection.
5.
Haematopoietic disorders e.g. monocytic leukaemia,
lymphomas, myeloproliferative disorders, multiple
myeloma, lipid storage disease.
6.
Malignancies e.g. cancer of the ovary, stomach, breast.
7.
Granulomatous diseases e.g. sarcoidosis, inflammatory
bowel disease.
8.
Collagen-vascular diseases.
Eosinophils
MORPHOLOGY. Eosinophils are similar to segmented
neutrophils in size (12-15 μm in diameter), and have coarse,
deep red staining granules in the cytoplasm and have usually
two nuclear lobes. Granules in eosinophils contain basic
protein and stain more intensely for peroxidase than granules
in the neutrophils. In addition, eosinophils also contain cell
adhesion molecules, cytokines (IL-3, IL-5), and a protein that
precipitates Charcot-Leyden crystals in lung tissues in
asthmatic patients.
Eosinophils are involved in reactions to foreign proteins
and to antigen-antibody reactions.
PATHOLOGIC VARIATIONS. An increase in the number
of eosinophilic leucocytes above 400/μl is referred to as
eosinophilia and below 40/μl is termed as eosinopenia.
Eosinophilia. The causes are as under:
1.
Allergic disorders e.g. bronchial asthma, urticaria,
angioneurotic oedema, hay fever, drug hypersensitivity.
2.
Parasitic infestations e.g. trichinosis, echinococcosis,
intestinal parasitism.
3.
Skin diseases e.g. pemphigus, dermatitis herpetiformis,
erythema multiforme.
4.
Löeffler’s syndrome.
5.
Pulmonary infiltration with eosinophilia (PIE) syndrome.
6.
Tropical eosinophilia.
7.
Haematopoietic diseases e.g. CML, polycythaemia vera,
pernicious anaemia, Hodgkin’s disease, following
splenectomy.
8.
Malignant diseases with metastases.
9.
Irradiation.
10. Miscellaneous disorders e.g. polyarteritis nodosa, rheuma-
toid arthritis, sarcoidosis.
Eosinopenia. Adrenal steroids and ACTH induce eosino-
penia in man.
Basophils
MORPHOLOGY. Basophils resemble the other mature
granulocytes but are distinguished by coarse, intensely
basophilic granules which usually fill the cytoplasm and
often overlie and obscure the nucleus.
The granules of circulating basophils (as well as their
tissue counterparts as mast cells) contain heparin, histamine
and 5-HT. Mast cells or basophils on degranulation are
associated with histamine release.
PATHOLOGIC VARIATIONS. Basophil leucocytosis or
basophilia refers to an increase in the number of basophilic
leucocytes above 100/μl. Basophilia is unusual and is found
in the following conditions:
1.
Chronic myeloid leukaemia
2.
Polycythaemia vera
3.
Myelosclerosis
4.
Myxoedema
5.
Ulcerative colitis
6.
Following splenectomy
7.
Hodgkin’s disease
8.
Urticaria pigmentosa.
INFECTIOUS MONONUCLEOSIS
Infectious mononucleosis (IM) or glandular fever is a benign,
self-limiting lymphoproliferative disease caused by Epstein-
Barr virus (EBV), one of the herpesviruses. Infection may
occur from childhood to old age but the classical acute
infection is more common in teenagers and young adults.
The infection is transmitted by person-to-person contact such
as by kissing with transfer of virally-contaminated saliva.
Groups of cases occur particularly in young people living
together in boarding schools, colleges, camps and military
institutions. Primary infection in childhood is generally
asymptomatic, while 50% of adults develop clinical
manifestations. The condition is so common that by the age
of 40, most people have been infected and developed
antibodies. It may be mentioned here that EBV is oncogenic
as well and is strongly implicated in the African (endemic)
Burkitt’s lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma as
discussed in Chapter 8.
Pathogenesis
EBV, the etiologic agent for IM, is a B lymphotropic
herpesvirus. The disease is characterised by fever, genera-
lised lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, sore throat,

351
CHAPTER 14
Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues
and appearance in blood of atypical ‘mononucleosis cells’.
The pathogenesis of these pathologic features is outlined
below:
1.
In a susceptible sero-negative host who lacks antibodies,
the virus in the contaminated saliva invades and replicates
within epithelial cells of the salivary gland and then enters B
cells in the lymphoid tissues which possess receptors for EBV.
The infection spreads throughout the body via bloodstream
or by infected B cells.
2.
Viraemia and death of infected B cells cause an acute
febrile illness and appearance of specific humoral antibodies
which peak about 2 weeks after the infection and persist
throughout life. The appearance of antibodies marks the
disappearance of virus from the blood.
3.
Though the viral agent has disappeared from the blood,
the EBV-infected B cells continue to be present in the
circulation as latent infection. EBV-infected B cells undergo
polyclonal activation and proliferation. These cells perform two
important roles which are the characteristic diagnostic
features of IM:
i)
They secrete antibodies—initially IgM but later IgG class
antibodies appear. IgM antibody is the heterophile anti-
sheep antibody used for diagnosis of IM while IgG
antibody persists for life and provides immunity against
re-infection.
ii) They activate CD8+ T lymphocytes— also called cytotoxic
T cells (or CTL) or suppressor T cells. CD8+ T cells bring
about killing of B cells and are pathognomonic atypical
lymphocytes seen in blood in IM.
4.
The proliferation of these cells is responsible for
generalised lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly.
5.
The sore throat in IM may be caused by either necrosis of
B cells or due to viral replication within the salivary epithelial
cells in early stage.
Besides the involvement of EBV in the pathogenesis of
IM, its role in neoplastic transformation in nasopharyngeal
carcinoma and Burkitt’s lymphoma is discussed in
Chapter 8 and diagrammatically depicted in Fig. 14.8.
Clinical Features
The incubation period of IM is 30-50 days in young adults,
while children have shorter incubation period. A prodromal
period of 3-5 days is followed by Frank clinical features
lasting for 1-3 weeks, and subsequently complete recovery
occurs after 2 months. The usual clinical features are as
under:
1.
During prodromal period (first 3-5 days), the symptoms
are mild such as malaise, myalgia, headache and fatigue.
2.
Frank clinical features (next 7-21 days) commonly are
fever, sore throat and bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy.
Less commonly, splenomegaly (50% patients), hepatomegaly
(10% cases), transient erythematous maculopapular eruption
on the trunk and extremities, and neurologic manifestations
are found. Pneumonia and cardiac involvement are
infrequent. One of the complications of IM is proneness for
splenic rupture due to splenitis.

352
SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
Laboratory Findings
The diagnosis of IM is made by characteristic haemato-
logic and serologic findings.
1. HAEMATOLOGIC FINDINGS. Major abnormalities
in blood are as under:
i) TLC: There is a moderate rise in total white cell count
(10,000-20,000/μl) during 2nd to 3rd week after infection.
ii) DLC: There is an absolute lymphocytosis. The lympho-
cytosis is due to rise in normal as well as atypical T
lymphocytes. There is relative neutropenia.
iii) Atypical T cells: Out of the total lymphocytes in the
peripheral blood, essential to the diagnosis of IM is the
presence of at least 10-12% atypical T cells (or mononucleosis
cells) (Fig. 14.9). The mononucleosis cells are variable in
appearance and are classed as Downey type I, II and III,
of which Downey type I are found most frequently. These
atypical T lymphocytes are usually of the size of large
lymphocytes (12-16 μm diameter). The nucleus, rather
than the usual round configuration, is oval, kidney-shaped
or slightly lobate due to indentation of nuclear membrane
and contains relatively fine chromatin without nucleoli,
suggesting an immature pattern but short of leukaemic
features. The cytoplasm is more abundant, basophilic and
finely granular and may contain vacuoles. The greatest
number of atypical lymphocytes is found between 7th to
10th day of the illness and these cells may persist in the
blood for up to 2 months.
iv) CD 4+ and CD8+ T cell counts. There is reversal of
CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio. There is marked decrease in
CD4+ T cells while there is substantial rise in CD8+ T cells.
v) Platelets. There is generally thrombocytopenia in the
first 4 weeks of illness.
2. SEROLOGIC DIAGNOSIS. The second characteristic
laboratory finding is the demonstration of antibodies in
the serum of infected patient. These are as under:
i) Test for heterophile antibodies. Heterophile antibody
test (Paul-Bunnell test) is used for making the diagnosis
of IM. In this test, patient’s serum is absorbed with guinea
pig kidney. Serum dilutions are prepared which are used
for agglutination of red cells of sheep, horse or cow and
are reported as heterophile titer of test serum. A high
serum titer of 40 or more times is diagnostic of acute IM
infection in symptomatic case in the first week.
Heterophile antibodies peak during the 3rd week in 80-
90% cases. The test remains positive for about 3 months
after the illness started.  Thus, the test has to be repeatedly
performed. Similar antibody is also produced in patients
suffering from serum sickness and has to be distinguished
by differential absorption studies. Heterophile antibodies
are not demonstrable in children under 5 years of age or
in quite elderly. Currently, more sensitive and rapid kit-
based test for heterophile antibodies, monospot, is also
available.
ii) EBV-specific antibody tests. Specific antibodies against
the viral capsid and nucleus of EBV can be demonstrated
in patients who are negative for heterophile antibody test:
a) Specific antibody against EBV capsid antigen show elevated
titers in over 90% cases during acute infection.  IgM class
antibody appears early and is thus most useful for
diagnosis of acute infection. IgG class antibody appears
later and persists throughout life; thus it does not have
diagnostic value but is instead used for assessing the past
exposure to EBV infection.
b) Antibodies against EBV nuclear antigen are detected 3 to
6 weeks after infection and, like IgG class antibodies,
persist throughout life.
c) Antibodies to early antigens may be elevated but are less
useful for making diagnosis of IM. However, titers of these
antibodies remain elevated for 3 to 6 months and their
levels are high in cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
African Burkitt’s lymphoma.
d) IgA antibodies to EBV antigen are seen in patients of
nasopharyngeal carcinoma or those who are at high risk
of developing this EBV-induced cancer.
iii) EBV antigen detection. Detection of EBV DNA or
proteins can be done in blood or CSF by PCR method.
3. LIVER FUNCTION TESTS. In addition, abnormalities
of the liver function test are found in about 90% of cases.
These include elevated serum levels of transaminases
(SGOT and SGPT), rise in serum alkaline phosphatase and
mild elevation of serum bilirubin.
LEUKAEMOID REACTIONS
Leukaemoid reaction is defined as a reactive excessive leuco-
cytosis in the peripheral blood resembling that of leukaemia
in a subject who does not have leukaemia. In spite of
confusing blood picture, the clinical features of leukaemia
such as splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and haemorrhages
are usually absent and the features of underlying disorder
causing the leukaemoid reaction are generally obvious.
Leukaemoid reaction may be myeloid or lymphoid; the
former is much more common.

infectious mononucleosis.

353
CHAPTER 14
Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues
Myeloid Leukaemoid Reaction
CAUSES. Majority of leukaemoid reactions involve the
granulocyte series. It may occur in association with a wide
variety of diseases. These are as under:
1.
Infections e.g. staphylococcal pneumonia, disseminated
tuberculosis, meningitis, diphtheria, sepsis, endocarditis,
plague, infected abortions etc.
2.
Intoxication e.g. eclampsia, mercury poisoning, severe
burns.
3.
Malignant diseases e.g. multiple myeloma, myelofibrosis,
Hodgkin’s disease, bone metastases.
4.
Severe haemorrhage and severe haemolysis.
LABORATORY FINDINGS. Myeloid leukaemoid reaction
is characterised by the following laboratory features:
1. Leucocytosis, usually moderate, not exceeding 100,000/
μl.
2. Proportion of immature cells mild to moderate,
comprised by metamyelocytes, myelocytes (5-15%), and
blasts fewer than 5% i.e. the blood picture simulates
somewhat with that of CML (Fig. 14.10, A).
3. Infective cases may show toxic granulation and Döhle
bodies in the cytoplasm of neutrophils.
4. Neutrophil (or Leucocyte) alkaline phosphatase (NAP or LAP)
score in the cytoplasm of mature neutrophils in leukaemoid
reaction is characteristically high and is very useful to
distinguish it from chronic myeloid leukaemia in doubtful
cases (Fig. 14.10, B).
5. Cytogenetic studies may be helpful in exceptional cases
which reveal negative Philadelphia chromosome in
myeloid leukaemoid reaction but positive in cases of CML.
6. Additional features include anaemia, normal-to-raised
platelet count, myeloid hyperplasia of the marrow and
absence of infiltration by immature cells in organs and
tissues.
Table 14.3 sums up the features to distinguish myeloid
leukaemoid reaction from chronic myeloid leukaemia.
Lymphoid Leukaemoid Reaction
CAUSES. Lymphoid leukaemoid reaction may be found in
the following conditions:
1.
Infections e.g. infectious mononucleosis, cytomegalovirus
infection, pertussis (whooping cough), chickenpox, measles,
infectious lymphocytosis, tuberculosis.
2.
Malignant diseases may rarely produce lymphoid
leukaemoid reaction.
LABORATORY FINDINGS. The blood picture is
characterised by the following findings:
1. Leucocytosis not exceeding 100,000/μl.
2. The differential white cell count reveals mostly mature
lymphocytes simulating the blood picture found in cases
of CLL.
HAEMATOLOGIC NEOPLASMS
(LEUKAEMIAS-LYMPHOMAS): GENERAL
CLASSIFICATION: CURRENT CONCEPTS
Neoplastic proliferations of white blood cells— leukaemias
and lymphomas, are the most important group of leucocyte
disorders.
Historically, leukaemias have been classified on the basis
of cell types predominantly involved into myeloid and
lymphoid, and on the basis of natural history of the disease,
into acute and chronic. Thus, the main types of leukaemias
have been: acute myeloblastic leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic
Figure 14.10

354
SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
leukaemia (AML and ALL), and chronic myeloid leukaemia and
chronic lymphocytic leukaemias (CML and CLL); besides there
are some other uncommon variants. In general, acute
leukaemias are characterised by predominance of
undifferentiated leucocyte precursors or leukaemic blasts and
have a rapidly downhill course. Chronic leukaemias, on the
other hand, have easily recognisable late precursor series of
leucocytes circulating in large number as the predominant
leukaemic cell type and the patients tend to have more
indolent behaviour. The incidence of both acute and chronic
leukaemias is higher in men than in women. ALL is primarily
a disease of children and young adults, whereas AML occurs
at all ages. CLL tends to occur in the elderly, while CML is
found in middle age.
Similary, over the years, lymphomas which are malignant
tumours of lymphoreticular tissues have been categorised
into two distinct clinicopathologic groups: Hodgkin’s
lymphoma or Hodgkin’s disease (HD) characterised by
pathognomonic presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, and a
heterogenous group of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL).
In the last 50 years, several classification systems have
been proposed for leukaemias and lymphomas—clinicians
favouring an approach based on clinical findings while
pathologists have been interested in classifying them on
morphologic features. More recent classification schemes
have been based on cytochemistry, immunophenotyping,
cytogenetics and molecular markers which have become
available to pathologists and haematologists. The most recent
classification scheme proposed by the World Health
Organisation (WHO) in 2002  combines all tumours of
haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues together. The basis of
the WHO classification is the cell type of the neoplasm as
identified by combined approach of clinical features and
morphologic, cytogenetic and molecular characteristics,
rather than location of the neoplasm (whether in blood or in
tissues) because of the fact that haematopoietic cells are
present in circulation as well as in tissues in general, and
lymphoreticular tissues in particular.
Currently, neoplasms of haematopoietic and lymphoid
tissues are considered as a unified group and are divided
into 3 broad categories:
I.
Myeloid neoplasms: This group includes neoplasms of
myeloid cell lineage and therefore includes neoplastic
proliferations of red blood cells, platelets, granulocytes and
monocytes. There are 5 categories under myeloid series of
neoplasms: myeloproliferative disorders, myeloprolife-
rative/myelodysplastic diseases, myelodysplastic
syndromes (MDS), and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML),
acute biphenotypic leukaemias.
II. Lymphoid neoplasms: Neoplasms of lymphoid lineage
include leukaemias and lymphomas of B, T or NK cell origin.
This group thus includes B cell neoplasms (including plasma
cell disorders), T cell neoplasms, NK cell neoplasms and
Hodgkin’s disease.
III. Histiocytic neoplasms: This group is of interest mainly
due to neoplastic proliferations of histiocytes in Langerhans
cell histiocytisis.
Besides the WHO classification, the FAB (French-
American-British) Cooperative Group classification of
lymphomas and leukaemias based on morphology and
cytochemistry is also widely used.
These as well as other classification schemes have been
tabulated and discussed later under separate headings of
myeloid and lymphoid malignancies.
ETIOLOGY
Like in most cancers, the exact etiology of leukaemias and
lymphomas is not known. However, a number of factors have
been implicated:
1.
HEREDITY. There is evidence to suggest that there is
role of family history, occurrence in identical twins and
predisposition of these malignancies in certain genetic
syndromes:

CHAPTER 14
Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues
i) Identical twins: There is high concordance rate among
identical twins if acute leukaemia develops in the first year
of life. Hodgkin’s disease is 99 times more common in
identical twin of an affected case compared with general
population, implicating genetic origin strongly.
ii) Family history. Families with excessive incidence of
leukaemia have been identified.
iii) Genetic disease association. Acute leukaemia occurs with
increased frequency with a variety of congenital disorders
such as Down’s, Bloom’s, Klinefelter’s and Wiskott-Aldrich’s
syndromes, Fanconi’s anaemia and ataxia telangiectasia.
Hodgkin’s disease has familial incidence and with certain
HLA type.
2.
INFECTIONS. There is evidence to suggest that certain
infections, particularly viruses, are involved in development
of lymphomas and leukaemias (Chapter 8):
i)
Human T cell leukaemia-lymphoma virus I (HTLV-I)
implicated in etiology of adult T cell leukaemia-lymphoma
(ATLL).
ii) HTLV II for T cell variant of hairy cell leukaemia.
iii) Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) implicated in the etiology of
Hodgkin’s disease (mixed cellularity type and nodular
sclerosis type), endemic variety of Burkitt’s lymphoma, post-
transplant lymphoma,
iv) HIV in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt’s
lymphoma.
v) Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.
vi) Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) in primary effusion
lymphoma.
vii) Helicobacter pylori  bacterial infection of gastric mucosa
in MALT lymphoma of the stomach.
3.
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. Certain environmental
factors are known to play a role in the etiology of leukaemias
and lymphomas:
i)
Ionising radiation. Damage due to radiation exposure
has been linked to development of leukaemias and
lymphomas.  Individuals exposed to occupational radiation
exposure, patients receiving radiation therapy, and Japanese
survivors of the atomic bomb explosions have been found to
be at higher risk of developing haematopoietic malignancies,
particularly prone to development of CML, AML and ALL
but not to CLL or hairy cell leukaemia.
ii) Chemical carcinogens. Benzene, tobacco smoking,
alcohol, use of certain hair dyes and exposure to agriculture
chemicals are associated with increased risk of development
of haematopoietic malignancies.
iii) Certain drugs. Long-term exposure to certain drugs such
as phenytoin, alkylating agents and other chemotherapeutic
agents is associated with increased incidence of leukaemias
and lymphomas. Patients treated for Hodgkin’s disease can
develop NHL.
4. ASSOCIATION WITH DISEASES OF IMMUNITY.
Since lymphoid cells are the immune cells of the body,
diseases with derangements of the immune system have
higher incidence of haematopoietic malignancies:
i) Immunodeficiency diseases. Various inherited and
acquired immunodeficiency diseases including AIDS and
iatrogenic immunosuppression induced by chemotherapy or
radiation, are associated with subsequent development of
lymphomatous transformation.
ii) Autoimmune disease association. A few autoimmune
diseases such as Sjögren’s syndrome, nontropical sprue,
rheumatoid arthritis and SLE are associated with higher
incidence of NHL.
PATHOGENESIS
It needs to be emphasised that since haematopoietic cells
have a rapid turnover, they are more vulnerable to
chromosomal damages and cytogenetic changes under
influence of various etiologic factors listed above.
1. Genetic damage to single clone of target cells. Leukaemias
and lymphomas arise following malignant transformation
of a single clone of cells belonging to myeloid or lymphoid
series, followed by proliferation of the transformed clone.
Basic mechanism of malignant transformation is genetic
damage to the DNA of the target white cells followed by
proliferation, disrupting normal growth and differentiation.
The heritable genetic damage may be induced by various
etiologic agents listed above (e.g. RNA viruses HTLV-I, EBV
etc) and causes insertional mutagenesis for which oncogenes
may play a role (Chapter 8). The evolution of leukaemia is
multi-step process, and in many cases, acute leukaemia may
develop after a pre-existing myelodysplastic or
myeloproliferative disorder.
2.
Chromosomal translocations. A number of cytogenetic
abnormalities have been detected in cases of leukaemias-
lymphomas, most consistent of which are chromosomal
translocations. In NHL, translocation involving antigen
receptor genes, immunoglobulin genes, or overexpression
of BCL-2 protein may be seen. The most consistent
chromosomal abnormality in various forms of acute and
chronic leukaemias is Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome seen
in 70-90% cases with CML, involving reciprocal translocation
of parts of long arm of chromosome 22 to the long arm of
chromosome 9 i.e. t(9;22) (Fig. 14.11).
3.
Maturation defect. In acute leukaemia, the single most
prominent characteristic of the leukaemic cells is a defect in
maturation beyond the myeloblast or promyelocyte level in
AML, and the lymphoblast level in ALL. It needs to be
emphasised that it is the maturation defect in leukaemic
blasts rather than rapid proliferation of leukaemic cells
responsible for causing acute leukaemia. In fact, the
generation time of leukaemic blasts is somewhat prolonged
rather than shortened.
4.
Myelosuppression. As the leukaemic cells accumulate
in the bone marrow, there is suppression of normal
haematopoietic stem cells, partly by physically replacing the
normal marrow precursors, and partly by inhibiting normal
haematopoiesis via cell-mediated or humoral mechanisms.
This is based on the observation that some patients with acute
leukaemia have a hypocellular marrow indicating that

356
SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
marrow failure is not due to overcrowding by leukaemic cells
alone. Nevertheless, some normal haematopoietic stem cells
do remain in the marrow which are capable of proliferating
and restoring normal haematopoiesis after effective anti-
leukaemic treatment.
5. Organ infiltration. The leukaemic cells proliferate
primarily in the bone marrow, circulate in the blood and
infiltrate into other tissues such as lymph nodes, liver, spleen,
skin, viscera and the central nervous system.
6.
Cytokines. Presence of reactive inflammatory cells in the
Hodgkin’s disease is due to secretion of cytokines from the
Reed Sternberg cells e.g. IL-5 (growth factor for eosinophils),
IL-13 (for autocrine stimulation of RS cells) and transforming
growth factor-β (for fibrogenesis).
MYELOID NEOPLASMS
Based on the cell line of differentiation of the pluripotent
stem cell, the WHO classification (2002) recognises all
haematopoieitc neoplasms into 2 groups: myeloid and
lymphoid neoplasms. Since myeloid trilineage stem cells
further differentiate into 3 series of progenitor cells: erythroid,
granulocyte-monocyte, and megakaryocytic series, therefore
all examples of myeloid neoplasms fall into these three
categories of cell-lines.  Based on this concept, the WHO
classification of myeloid neoplasms includes following 5
groups (Fig. 14.12):
I.
Myeloproliferative diseases
II. Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases
III. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
IV. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)
V. Acute biphenotypic leukaemia
Each of these groups is subclassifed into further types as
shown in Table 14.4. Important examples within each group
are discussed below.
MYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISEASES
The myeloproliferative disorders are a group of neoplastic
proliferation of multipotent haematopoietic stem cells.
Besides their common stem cell origin, these disorders are
closely related, occasionally leading to evolution of one entity
into another during the course of the disease.
Figure 14.11
The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. There is reciprocal
translocation of the part of the long arms of chromosome 22 to the long
arms of chromosome 9 written as t(9;22).

CHAPTER 14
Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues
The WHO classification of myeloproliferative disorders
includes 7 types as shown in Table 14.4. Classic and common
examples are chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML),
polycythaemia vera (PV), and essential thrombocytosis (ET),
each one representing corresponding excess of granulocytes,
red blood cells, and platelets, respectively. The group as a
whole has slow and insidious onset of clinical features and
indolent clinical behaviour.
CHRONIC MYELOID LEUKAEMIA (CML)
Definition and Pathophysiology
By WHO definition, CML is established by identification of
the clone of haematopoietic stem cell that possesses the
reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22,
forming Philadelphia chromosome. The t(9;22)  involves
fusion of BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on
chromosome 22q11 with ABL (named after Abelson murine
leukaemia virus) gene located on chromosome 9q34. The
fusion product so formed is termed “Ph chromosome t(9;22)
(q34;11), BCR/ABL” which should be positive for making
the diagnosis of CML. This identification may be done by
microsatellite PCR or by FISH. The underlying patho-
physiologic mechanism of human CML is based on the
observation that BCR/ABL fusion product proteins are
capable of transforming haematopoietic progenitor cells in
vitro and form malignant clone. BCR/ABL fusion product
brings about following functional changes:
i) ABL protein is activated to function as a tyrosine kinase
enzyme that in turn activates other kinases which inhibits
apoptosis.
ii) Ability of ABL to act as DNA-binding protein is altered.
iii) Binding of ABL to actin microfilaments of the cytoskeleton
is increased.
Exact mechanism of progression of CML to the blastic
phase is unclear but following mechanisms may be involved:
i)
Structural alterations in tumour suppressor p53 gene.
ii) Structural alterations in tumour suppressor Rb gene.
iii) Alterations in RAS oncogene.
iv) Alterations in MYC oncogene.
v) Release of cytokine IL-1β.
vi) Functional inactivation of tumour suppressor protein,
phosphatase A2.
Clinical Features
Chronic myeloid (myelogenous, granulocytic) leukaemia
comprises about 20% of all leukaemias and its peak incidence
is seen in 3rd and 4th decades of life. A distinctive variant of
CML seen in children is called juvenile CML. Both sexes are
affected equally. The onset of CML is generally insidious.
Some of the common presenting manifestations are as under:
1.
Features of anaemia such as weakness, pallor, dyspnoea
and tachycardia.
2.
Symptoms due to hypermetabolism such as weight loss,
lassitude, anorexia, night sweats.
3.
Splenomegaly is almost always present and is frequently
massive. In some patients, it may be associated with acute
pain due to splenic infarction.
4.
Bleeding tendencies such as easy bruising, epistaxis,
menorrhagia and haematomas may occur.
5.
Less common features include gout, visual disturbance,
neurologic manifestations and priapism.
6.
Juvenile CML is more often associated with lymph node
enlargement than splenomegaly. Other features are frequent
infections, haemorrhagic manifestations and facial rash.
Laboratory Findings
The diagnosis of CML is generally possible on blood
picture alone. However, bone marrow, cytochemical stains
and other investigations are of help.
I. BLOOD PICTURE. The typical blood picture in a case
of CML at the time of presentation shows the following

V.  ACUTE BIPHENOTYPIC LEUKAEMIA

358
SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
1. Anaemia. Anaemia is usually of moderate degree and
is normocytic normochromic in type. Occasional
normoblasts may be present.
2. White blood cells. Characteristically, there is marked
leucocytosis (approximately 200,000/μl or more at the
time of presentation). The natural history of CML consists
of 3 phases—chronic, accelerated, and blastic.
Chronic phase of CML begins as a myeloproliferative
disorder and consists of excessive proliferation of myeloid
cells of intermediate grade (i.e. myelocytes and
metamyelocytes) and mature segmented neutrophils.
Myeloblasts usually do not exceed 10% of cells in the
peripheral blood and bone marrow. An increase in the
proportion of basophils up to 10% is a characteristic
feature of CML. A rising basophilia is indicative of
impending blastic transformation. An accelerated phase of
CML is also described in which there is progressively
rising leucocytosis associated with thrombocytosis or
thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly.
Accelerated phase  is defined as increasing degree of
anaemia, blast count in blood or marrow between 10-20%,
marrow basophils 20% or more, and platelet count falling
below 1,00,000/μl.
  Blastic phase or blast crisis in CML fulfills the definition
of acute leukaemia in having blood or marrow blasts
>20%. These blast cells may be myeloid, lymphoid,
erythroid or undifferentiated and are established by
morphology, cytochemistry, or immunophenotyping.
Myeloid blast crisis in CML is more common and
resembles AML. However, unlike AML, Auer rods are
not seen in myeloblasts of CML in blast crisis.
3.  Platelets. Platelet count may be normal but is raised in
about half the cases.
II.  BONE MARROW EXAMINATION. Examination of
marrow aspiration yields the following results:
1. Cellularity. Generally, there is hypercellularity with
total or partial replacement of fat spaces by proliferating
myeloid cells.
2. Myeloid cells. The myeloid cells predominate in the
bone marrow with increased myeloid-erythroid ratio. The
differential counts of myeloid cells in the marrow show
similar findings as seen in the peripheral blood with
predominance of myelocytes.
3. Erythropoiesis. Erythropoiesis is normoblastic but there
is reduction in erythropoietic cells.
4. Megakaryocytes. Megakaryocytes are conspicuous but
are usually smaller in size than normal.
5. Cytogenetics. Cytogenetic studies on blood and bone
marrow cells show the characteristic chromosomal
abnormality called Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome seen
in 90-95% cases of CML. Ph chromosome is formed by
reciprocal balanced translocation between part of long arm
of chromosome 22 and part of long arm of chromosome
9{(t(9;22) (q34;11)} forming product of fusion gene, BCR/
ABL (see Fig. 14.11).
III. CYTOCHEMISTRY. The only significant finding on
cytochemical stains is reduced scores of neutrophil alkaline
phosphatase (NAP) which helps to distinguish CML from
myeloid leukaemoid reaction in which case NAP scores
are elevated (see Fig. 14.10,B, and Table 14.3). However,
NAP scores in CML return to normal with successful
therapy, corticosteroid administration and in infections.
IV. OTHER INVESTIGATIONS. A few other accompa-
nying findings are seen in CML:
1. Elevated serum B12 and vitamin B12 binding capacity.
2. Elevated serum uric acid (hyperuricaemia).
Treatment and Complications
Insight into molecular mechanism of CML has brought about
major changes in its therapy. The approach of modern
therapy in CML is targetted at removal of all malignant clones
of cells bearing BCR/ABL fusion protein, so that patient
reverts back to prolonged non-clonal haematopoiesis i.e.
molecular remission from disease. This is achievable by the
following approaches:
Figure 14.13
PBF findings in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML).

359
CHAPTER 14
Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues
1. Imatinib oral therapy: The basic principle underlying
imatinib oral treatment is to competitively inhibit ATP
binding site of the ABL kinase, which in turn, inhibits signal
transduction BCR/ABL fusion protein. Imatinib induces
apoptosis in BCR/ABL-positive cells and thus eliminates
them. Imatinib is found more effective in newly diagnosed
cases of CML. Complete haematologic remission is achieved
for 18 months in 97% cases treated with imatinib.
2. Allogenic bone marrow (stem cell) transplantation.
Although this treatment modality offers proven cure, it is
complicated with mortality due to procedure and
development of post-transplant graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD) and, therefore, post-transplant immunosuppressive
treatment has to be continued.
3. Interferon-α. Prior to imatinib and allogenic trans-
plantation, chronic phase of CML used to be treated with
interferon-α was the drug of choice.
4. Chemotherapy. Chemotherapeutic agents are used in
treatment of CML for lowering the total population of WBCs.
These include use of busulfan, cyclophosphamide
(melphalan) and hydroxyurea.
5. Others. Besides above, other forms of treatment include
splenic irradiation, splenectomy and leucopheresis.
The most common cause of death (in 80% cases) in CML
is disease acceleration and blastic transformation.
POLYCYTHAEMIA VERA
Definition and Pathophysiology
Polycythaemia vera (PV) is a clonal disorder characterised
by increased production of all myeloid elements resulting in
pancytosis (i.e increased red cells, granulocytes, platelets) in
the absence of any recognisable cause. The term
‘polycythaemia vera’ or ‘polycythaemia rubra vera’ is used
for primary or idiopathic polycythaemia only and is the most
common of all the myeloproliferative disorders. Secondary
polycythaemia or erythrocytosis, on the other hand, may occur
secondary to several causes e.g. high altitude, cardiovascular
disease, pulmonary disease with alveolar hypoventilation,
heavy smoking, inappropriate increase in erythropoietin
(renal cell carcinoma, hydronephrosis, hepatocellular carci-
noma, cerebellar haemangioblastoma, massive uterine
leiomyoma); sometimes relative or spurious polycythaemia
may result from plasma loss such as in burns and in
dehydration from vomiting or water deprivation. None of
the secondary causes of polycythaemia is associated with
splenic enlargement or increased leucocytes and platelets
which are typical of PV.
The exact etiology of PV is not known but about a third
of cases show inconsistent and varied chromosomal
abnormalities such as 20q, trisomy 8 and 9p. Major
pathogenetic mechanism is a tyrosine kinase JAK2 mutation
which removes the autoinhibitory control and activates the
kinases.
Clinical Features
PV is a disease of late middle life and is slightly more
common in males. The disease generally runs a chronic but
slowly progressive course. Clinical features are the result of
hyperviscosity, hypervolaemia, hypermetabolism and
decreased cerebral perfusion. These are as under:
1.
Headache, vertigo, tinnitus, visual alterations syncope
or even coma.
2.
Increased risk of thrombosis due to accelerated athero-
sclerosis.
3.
Increased risk of haemorrhages due to increased blood
volume and intrinsic platelet dysfunction e.g. epistaxis,
peptic ulcer disease.
4.
Splenomegaly producing abdominal fullness.
5.
Pruritus, especially after a bath.
6.
Increased risk of urate stones and gout due to
hyperuricaemia.
Laboratory Findings
PV is diagnosed by the following haematologic findings:
1. Raised haemoglobin concentration (above 17.5 g/dl in
males and 15.5 g/dl in females).
2. Erythrocytosis (above 6 million/μl in males and
5.5 million/μl in females).
3. Haematocrit (PCV) above 55% in males and above 47%
in females.
4. Mild to moderate leucocytosis (15,000-25,000/μl) with
basophilia and raised neutrophil alkaline phosphatase
scores.
5. Thrombocytosis with defective platelet function.
6. Bone marrow examination reveals erythroid hyper-
plasia or panhyperplasia.
7. Cytogenetic abnormalities such as 20q,  trisomy 8 and
9p are found in 30% cases of PV.
 8. In PV, unlike secondary polycythaemia, erythropoietin
levels in serum and urine are reduced.
Treatment and Complications
Since PV runs an indolent course, therapy is aimed at
maintaining normal blood counts and relieve the patient of
symptoms.
1. Phlebotomy (venesection) by blood letting is done at regular
interval to reduce total blood cell mass and to induce a state
of iron deficiency.
2. Anticoagulant therapy is adminstered in case thrombosis
has occurred.
3. Chemotherapy may be indicated to induce myelosuppresion.
4. Hyperuricaemia is treated with uricosuric drugs.
5. Interferon-α is associated with good results because it
reduces JAK2 expression in these patients which is the
underlying cytogenetic abnormality.
Patients receiving phlebotomy alone may survive for 10-
12 years. About 25% patients progress to myelofibrosis. A
small proportion of patients develop secondary haematologic
malignancies such as AML, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and
multiple myeloma. Major complication and cause of death
in PV is vascular thrombosis.

SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
ESSENTIAL THROMBOCYTHAEMIA
Definition and Pathophysiology
Essential thrombocythaemia (ET), also termed essential
thrombocytosis or primary (idiopathic) thrombocythaemia
is a clonal disorder characterised by markedly elevated
platelet count in the absence of any recognisable stimulus.
Secondary or reactive thrombocytosis, on the other hand, occurs
in response to known stimuli such as: chronic infection,
haemorrhage, postoperative state, chronic iron deficiency,
malignancy, rheumatoid arthritis and postsplenectomy.
ET is an uncommon disorder and represents an
overproduction of platelets from megakaryocyte colonies
without any added stimulus but no clonal marker is available
to distinguish primary from secondary thrombocytosis.
Though an elevated platelet count is the dominant feature,
other cell lines may also be involved in the expansion of
neoplastic clone.
The underlying pathophysiologic mechanism in ET is the
absence of control by thrombopoietin that regulates
endomitosis in the megakaryocytes to produce platelets. This
results in uncontrolled proliferation of not only mega-
karyocytes but also the platelets. There is probably role of
heredity in ET since families with ET have been reported.
Clinical Features
The condition has an insidious onset and is more frequent in
older people. Haemorrhagic and thrombotic events are
common. These include the following:
1.
Arterial or venous thrombosis.
2.
Easy bruisability following minor trauma.
3.
Spontaneous bleeding.
4.
Transient ischaemic attack or frank stroke due to platelet
aggregation in microvasculature of the CNS.
Laboratory Findings
The prominent laboratory features pertain to platelets.
These include the following:
1. Sustained elevation in platelet count (above 400,000 μl).
2. Blood film shows many large platelets, megakaryocyte
fragments and hypogranular forms.
3. Consistently abnormal platelet functions, especially
abnormality in platelet aggregation.
4. Bone marrow examination reveals a large number of
hyperdiploid megakaryocytes and variable amount of
increased fibrosis.
Treatment and Complications
ET runs a benign course and may not require any therapy.
Treatment is given only if platelet count is higher than one
million. Complications of ET are occurrence of acquired von
Willebrand’s disease and bleeding but incidence of
thrombosis is not higher than matched controls.
CHRONIC IDIOPATHIC MYELOFIBROSIS
Definition and Pathophysiology
Chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF), also called agnogenic
(of unknown origin) myeloid metaplasia, primary
myelofibrosis and myelosclerosis, is a clonal disorder
characterised by proliferation of neoplastic stem cells at
multiple sites outside the bone marrow (i.e. extramedullary
haematopoiesis), especially in the liver and spleen, without
an underlying etiology. Secondary myelofibrosis, on the other
hand, develops in association with certain well-defined
marrow disorders, or it is the result of toxic action of chemical
agents or irradiation.
The exact etiology is not known. Several chromosomal
abnormalities have been reported but without a specific
cytogenetic abnormality. Fibrosis in the bone marrow is due
to overproduction of transforming growth factor-β,
osteosclerosis of the bone is related to osteonectin and marrow
angiogenesis is due to increased production of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
Clinical Features
The disease begins in the late middle life and is gradual in
onset. Both sexes are affected equally. The symptomatology
includes the following:
1.
Anaemia with constitutional symptoms such as fatigue,
weakness and anorexia.
2.
Massive splenomegaly producing abdominal discomfort,
pain and dyspnoea.
3.
Hepatomegaly is present in half the cases.
4.
Petechial and other bleeding problems are found in about
20% cases.
5.
Less common findings are lymphadenopathy, jaundice,
ascites, bone pain and hyperuricaemia.
Laboratory Findings
1. Mild anaemia is usual except in cases where features of
polycythaemia vera are coexistent.
2. Leucocytosis at the time of presentation but later there
may be leucopenia.
3. Thrombocytosis initially but advanced cases show
thrombocytopenia.
4. Peripheral blood smear shows bizarre red cell shapes, tear
drop poikilocytes, basophilic stippling, nucleated red cells,
immature leucocytes (i.e. leucoerythroblastic reaction),
basophilia and giant platelet forms.
5. Bone marrow aspiration is generally unsuccessful and
yields ‘dry tap’. Examination of trephine biopsy shows
focal areas of hypercellularity and increased reticulin
network and variable amount of collagen in which clusters
of megakaryocytes are seen well preserved.
6. Extramedullary haematopoiesis can be documented by
liver biopsy or splenic aspiration.
Treatment and Complications
Chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis does not require any
specific therapy. Anaemia and ineffective erythropoiesis

361
CHAPTER 14
Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues
cannot be readily treated and do not respond to erythro-
poietin, androgens. Splenectomy may be necessary in some
cases. In general, chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis has poorer
outcome compared with PV and ET.
MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES
Definition and Classification
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous
group of haematopoietic clonal stem cell disorders having
abnormal development of different marrow elements (i.e.
dysmyelopoiesis), usually characterised by cytopenias,
associated with cellular marrow and ineffective blood cell
formation. These conditions are, therefore, also termed as
preleukaemic syndromes or dysmyelopoietic syndromes.
There have been two main classification schemes for
MDS:
FAB CLASSIFICATION OF MDS (1983): FAB (French-
American-British) Cooperative Group classified MDS into
the following 5 groups:
1.
Refractory anaemia (RA).
2.
Refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblasts (primary
acquired sideroblastic anaemia) (RARS).
3.
Refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB).
4.
Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML).
5.
Refractory anaemia with excess of blasts in
transformation (RAEB-t).
As per FAB classification, the marrow may contain <30%
myeloblasts in MDS and this was considered as the dividing
line for distinguishing cases of AML (blasts >30%) from MDS.
WHO CLASSIFICATION OF MDS (2002): According to the
WHO classification, patients with blast count of 20-30% and
labelled as RAEB-t (group 5 above) in FAB classification have
prognosis similar to patients with blast count above 30% (i.e.
AML cases). Thus, as per WHO classification, marrow blast
count for making the diagnosis of AML has been revised
and brought down to 20%. Thus, patients with FAB category
of RAEB-t (i.e. group 5 above) are currently considered and
treated as cases of AML and therefore the term RAEB-t stands
excluded from WHO MDS classification. Besides, the WHO
classification excludes CMML (FAB category 4) from MDS
and puts in the hybrid category of myelodysplastic/
myeloproliferative disorder since CMML behaves like a
myeloproliferative disorder; moreover refractory anaemia in
it is not due to erythroid lineage which was considered as an
inclusion criteria for MDS. Thus, the WHO classification of
MDS consists of following 8 categories:
1. Refractory anaemia (RA): Same as FAB type 1 MDS.
Incidence 5-10%; characterised by anaemia without any blasts
in blood; marrow may show <5% blasts.
2. Refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblasts  (RARS):
Same as FAB type 2 MDS. Incidence 10-12%; all findings in
blood and marrow similar to RA above but in addition
marrow may show >15% ringed sideroblasts.
3. Refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia
(RCMD): New entity. Incidence 24%; blood shows cytopenia
of 2 or 3 cell lineage and monocytosis but no blasts; marrow
shows <5% blasts.
4. RCMD with ringed sideroblasts (RCMD-RS): New entity.
Incidence 15%; all blood and marrow findings similar to
RCMD plus in addition >15% ringed sideroblasts in marrow.
5. Refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB-1): RAEB
of FAB category 3 divided into 2 subtypes with combined
incidence of 40%. RAEB –1 has blood cytopenia with <5%
blasts and monocytosis; marrow blast count 5-9%.
6. RAEB-2: Findings of blood and marrow similar to
RAEB-1 but marrow blast count is 10-19%.
7. Myelodysplastic syndrome unclassified (MDS-U): New
entity in MDS. Blood cytopenia without any blasts; marrow
shows dysplasia of myeloid and thrombocytic cell lineage
and marrow blast count <5%.
8. MDS with isolated del (5q): New entity in MDS. Anaemia
in blood and blasts <5%; marrow blasts <5%, normal or
increased megakaryocytes and characteristic isolated
deletion of 5q.
Pathophysiology
Primary MDS is idiopathic but factors implicated in etiology
are radiation exposure and benzene carcinogen. Secondary
(therapy-related) MDS may occur following earlier anti-
cancer treatment, aplastic anaemia treated with immuno-
suppressive therapy and in Fanconi’s anaemia.  Several
cytogenetic abnormalities are seen in about 50% of MDS
which include trisomy, translocations and deletions. Cases
evolving into leukaemia more often have aneuploidy. At
molecular level, mutations are seen in N-RAS oncogene and
p53 anti-oncogene, which together with suppressed
immunity, accelerate apoptosis in the bone marrow.
Mutations in the mitochondrial genes probably account for
occurrence of sideroblastic anaemia in MDS and conse-
quently disordered iron metabolism and ineffective
erythropoiesis.
Clinical Features
In general, MDS is found more frequently in older people
past 6th decade of life, with slight male preponderance.
Therapy-related MDS is generally not age-related and may
occur about a decade after anti-cancer therapy. Clinical
features are quite non-specific and MDS may be discovered
during routine CBC examination done for some other cause.
At presentation the patient may have following features:
1.
Anaemia appreciated by pallor, fatigue and weakness.
2.
Fever.
3.
Weight loss.
4.
Sweet syndrome having neutrophilic dermatosis seen in
some cases.
5.
Splenomegaly seen in 20% cases of MDS.
Laboratory Findings
Various combinations of features are seen in different
types of MDS. In general, laboratory findings are as under:
BLOOD FINDINGS. There is cytopenia affecting two
(bi-)  or all the three blood cell lines (pancytopenia):

1. Anaemia: Generally macrocytic or dimorphic.
2. TLC: Usually normal; cases of CMML may have high
TLC but these cases in WHO classification of myeloid
neoplasms have been put in a separate group of myelo-
dysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases and not in MDS.
3. DLC: Neutrophils are hyposegmented and hypo-
granulated. Myeloblasts may be seen in PBF and their
number correlates with marrow blasts count.
4. Platelets: Thrombocytopenia with large agranular
platelets.
BONE MARROW FINDINGS. There is constellation of
findings in the marrow as under:
1. Cellularity: Normal to hypercellular to hypocellular.
2. Erythroid series: Dyserythropoiesis as seen by
abnormally appearing nuclei and ring sideroblasts.
Megaloblasts may be seen.
3. Myeloid series: Hypogranular and hyposegmented
myeloid precursor cells. Myeloblasts increased depending
upon the type of MDS.
4. Megakaryocyte series: Reduced in number and having
abnormal nuclei.
Treatment and Complications
MDS is difficult to treat and may not respond to cytotoxic
chemotherapy. Stem cell transplantation offers cure and
longer survival. Survival rates vary depending upon the
type of MDS: cases of refractory anaemia with or without
sideroblasts (RA and RARS) and 5q syndrome survive for
years, while cases of refractory anaemia with excess blasts
(RAEB-1 and 2) have poor survival for a few months only.
Patients generally either succumb to infections or develop
into acute myeloid leukaemia.
ACUTE MYELOID LEUKAEMIA
Definition and Pathophysiology
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease
characterised by infiltration of malignant myeloid cells into
the blood, bone marrow and other tissues. AML is mainly a
disease of adults (median age 50 years), while children and
older individuals may also develop it.
AML develops due to inhibition of maturation of myeloid
stem cells due to mutations. These mutations may be induced
by several etiologic factors—heredity, radiation, chemical
carcinogens (tobacco smoking, rubber, plastic, paint,
insecticides etc) and long-term use of anti-cancer drugs but
viruses do not appear to have role in the etiology of AML.
The defect induced by mutations causes accumulation of
precursor myeloid cells of the stage at which the myeloid
maturation and differentiation is blocked. A few important
examples of chromosomal mutations in AML are
translocations {t(8;21)(q22q22) and t(15;17)(q22;q12)}  and
inversions { inv(16)(p13;q22)}.
Classification
Currently, two main classification schemes for AML are
followed:
FAB CLASSIFICATION. According to revised FAB
clasification system, a leukaemia is acute if the bone marrow
consists of more than 30% blasts. Based on morphology and
cytochemistry, FAB classification divides AML into 8
subtypes (M0 to M7)  (Table 14.5).
WHO CLASSIFICATION (2002). WHO classification for
AML differs from revised FAB classification in the following
2 ways:
1.
It places limited reliance on cytochemistry for making
the diagnosis of subtype of AML but instead takes into

consideration clinical, cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities
in different types. These features can be studied by
multiparametric flow cytometry.
2.
WHO classification for AML has revised and lowered the
cut off percentage of marrow blasts to 20% from 30% in the
FAB classification for making the diagnosis of AML. WHO
classifcation of AML is included in Table 14.4.
Both FAB as well as WHO classification schemes for AML
are followed in different settings depending upon the
laboratory facilities available in various centres. Moreover,
most of the current clinical and laboratory data are based on
FAB grouping and hence detailed morphologic and
cytochemical features of various AML groups are given in
Table 14.5.
Clinical Features
AML and ALL share many clinical features and the two are
difficult to distinguish on clinical features alone. In approxi-
mately 25% of patients with AML, a preleukaemic syndrome
with anaemia and other cytopenias may be present for a few
months to years prior to the development of overt leukaemia.
Clinical manifestations of AML are divided into 2 groups:
those due to bone marrow failure, and those due to organ
infiltration.
I.
DUE TO BONE MARROW FAILURE. These are as
under:
1.
Anaemia producing pallor, lethargy, dyspnoea.
2.
Bleeding manifestations due to thrombocytopenia causing
spontaneous bruises, petechiae, bleeding from gums and
other bleeding tendencies.
3.
Infections are quite common and include those of mouth,
throat, skin, respiratory, perianal and other sites.
4.
Fever is generally attributed to infections in acute leukae-
mia but sometimes no obvious source of infection can be
found and may occur in the absence of infection.
II. DUE TO ORGAN INFILTRATION. The clinical
manifestations of AML are more often due to replacement
of the marrow and other tissues by leukaemic cells. These
features are as under:
1.
Pain and tenderness of bones (e.g. sternal tenderness) are
due to bone infarcts or subperiosteal infiltrates by leukaemic
cells.
2.
Lymphadenopathy and enlargement of the tonsils may
occur.
3.
Splenomegaly of moderate grade may occur. Splenic
infarction, subcapsular haemorrhages, and rarely, splenic
rupture may occur.
4.
Hepatomegaly is frequently present due to leukaemic
infiltration but the infiltrates usually do not interfere with
the function of the liver.
5.
Leukaemic infiltration of the kidney may be present and
ordinarily does not interfere with its function unless
secondary complications such as haemorrhage or blockage
of ureter supervene.
6.
Gum hypertrophy due to leukaemic infiltration of the
gingivae is a frequent finding in myelomonocytic (M4) and
monocytic (M5) leukaemias.
7.
Chloroma or granulocytic sarcoma is a localised tumour-
forming mass occurring in the skin or orbit due to local
infiltration of the tissues by leukaemic cells. The tumour is
greenish in appearance due to the presence of
myeloperoxidase.
8.
Meningeal involvement manifested by raised intracranial
pressure, headache, nausea and vomiting, blurring of vision
and diplopia are seen more frequently in ALL during
haematologic remission. Sudden death from massive
intracranial haemorrhage as a result of leucostasis may occur.
9.
Other organ infiltrations include testicular swelling and
mediastinal compression.
Laboratory Findings
The diagnosis of AML is made by a combination of routine
blood picture and bone marrow examination, coupled
with cytochemical stains and other special laboratory
investigations.
I. BLOOD PICTURE. Findings of routine haematologic
investigations are as under (Fig. 14.14):
1. Anaemia. Anaemia is almost always present in AML.
It is generally severe, progressive and normochromic. A
moderate reticulocytosis up to 5% and a few nucleated
red cells may be present.
2. Thrombocytopenia. The platelet count is usually mode-
rately to severely reduced (below 50,000/μl) but
occasionally it may be normal. Bleeding tendencies in
AML are usually correlated with the level of
thrombocytopenia but most serious spontaneous
haemorrhagic episodes develop in patients with fewer
than 20,000/μl platelets. Acute promyelocytic leukaemia
(M3) may be associated with a serious coagulation
abnormality, disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC).
3. White blood cells. The total WBC count ranges from
subnormal-to-markedly elevated values. In 25% of
patients, the total WBC count at presentation is reduced
to 1,000-4,000 /μl. More often, however, there is progres-
sive rise in white cell count which may exceed 100,000/μl
in more advanced disease. Majority of leucocytes in the
peripheral blood are blasts and there is often neutropenia
due to marrow infiltration by leukaemic cells. The basic
morphologic features of myeloblasts and lymphoblasts are
summed up in Table 14.1. Typical characteristics of
different forms of AML (M0 to M7) are given in Table
14.5. In some instances, the identification of blast cells is
greatly aided by the company they keep i.e. by more mature
and easily identifiable leucocytes in the company of blastic
cells of myeloid series. Some ‘smear cells’ in the peripheral
blood representing degenerated leucocytes may be seen.
II. BONE MARROW EXAMINATION. An examination
of bone marrow aspirate or trephine reveals the following
features:
1. Cellularity. Typically, the marrow is hypercellular but
sometimes a ‘blood tap’ or ‘dry tap’ occurs. A dry tap in
AML may be due to pancytopenia, but sometimes even

364
SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
when the marrow is so much filled with leukaemic cells
that they cannot be aspirated because the cells are adhesive
and enmeshed in reticulin fibres. In such cases, trephine
biopsy should be done.
2. Leukaemic cells. The bone marrow is generally tightly
packed with leukaemic blast cells. The diagnosis of the
type of leukaemic cells, according to FAB classification, is
generally possible with routine Romanowsky stains but
cytochemical stains may be employed as an adjunct to
Romanowsky staining for determining the type of
leukaemia. The essential criteria for diagnosis of AML, as
per FAB classification, was the presence of at least 30%
blasts in the bone marrow. However, as per WHO
classification, these criteria have been revised and lowered
to 20% blasts in the marrow for labelling and treating a
case as AML.
3. Erythropoiesis. Erythropoietic cells are reduced.
Dyserythropoiesis, megaloblastic features and ring
sideroblasts are commonly present.
4. Megakaryocytes. They are usually reduced or absent.
5. Cytogenetics. Chromosomal analysis of dividing leuka-
emic cells in the marrow shows karyotypic abnormalities
in 75% of cases which may have a relationship to
prognosis. WHO classification emphasises on the
categorisation of AML on the basis of cytogenetic
abnormalities. Two of the most consistent cytogenetic
abnormalities in specific FAB groups are as under:
i) M3 cases have t(15;17)(q22;q12).
ii) M4E0 (E for abnormal eosinophils in the bone marrow)
cases have inv(16)(p13q22).
6. Immunophenotyping.  AML cells express CD13 and
CD33 antigens. M7 shows CD41 and CD42 positivity.
III. CYTOCHEMISTRY. Some of the commonly emplo-
yed cytochemical stains, as an aid to classify the type of
AML are as under (also see Table 14.5):
1. Myeloperoxidase: Positive in immature myeloid cells
containing granules and Auer rods but negative in M0
myeloblasts.
2. Sudan Black: Positive in immature cells in AML.
3. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS): Positive in immature
lymphoid cells and in erythroleukaemia (M6).
4. Non-specific esterase (NSE): Positive in monocytic
series (M4 and M5).
5. Acid phosphatase: Focal positivity in leukaemic blasts
in ALL and diffuse reaction in monocytic cells (M4 and
M5).
IV. BIOCHEMICAL  INVESTIGATIONS. These may be
of some help:
1.  Serum muramidase. Serum levels of lysozyme (i.e.
muramidase) are elevated in myelomonocytic (M4) and
monocytic (M5) leukaemias.
2. Serum uric acid. Because of rapidly growing number
of leukaemic cells, serum uric acid level is frequently
increased. The levels are further raised after treatment
with cytotoxic drugs because of increased cell breakdown.
Treatment and Complications
The management of acute leukaemia involves the following
aspects:
I.
TREATMENT OF ANAEMIA AND HAEMORRHAGE.
Anaemia and haemorrhage are managed by fresh blood
transfusions and platelet concentrates. Patients with severe
thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 20,000/μl) require
regular platelet transfusions since haemorrhage is an
important cause of death in these cases.
II. TREATMENT AND PROPHYLAXIS OF INFECTION.
Neutropenia due to bone marrow replacement by leukaemic
blasts and as a result of intensive cytotoxic therapy renders
these patients highly susceptible to infection. The infections
are predominantly bacterial but viral, fungal, and protozoal
infections also occur. For prophylaxis against infection in
such cases, the patient should be isolated and preferably
placed in laminar airflow rooms. Efforts are made to reduce
the gut and other commensal flora which are the usual source
Figure 14.14
PBF findings in a case of acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML).

365
CHAPTER 14
Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues
of infection. This is achieved by bowel sterilisation and by
topical antiseptics. If these fail to achieve the desired results,
systemic antibiotics and leucocyte concentrates are
considered for therapy.
III.CYTOTOXIC DRUG THERAPY. The aims of cytotoxic
therapy are firstly to induce remission, secondly to continue
therapy to reduce the hidden leukaemic cell population by
repeated courses of therapy. Most commonly, cyclic
combinations of 2, 3 and 4 drugs are given with treatment-
free intervals to allow the bone marrow to recover.
The most effective treatment of AML is a combination of
3 drugs: cytosine arabinoside, anthracyclines (daunorubicin,
adriamycin) and 6-thioguanine. Another addition is
amsacrine (m-AMSA) administered with cytosine
arabinoside, with or without 6-thioguanine. Following
remission-induction therapy, various drug combinations are
given intermittently for maintenance. However,
promyelocytic leukaemia (M3) is treated with tretinoin orally
that reduces the leukaemic cells bearing  t(15;17)(q22;q21)
but devlopment of DIC due to liberation of granules  of dying
cells is a problem.
IV.BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION. Bone
marrow (or stem cell) transplantation from suitable allogenic
or autologous donor (HLA and mixed lymphocytes culture-
matched) is increasingly being used for treating young adults
with AML in first remission. The basic principle of marrow
transplantation is to reconstitute the patient’s haematopoietic
system after total body irradiation and intensive
chemotherapy have been given so as to kill the remaining
leukaemic cells. Bone marrow transplantation has resulted
in cure in about half the cases.
Remission rate with AML is lower (50-70%) than in ALL,
often takes longer to achieve remission, and disease-free
intervals are shorter. AML is most malignant of all
leukaemias; median survival with treatment is 12-18 months.
LYMPHOID NEOPLASMS
Lymphoid cells constitute the immune system of the body.
These cells circulate in the blood and also lie in the lymphoid
tissues and undergo differentiation and maturation in these
organs. The haematopoietic stem cells which form myeloid
and lymphoid series, undergo further differentiation of
lymphoid cells into B cells (including formation of plasma
cells), T cells and NK cells. Lymphoid malignancies can be
formed by malignant transformation of each of these cell
lines. These lymphoid malignancies can range from indolent
to highly aggressive human cancers.
Conventionally, malignancies of lymphoid cells in blood
have been termed as lymphatic leukaemias and those of
lymphoid tissues as lymphomas. Just like myeloid
leukaemias discussed earlier, lymphoid leukaemias have
been classified on the basis of survival and biologic course,
into chronic and acute (CLL and ALL). Similarly, two
clinicopathologically distinct groups of lymphomas are
distinguished: Hodgkin’s lymphoma or Hodgkin’s disease (HD)
and non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL).
However, while HD can be identified by the patho-
gnomonic presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, there have been
controversies and confusion in classification of other
lymphoid cancers (i.e. NHL and lymphoid leukaemias). In
order to resolve the issue, over the years several classification
schemes have emerged for lymphoid cancers due to
following two main reasons:
1.
Biologic course of lymphoma-leukaemia. While some
of the lymphoid malignancies initially present as leukaemias
(i.e. in the blood and bone marrow), many others present as
solid masses in the lymphoid tissues or in various other
tissues, especilly in the spleen, liver, bone marrow and other
tissues. Still others may have initial presentation as either
leukaemia or lymphomas. In fact, the line of demarcation
for lymphoid malignancies is so blurred that during the
biologic course of the disease, lymphoid leukaemia or
lymphoma may spill over and transform to the other.
2. Technological advances. In recent times, modern
diagnostic tools have become available to pathologists and
haematologists which go much beyond making the diagnosis
of lymphomas and leukaemias on clinical grounds combined
with morphology and cytochemical stains alone. This
includes methods for immunophenotyping, cytogenetics and
molecular markers for the stage of differentiation of the cell
of origin rather than location of the cell alone.
These aspects form the basis of current concept for WHO
classification of malignancies of lymphoid cells of blood and
lymphoreticular tissues as ‘lymphoid neoplasms’ as a unified
group. However, it needs to be appreciated that in several
centres in developing countries of the world, limited
laboratory facilities are available. Thus, judiciously speaking,
some of the older classification schemes for lymphoid
malignancies need to be retained, while others can be
dumped as historical. In view of this, a balanced
approach of middle path of retaining old and including new
classification schemes of lymphoid malignancies is
proposed to be followed for discussion below:
I.
HISTORICAL CLASSIFICATIONS. These classifica-
tions can be traced as under:
Morphologic classification. Rappaport classification (1966)
proposed a clinically relevant morphologic classification
based on two main features: low-power microscopy of the
overall pattern of the lymph node architecture, and high-power
microscopy revealing the cytology of the neoplastic cells.
Based on these two features, Rappaport divided NHL into
two major subtypes:
1.
Nodular or follicular lymphomas which retain some of the
features of normal lymph node in that the neoplastic cells
form lymphoid ‘nodules’ rather than lymphoid follicles with
germinal centres.
2.
Diffuse lymphomas, on the other hand, are characterised
by effacement of the normal lymph node architecture and
there may be infiltration of neoplastic cells outside the
capsule of the involved lymph node.
NHL was further classified according to the degree of
differentiation of neoplastic cells into: well-differentiated,

366
SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
poorly-differentiated, and histiocytic (large cells) types of both
nodular and diffuse lymphomas.
Immunologic classifications. Lukes-Collins classification
(1974) was proposed to correlate the type of NHL with the
immune system because the identification of T and B-cells
and their subpopulations had become possible in early 70s.
Its subsequent modification was Kiel classification (1981). Both
these classifications employed immunologic markers for
tumour cells, and divided all malignant lymphomas into
either B-cell or T-cell origin, and rarely of macrophages. The
B and T-cell tumours were further subdivided on the basis
of their light microscopic characteristics. The majority of NHL
were B lymphocyte derivatives and arise from follicular
centre cells (FCC). The FCC in the germinal centre undergo
transformation to become large immunoblasts and pass
through the four stages—small cleaved cells and large cleaved
cells, small non-cleaved cells and large non-cleaved cells.
Though these classification schemes were immuno-
logically correct, they were unclear about varying prognosis
of different clinical types of NHL of either B-cell or T-cell
origin.
II. OLD CLINICOPATHOLOGIC CLASSIFICATIONS. In
view of the objections to above pure morphologic and
immunologically correct classifications, following two
clinically relevant classifications were proposed which cannot
be readily abandoned:
FAB classification of lymphoid leukaemia. Although old,
FAB classification for lymphoid leukaemia was initially
based on morphology and cytochemistry into 3 types of ALL
(L1 to L3), but was subsequently revised to include
cytogenetic and immunologic features as well (Table 14.6).
FAB classification is still followed in many centres where
both pathologists and clinicians  stick to labelling lymphoid
leukaemia separate from lymphomas.
Working Formulations for Clinical Usage (1982). This
classification proposed by a panel of experts from National
Cancer Institute of the US incorporates the best features of
all previous classification systems, and as the name implies,
has strong clinical relevance. Based on the natural history of
disease and long-term survival studies, Working Formula-
tions divides all NHLs into following 3 prognostic groups:
Low-grade NHL: 5-year survival 50-70%
Intermediate-grade NHL: 5-year survival 35-45%
High-grade NHL: 5-year survival 25-35%.
In this classification, no attempt is made to determine
whether the tumour cells have origin from B-cells, T-cells or
macrophages. Each prognostic group includes a few
morphologic subtypes, and lastly, a miscellaneous group is
also described.
Working Formulations still has many takers in several
centres and is retained in Table 14.7.
REAL classification (1994). International Lymphoma Study
Group (Harris et al) proposed another classification called

CHAPTER 14
Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues
revised European-American classification of lymphoid
neoplasms abbreviated as REAL classification. This
classification was based on the hypothesis that all forms of
lymphoid malignancies (NHLs as well as lymphoblastic
leukaemias) represent malignant counterparts of normal
population of immune cells (B-cells, T-cells and histiocytes)
present in the lymph node and bone marrow. It is believed
that lymphoid malignancies arise due to arrest at the various
differentiation stages of B and T-cells since tumours of histio-
cytic origin are quite uncommon. Accordingly, it is
considered essential to understand and correlate the
differentiation stages of B and T-cells with various lymphoid
malignancies (Fig. 14.15). REAL classification divides all
lymphoid malignancies into two broad groups, each having
further subtypes:
Leukaemias and lymphomas of B-cell origin: B-cell derivation
comprises 80% cases of lymphoid leukaemias and 90% cases
of NHLs. Based upon these phenotypic and genotypic
features, B-cell neoplasms are of pre-B and mature B-cell
origin. Based on their biologic behaviour, B-cell malignancies
are further subclassified into indolent and aggressive. All
these tumours express Pan-B (CD19) antigen besides other
markers.
Leukaemias and lymphomas of T-cell origin: T-cell
malignancies comprise the remainder 20% cases of lymphoid
leukaemia and 10% cases of NHLs. T-cell malignancies reflect
the stages of T-cell ontogeny. Like B-cell malignancies, T-
cell derivatives too are further categorised into indolent and
aggressive T-cell malignancies. The most widely expressed
T-cell antigens are CD2 and CD7.
REAL classification subsequently merged into WHO
classification described below.
III. WHO CLASSIFICATION OF LYMPHOID NEO-
PLASMS (1999):  In view of confusion surrounding the
classification schemes of lymphoid cancer, Harris et al, who
described REAL classification, evolved a consensus
international classification of all lymphoid neoplasms together
as a unified group (lymphoid leukaemias-lymphomas) under
the aegis of the WHO. Although this classification has many
similarities with REAL classification as regards identification
of B and T cell types (Fig. 14.15), WHO classification has more
classes. WHO classification takes into account morphology,
clinical features, immunophenotyping, and cytogenetic of the
tumour cells. Hence, on this basis, it is possible to know the
stage of maturity of the neoplastic cell and thus has a better
clinical and therapeutic relevance.

Schematic representation of WHO-REAL classification of lymphoid neoplasms. Various immunophenotypes of B and T-cell
malignancies are correlated with normal immunophenotypic differentiation/maturation stages of B and T-cells in the bone marrow, lymphoid tissue,

Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
As per WHO classification scheme (Table 14.8), all
lymphoid neoplasms (i.e. lymphoid leukaemias and
lymphomas) fall into following 5 categories:
I.
Hodgkin’s disease
II. Precursor (Immature) B-cell malignancies
III. Peripheral (Mature) B-cell malignancies
IV. Precursor (Immature) T-cell malignancies
V. Peripheral (Mature) T-cell and NK–cell malignancies
Thus, in the WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms,
Hodgkin’s disease stands distinctive; remaining four
categories listed above fall into 2 groups:
1) Precursor or immature lymphoid malignancies of B or T
cell origin, meaning blastic type of leukaemias-lymphomas
(mainly B or T-cell ALL); and
2) Peripheral or mature malignancies of B or T cell origin
(meaning CLL and other lymphomas).
GENERAL COMMENTS ON LYMPHOID MALIGNANCIES
Before plunging into discussion of various common examples
in the WHO classification system, a few general aspects on
lymphoid neoplasms need to be understood:
1. Overall frequency: Five major forms of lymphoid
malignancies and their relative frequency are as under:
i)
NHL=  62%, most common lymphoma
ii) HD=  8%
iii) Plasma cell disorders = 15%
iv) CLL= 9%, most common lymphoid leukaemia
v) ALL= 4%
Relative frequency of subtypes within various NHLs listed
in Table 14.8 is as under:
i)
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma = 31%
ii) Follicular lymphoma = 22%
iii) MALT lymphoma = 8%
iv) Mature T cell lymphoma = 8%
v) Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) = 7%
vi) Mantle cell lymphoma = 6%
vii)Mediastinal large B cell lymphoma = 2.5%
viii) Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) = 2.5%
ix) Burkitt’s lymphoma = 2.5%
x) Others = ~10%
2. Incidence of B, T, NK cell malignancies: Majority of
lymphoid malignancies are of B cell origin (75% of lymphoid
leukaemias and 90% of lymphomas) while remaining are T
cell malignancies; NK-cell lymphomas-leukaemias are rare.
3. Diagnosis: The diagnosis of lymphoma (both Hodgkin’s
and non-Hodgkin’s) can only be reliably made on exami-
nation of lymph node biopsy. While the initial diagnosis of
ALL and CLL can be made on CBC examination, bone
marrow biopsy is done for genetic and immunologic studies.
Subsequently, clinical chemistry, electrophoresis and tests
for organ involvement including CSF examination if CNS
involvement is suspected, need to be carried out.
4. Staging:  In both HD and NHL, Ann Arbor staging is done
for proper evaluation and planning treatment.
5. Ancillary studies: CT scan, PET scan and gallium scan
are additional imaging modalities which can be used in
staging HD and NHL cases.

CHAPTER 14
Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues
6. Immune abnormalities: Since lymphoid neoplasms arise
from immune cells of the body, immune derangements
pertaining to the cell of origin may accompany these cancers.
This is particularly so in B-cell malignancies and include
occurrence of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, autoimmune
thrombocytopenia and hypogammaglobulinaemia.
With this background, we now turn to discussion of some
common and important examples of lymphoid malignancies.
HODGKIN’S DISEASE
Hodgkin’s disease (HD) primarily arises within the lymph
nodes and involves the extranodal sites secondarily. This
group comprises about 8% of all cases of lymphoid
neoplasms. The incidence of the disease has bimodal peaks—
one in young adults between the age of 15 and 35 years and
the other peak after 5th decade of life. The HD is more
prevalent in young adult males than females. The classical
diagnostic feature is the presence of Reed-Sternberg (RS) cell
(or Dorothy-Reed-Sternberg cell) (described later).
Classification
The diagnosis of HD requires accurate microscopic diagnosis
by biopsy, usually from lymph node, and occasionally from
other tissues. Unlike NHL, there is only one universally
accepted classification of HD i.e. Rye classification adopted
since 1966. Rye classification divides HD into the following
4 subtypes:
1.
Lymphocyte-predominance type
2.
Nodular-sclerosis type
3.
Mixed-cellularity type
4.
Lymphocyte-depletion type.
However, the WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms
divides HD into 2 main groups:
I. Nodular lymphocyte-predominant HD (a new type).
II. Classic HD (includes all the 4 above subtypes in the Rye
classification).
Central to the diagnosis of HD is the essential
identification of Reed-Sternberg  cell though this is not the sole
criteria (see below).
The salient features of the 4 histologic subtypes of HD
are summarised in Table 14.9.
Reed-Sternberg Cell
The diagnosis of Hodgkin’s disease rests on identification of
RS cells, though uncommonly similar cells can occur in
infectious mononucleosis and other forms of lymphomas.
Therefore, additional cellular and architectural features of
the biopsy must be given due consideration for making the
histologic diagnosis.
There are several morphologic variants of RS cells which
characterise different histologic subtypes of HD (Fig. 14.16):
1.
Classic RS cell is a large cell which has characteristically
a bilobed nucleus appearing as mirror image of each other
but occasionally the nucleus may be multilobed. Each lobe
of the nucleus contains a prominent, eosinophilic, inclusion-
like nucleolus with a clear halo around it, giving an owl-eye
appearance. The cytoplasm of cell is abundant and
amphophilic.
2.
Lacunar type RS cell is smaller and in addition to above
features has a pericellular space or lacuna in which it lies,
which is due to artefactual shrinkage of the cell cytoplasm.
It is characteristically found in nodular sclerosis variety of
HD.
3.
Polyploid type (or popcorn or lymphocytic-histiocytic
i.e. L and H) RS cells are seen in lymphocyte predominance
type of HD. This type of RS cell is larger with lobulated
nucleus in the shape of popcorn.
4.
Pleomorphic RS cells are a feature of lymphocyte
depletion type. These cells have pleomorphic and atypical
nuclei.
The nature and origin of RS cells, which are the real neo-
plastic cells in HD, have been a matter of considerable debate.
One main reason for this difficulty in their characterisation
is that in HD, unlike most other malignancies, the number
of neoplastic cells (i.e. RS cells) is very small (less than 5%)
which are interspersed in the predominant reactive cells.  In
general, the number of RS cells is inversely proportional to

the number of lymphocytes in a particular histologic subtype
of HD.
Immunophenotyping of RS cells reveals monoclonal
lymphoid cell origin of RS cell from B-cells of the germinal
centre in most subtypes of Hodgkin’s disease. RS cells in all
types of Hodgkin’s diseases, except in lymphocyte predomi-
nance type, express immunoreactivity for CD15 and CD30
(Fig. 14.17). RS cells in lymphocyte predominance type,
however, are negative for both CD15 and CD30, but positive
for CD20.
RS cells are invariably accompanied by variable number
of atypical Hodgkin cells which are believed to be precursor
RS cells but are not considered diagnostic of HD. Hodgkin
cells are large mononuclear cells (rather than mirror image
nuclei) having nuclear and cytoplasmic similarity to that of
RS cell.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the gross
appearance of Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
is much the same. Any lymph node group may be
involved but most commonly affected are the cervical,
supraclavicular and axillary groups. Initially, the lymph
nodes are discrete and separate from one another but later
the lymph nodes form a large matted mass due to
infiltration into the surrounding connective tissue.
Extranodal involvements produce either a discrete tumour
or diffuse enlargement of the affected organ. The sectioned
surface of the involved lymph nodes or extranodal organ
involved appears grey-white and fishflesh-like. Nodular
sclerosis type HD may show formation of nodules due to
scarring while mixed cellularity and lymphocyte depletion
types HD may show abundance of necrosis. Lympho-

CHAPTER 14
Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues
matous involvement of the liver, spleen and other organs
may be diffuse or may form spherical masses similar to
metastatic carcinoma.
Microscopically, the criteria for diagnosis of histologic
subtypes of HD are as under:
I.  CLASSIC HD
As per WHO classification, classic group of HD includes
4 types of HD of older Rye classification:
1. Lymphocyte-predominance type (Fig. 14.16,A). The
lymphocyte-predominance type of HD is characterised by
proliferation of small lymphocytes admixed with a
varying number of histiocytes forming nodular or diffuse
pattern.
i)
Nodular form is characterised by replacement of nodal
architecture by numerous large neoplastic nodules.
ii) Diffuse form does not have discernible nodules but
instead there is diffuse proliferation of cells.
However, currently nodular form of lymphocyte
predominent HD has been categorised separately due to
its distinct immunophenotyping features and prognosis
(discussed below).
For making the diagnosis, definite demonstration of
RS cells is essential which are few in number, requiring a
thorough search. In addition to typical RS cells, polyploid
variant having polyploid, and twisted nucleus (popcorn-
like) may be found in some cases. This type of HD usually
does not show other cells like plasma cells, eosinophils
and neutrophils, nor are necrosis or fibrosis seen.
2.
Nodular-sclerosis type (Fig. 14.16,B). Nodular sclero-
sis is the most frequent type of HD, seen more commonly
in women than in men. It is characterised by two essential
features (Fig. 14.18, A):
i)
Bands of collagen: Variable amount of fibrous tissue is
characteristically present in the involved lymph nodes.
Occasionally, the entire lymph node may be replaced by
dense hyalinised collagen.
ii) Lacunar type RS cells: Characteristic lacunar type of RS
cells with distinctive pericellular halo are present. These
cells appear lacunar due to the shrinkage of cytoplasm in
formalin-fixed tissue. The pericellular halo is not seen if
the tissue is fixed in Zenker’s fluid.
In addition to these 2 characteristics, the nodules
between the fibrous septa consist predominantly of
lymphocytes and macrophages, sometimes with foci of
necrosis.
3.
Mixed-cellularity type (Fig. 14.16,C). This form of HD
generally replaces the entire affected lymph nodes by
heterogeneous mixture of various types of apparently
normal cells. These include proliferating lymphocytes,
histiocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils and plasma cells.
Some amount of fibrosis and focal areas of necrosis are
generally present. Typical RS cells are frequent (Fig. 14.18,
B).
4.
Lymphocyte-depletion type (Fig. 14.16,D). In this type
of HD, the lymph node is depleted of lymphocytes. There
are two variants of lymphocyte-depletion HD:
i)
Diffuse fibrotic variant is hypocellular and the entire
lymph node is replaced by diffuse fibrosis, appearing as
homogeneous, fibrillar hyaline material. The area of
hyalinosis contains some lymphocytes, atypical histiocytes
(Hodgkin cells), and numerous typical and atypical
(pleomorphic) RS cells.
ii) Reticular variant is much more cellular and consists of
large number of atypical pleomorphic histiocytes, scanty
lymphocytes and a few typical RS cells.
II. NODULAR LYMPHOCYTE-PREDOMINANT HD
This is a newly described entity which is distinct from the
classic HD described above. This type was previously
included in lymphocyte predominant type of HD. Its
peculiarities are as under:
i)  These cases of HD have a nodular growth pattern
(similar to nodular sclerosis type).
ii) Like lymphocyte-predominant pattern of classic type,
there is predominance of small lymphocytes with  sparse
number of RS cells.
iii) These cases of HD have distinctive immuno-
phenotyping—CD45 positive, epithelial membrane
antigen (EMA) positive but negative for the usual markers
for RS cells (CD15 and CD30 negative).
iv) Though generally it has a chronic relapsing course,
but some cases of this type of HD may transform into large
B-cell NHL.
Clinical Features
Hodgkin’s disease is particularly frequent among young and
middle-aged adults. All histologic subtypes of HD, except
the nodular sclerosis variety, are more common in males.
The disease usually begins with superficial lymph node
enlargement and subsequently spreads to other lymphoid
and non-lymphoid structures.

Most commonly, patients present with painless, movable
and firm lymphadenopathy. The cervical and mediastinal

SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
lymph nodes are involved most frequently. Other lymph
node groups like axillary, inguinal and abdominal are
involved sometimes.
2.
Approximately half the patients develop splenomegaly
during the course of the disease. Liver enlargement too may
occur.
3.
Constitutional symptoms (type B symptoms) are present
in 25-40% of patients. The most common is low-grade fever
with night sweats and weight loss. Other symptoms include
fatigue, malaise, weakness and pruritus.
Other Laboratory Findings
Besides clinical and pathologic findings, there are some
haematologic and immunologic abnormalities in HD.
Haematologic abnormalities:
1.
A moderate, normocytic and normochromic anaemia is
often present.
2.
Serum iron and TIBC are low but marrow iron stores are
normal or increased.
3.
Marrow infiltration by the disease may produce marrow
failure with leucoerythroblastic reaction.
4.
Routine blood counts reveal moderate leukaemoid reaction.
Cases with pruritus frequently show peripheral eosinophilia.
Advanced disease is associated with absolute lymphopenia.
5
Platelet count is normal or increased.
6.
ESR is invariably elevated.
Immunologic abnormalities:
1.
There is progressive fall in immunocompetent T-cells
with defective cellular immunity. There is reversal of CD4: CD8
ratio and anergy to routine skin tests.
2.
Humoral antibody production is normal in untreated
patients until late in the disease.
Staging
Following biopsy and histopathologic classification of HD,
the extent of involvement of the disease (i.e. staging) is
studied in order to select proper treatment and assess the
prognosis. Ann Arbor staging classification takes into account
both clinical and pathologic stage of the disease.
The suffix A or B are added to the above stages depen-
ding upon whether the three constitutional symptoms (fever,
night sweats and unexplained weight loss exceeding 10% of
normal) are absent (A) or present (B). The suffix E or S are
used for extranodal involvement and splenomegaly
respectively (Table 14.10).
For complete staging, a number of other essential diag-
nostic studies are recommended. These are as under:
1.
Detailed physical examination including sites of nodal
involvement and splenomegaly.
2.
Chest radiograph to exclude mediastinal, pleural and
lung parenchymal involvement.
3.
CT scan of abdomen and pelvis.

Finally, histopathologic documentation of the type of
Hodgkin’s disease.
More invasive investigations include lymphangiography
of lower extremities and staging laparotomy. Staging laparotomy
includes biopsy of selected lymph nodes in the
retroperitoneum, splenectomy and wedge biopsy of the liver.
Prognosis
With use of aggressive radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the
outlook for Hodgkin’s disease has improved significantly.
Although several factors affect the prognosis, two important
considerations in evaluating its outcome are the extent of
involvement by the disease (i.e. staging) and the histologic subtype.
With appropriate treatment, the overall 5 years survival
rate for stage I and II A is as high as about 100%, while the
advanced stage of the disease may have upto 50% 5-year
survival rate.
Patients with lymphocyte-predominance type of HD tend to
have localised form of the disease and have excellent
prognosis.
Nodular sclerosis variety too has very good prognosis but
those patients with larger mediastinal mass respond poorly
to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
Mixed cellularity type occupies intermediate clinical
position between the lymphocyte predominance and the
lymphocyte-depletion type, but patients with disseminated
disease and systemic manifestations do poorly.
Lymphocyte-depletion type is usually disseminated at the
time of diagnosis and is associated with constitutional
symptoms. These patients usually have the most aggressive
form of the disease.
The salient features to distinguish Hodgkin’s disease
and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma are summarised in
Table 14.11.
PRECURSOR (IMMATURE) B- AND
T-CELL LEUKAEMIA/LYMPHOMA
(SYNONYM: ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKAEMIA)
Lymphoid malignancy originating from precursor series of
B or T cell (i.e. pre-B and pre-T) is the most common form of
cancer of children under 4 years of age, together constituting
4% of all lymphoid malignancies. Pre-B cell ALL constitutes
90% cases while pre-T cell lymphoid malignancies comprise
the remaining 10%. This group of lymphoid malignancies
arise from more primitive stages of B or T cells but the stage
of differentiation is not related to aggressiveness. Because of
morphologic similarities, both these are presented together.
Clinical Features
PRECURSOR B-CELL LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKAEMIA/
LYMPHOMA. Most often, it presents as ALL in children;
rarely presentation may be in the form of lymphoma in
children or adults and it rapidly transforms into leukaemia.
In cases having leukaemic presentation, extranodal site
involvement is early such as lymphadenopathy accompanied
with hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, CNS infiltration,
testicular enlargement, and at times cutaneous infiltration.
Infections due to cytopenia are present.
PRECURSOR T-CELL LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKAEMIA/
LYMPHOMA. As the name implies, these cases may present
as ALL or as lymphoma. Since the precursor T-cells
differentiate in the thymus, this tumour often presents as
mediastinal mass and pleural effusion and progresses rapidly
to develop leukaemia in the blood and bone marrow.
Clinically, features of bone marrow failure are present which
include anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
Lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and CNS
involvement are frequent.
Precursor T-cell lymphoma-leukaemia is, however, more
aggressive than its B-cell counterpart.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES
Precursor B and T-cell ALL/lymphoma are indistinguish-
able on routine morphology. The diagnosis is made by
following investigations:
1. Blood examination. Peripheral blood generally shows
anaemia and thrombocytopenia, and may show
leucopenia-to-normal TLC-to-leucocytosis. DLC shows
large number of circulating lymphoblasts  having round
to convoluted nuclei, high nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio and
absence of cytoplasmic granularity. It is important to
distinguish AML from ALL; the morphologic features of
myeloblasts and lymphoblasts are contrasted in Table 14.1
for comparison (Fig. 14.19). Typical characteristics of
different forms of ALL (L1 to L3) are given in Table 14.6.
It is usual to find some ‘smear cells’ in the peripheral blood
which represent degenerated leucocytes.

2. Bone marrow examination. Marrow examination shows
malignant undifferentiated cells of precursor B or T cell
origin as demonstrated by immunophenotyping.
Megakaryocytes are usually reduced or absent.
3. Cytochemistry. Cytochemical stains may be employed
as an adjunct to Romanowsky staining for determining
the type of leukaemia. Some of the commonly employed
cytochemical stains in characterisation of leukaemic blasts
in ALL are as under:
i) Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS): Positive in immature lymphoid
cells in ALL.
ii) Acid phosphatase: Focal positivity in leukaemic blasts in
ALL.
iii) Myeloperoxidase: Negative in immature cells in ALL.
iv) Sudan Black: Negative in immature cells in ALL.
v) Non-specific esterase (NSE): Negative in ALL.
Immunophenotyping. TdT (terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase) is expressed by the nuclei of both pre-B and
pre-T stages of differentiation of lymphoid cells.  Specific
diagnosis is eastablished by following immunopheno-
typing:
Pre-B-cell type: Typically positive for pan-B cell markers
CD19, CD10, CD9a.
Pre-T-cell type: Typically positive for CD1, CD2, CD3, CD5,
CD7.
Cytogenetic analysis: Leukaemic blasts in pre-B-cell ALL
show characteristic cytogenetic abnormality of t(9;22) i.e.
Philadelphia positive-ALL.
Treatment
Treatment plan for children with pre-B or pre-T cell ALL is
intensive remission induction with combination therapy.
Patients presenting with pre-B or pre-T cell lymphoma are
treated as a case of ALL.
CHEMOTHERAPY. The most useful drugs in the treatment
of ALL are combination of vincristine, prednisolone,
anthracyclines (daunorubicin, adriamycin) and L-aspara-
ginase. Other agents used are cytosine arabinoside and
methotrexate. Though 90% of children with ALL show
remission with this therapy, patients with T cell ALL and
those with meningeal involvement carry a less favourable
prognosis. CNS involvement is beyond the reach of most
of the cytotoxic drugs used in the therapy of ALL. CNS
prophylaxis in such cases is considered after the initial
remission has been obtained and includes cranial irradiation
and course of intrathecal methotrexate or cytosine
arabinoside.
BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION. Bone marrow
(Stem cell) transplantation from suitable allogenic or
autologous donor (HLA and mixed lymphocytes culture-
matched) is used in preB and pre-T cell ALL in adults with
relapses. Bone marrow transplantation has resulted in cure
in about half the cases.
Prognosis and disease-free survival of children with both
pre-B cell an dpre-T cell ALL is better than in adults. Mean
survival with treatment in children without CNS prophylaxis
is 33 months, while with CNS prophylaxis is 60 months or
more. Adult pre-T cell ALL, however, is as grave as AML
and median survival is 12-18 months. Patients having limited
disease confined to lymph nodes in both pre-B and pre-T
cell type have a higher cure rate and better prognosis.
The salient differences between the two main forms of
acute leukaemia (AML and ALL) are summarised in
Table 14.12.
PERIPHERAL(MATURE) B-CELL MALIGNANCIES
Peripheral or mature B-cell cancers are the most common
lymphoid malignancies. These arise from the stage of
lymphoid cells at which they become committed to B cell
development, acquire surface characteristics  and begin to
secrete immunoglobulins. It includes following common
examples.

B-CELL CLL/SLL (CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC
LEUKAEMIA/ SMALL LYMPHOCYTIC LYMPHOMA)
As the name implies, this subtype may present as leukaemia
or lymphoma constituting 9% of all lymphoid neoplasms.
As lymphoid leukaemia (CLL), this is the most common form
while as SLL it constitutes 7%  of all NHLs. B-cell CLL/SLL
occurs more commonly in middle and older age groups (over
50 years of age) with a male preponderance (male-female
ratio 2:1).
Clinical Features
The condition may remain asymptomatic, or may have an
insidious onset and may present with nonspecific clinical
features. Common presenting manifestations are as under:
1.
Features of anaemia such as gradually increasing
weakness, fatigue and dyspnoea.
2.
Enlargement of superficial lymph nodes is a very common
finding. The lymph nodes are usually symmetrically
enlarged, discrete and non-tender.
3.
Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly are usual.
4.
Haemorrhagic manifestations are found in case of CLL with
thrombocytopenia.
5.
Susceptibility to Infections, particularly of respiratory tract,
are common in CLL.
6.
Less common findings are: mediastinal pressure, tonsillar
enlargement, disturbed vision, and bone and joint pains.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES
The diagnosis of CLL can usually be made on the basis of
physical findings and blood smear examination
(Fig. 14.20):
I. BLOOD PICTURE. The findings of routine blood
picture are as under:
1. Anaemia. Anaemia is usually mild to moderate and
normocytic normochromic in type. Mild reticulocytosis
may be present. About 20% cases develop a Coombs’-
positive autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.
2. White blood cells. Typically, there is marked leuco-
cytosis but less than that seen in CML (50,000-200,000/
μl). Usually, more than 90% of leucocytes are mature small
lymphocytes. Smudge or basket cells (degenerated forms)
are present due to damaged nuclei of fragile malignant
lymphocytes. The absolute neutrophil count is, however,
generally within normal range. Granulocytopenia occurs
when disease is fairly advanced.
3. Platelets. The platelet count is normal or moderately
reduced as an autoimmune phenomenon.
II. BONE MARROW EXAMINATION. The typical
findings are as under:
1. Increased lymphocyte count (25-95%).
2. Reduced myeloid precursors.
3. Reduced erythroid precursors.

Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
III. LYMPH NODE BIOPSY. Cases with lymphadeno-
pathy at presentation show replacement of the lymph
node by diffuse proliferation of well-differentiated,
mature, small and uniform lymphocytes without any
cytologic atypia or significant mitoses (Fig. 14.21,B). These
cells are of monoclonal B-cell origin having immunologic
features of mantle zone B-cells.
IV. OTHER INVESTIGATIONS. These include the
following:
1. Erythrocyte rosette test with mouse red cells is positive
in more than 95% of cases indicating that CLL is a
monoclonal B cell neoplasm.
Figure 14.20
PBF in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). There is large excess of mature and small differentiated lymphocytes and some
degenerated forms appearing as bare smudged nuclei.
2. Positive for B-cell markers e.g. typically CD5 positive;
other pan-B cell markers are CD19, CD20, CD23, surface
immunoglobulins of various classes, monoclonal light
chains (λ or κ type).
3. Serum immunoglobulin levels are generally reduced.
4. Coombs’ test is positive in 20% cases.
5. Cytogenetic abnormalities, most commonly trisomy 12
seen in about 25% cases.
Treatment and Prognosis
Unlike other leukaemias, none of the available drugs and
radiation therapy are capable of eradicating CLL and induce

Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues
true complete remission. Treatment is, therefore, palliative
and symptomatic, and with optimal management patient can
usually lead a relatively normal life for several years. These
approaches include: alkylating drugs (e.g. chlorambucil,
cyclophosphamide), corticosteroids and radiotherapy.
Splenectomy is indicated in cases of CLL with autoimmune
haemolytic anaemia.
Prognosis of CLL/SLL is generally better than CML since
blastic transformation seldom occurs. Prognosis generally
correlates with the stage of disease as under:
Stage A: characterised by lymphocytosis alone, or with limited
lymphadenopathy, has a good prognosis (median survival
more than 10 years).
Stage B: having lymphocytosis with associated significant
lymphadenopathy 
and 
hepatosplenomegaly 
has
intermediate prognosis (median survival about 5 years).
Stage C: having lymphocytosis with associated anaemia and
thrombocytopenia has a worse prognosis (median survival
of less than 2 years).
Generally, the course is indolent. However, some cases of
SLL may transform into more aggressive diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma, or may be associated with occurrence of an IgM
monoclonal gammopathy called Waldenström’s macro-
globulinaemia (page 384).
FOLLICULAR LYMPHOMA
In the earlier classification schemes, follicular lymphoma was
known as nodular (poorly-differentiated) or follicular
lymphoma (predominantly small/large cleaved cell type).
Follicular lymphomas comprise approximately 22% of all
NHLs.  Follicular lymphomas occur in older individuals,
most frequently presenting with painless peripheral
lymphadenopathy which is usually waxing and waning type.
In contrast to diffuse lymphomas, extranodal involvement
is also infrequent.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Following features are
seen:
 Lymph node biopsy: As the name suggests, follicular
lymphoma is characterised by follicular or nodular pattern
of growth. The nuclei of tumour cells may vary from
predominantly small cleaved (or indented) to
predominantly large cleaved variety (Fig. 14.21,C). The
former is more common, has infrequent mitoses and the
rate of growth slow (low grade), while the patients with
large cell lymphoma have high proliferation and progress
rapidly (high grade). In all follicular lymphomas, the
tumour cells are positive for pan-B markers such as CD19
and CD20 along with expression of  BCL-2 protein (for
distinction from normal germinal centre which is BCL-2
negative). Cytogenetic studies show characteristic trans-
location t(14;18) in tumour cells.
Blood and bone marrow: Peripheral blood involvement
as occurs in SLL is uncommon in this variety. Infiltration
in the bone marrow is typically paratrabecular.
About half the cases of low-grade follicular lymphomas,
during their indolent biologic course, may evolve into diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma. Median survival for patients with
low grade follicular lymphoma is 7-9 years.
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, earlier termed as diffuse
poorly-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma or follicular
centre cell diffuse large, cleaved/non-cleaved lymphoma, is
the most common comprising about 31% of all NHLs. It
occurs in older patients with mean age of 60 years. It may
present primarily as a lymph node disease or at extranodal
sites. About half the cases have extranodal involvement at
the time of presentation, particularly in the bone marrow
and the alimentary tract. Primary diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma of CNS may also occur.
A few subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are
described with distinct clinicopathologic settings:
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has been etiologically
implicated in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in immuno-
suppressed patients of AIDS and organ transplant cases.
Human herpes virus type 8 (HHV-8) infection along with
presence of immunosuppression is associated with a subtype
of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma presenting with effusion,
termed primary effusion lymphoma.
Mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma is diagnosed in patients
with prominent involvement of mediastinum, occurs in
young females and frequently spreads to CNS and abdominal
viscera.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  This variety is the diffuse
counterpart of follicular large cleaved cell lymphoma i.e.
it is composed of large cleaved cells spread in a diffuse
pattern. The cytoplasm in these tumour cells is pale and
abundant while the nuclei have prominent 1-2 nucleoli.
Immunophenotypic markers for pan-B cells (CD19, CD20)
are positive, besides overexpression of surface immuno-
globulins (IgM, IgG and light chains) and of BCL-2 protein.
In general, diffuse large B-cell lymphomas are aggressive
tumours and disseminate widely.
BURKITT’S LYMPHOMA/LEUKAEMIA
 Burkitt’s lymphoma/leukaemia is an uncommon tumour in
adults but comprises about 30% of childhood NHLs. Burkitt’s
leukaemia corresponds to L3 ALL of FAB grouping and is
uncommon.  Three subgroups of Burkitt’s lymphoma are
recognised: African endemic, sporadic and immunodeficiency-
associated.:
African endemic Burkitt’s lymphoma was first described
in African children, predominantly presenting as jaw tumour
that spreads to extranodal sites such as the bone marrow
and meninges. The relationship of this tumour with
oncogenic virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), has been discussed
in Chapter 8.
Sporadic Burkitt’s lymphoma is a related tumour in which
the tumour cells are similar to those of Burkitt’s lymphoma
but are more pleomorphic and may sometimes be multi-
nucleated. Sporadic variety has a propensity to infiltrate the
CNS and is more aggressive than true Burkitt’s lymphoma.
Immunodeficiency-associated Burkitt’s lymphoma includes
cases seen in association with HIV infection.

378
SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Histologically all three
types of Burkitt’s lymphoma are similar. Tumour cells are
intermediate in size, non-cleaved, and homogeneous in
size and shape.  The nuclei are round to oval and contain
2-5 nucleoli. The cytoplasm is basophilic and contains lipid
vacuolation. The tumour cells have a very high mitotic
rate, and therefore high cell death. This feature accounts
for presence of numerous macrophages in the background
of this tumour containing phagocytosed tumour debris
giving it a ‘starry sky’ appearance (Fig. 14.22).
Burkitt’s leukaemia is identified by classical appearance
of monomorphic medium-sized cells having round nuclei,
frequent mitoses, multiple nucleoli, and basophilic
cytoplasm with vacuoles.
Immunophenotypically, the tumour cells are positive
for CD19 and CD10 and surface immunoglobulin IgM.
Typical cytogenetic abnormalities in the tumour cells are
t(8;14) and  t(8;22) involving MYC gene on chromosome
8, with overexpression of MYC protein having trans-
forming activity.
Burkitt’s lymphoma is a high-grade tumour and is a very
rapidly progressive human tumour.
EXTRANODAL MARGINAL ZONE B-CELL LYMPHOMA
OF MALT TYPE (SYNONYM: MALTOMA)
This type comprises about 8% of all NHLs. In the earlier
classification, it was included under SLL, but in the WHO
scheme it is categorised separately for 2 reasons: etiologic
association with H. pylori infection and occurrence at
extranodal sites. Most frequent is gastric lymphoma of MALT
type with its characteristic etiologic association with H. pylori;
other extranodal sites for this subtype of NHL are intestine,
orbit, lung, thyroid, salivary glands and CNS. About half
the cases of gastric MALT lymphoma show Genetic mutation
t(11;18). Median age for this form of NHL is 60 years and
often remains localised to the organ of origin but may
infiltrate the regional lymph nodes.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. It is characterised by
diffuse infiltration by monoclonal small B lymphocytes
which are negative for CD5.
MALT lymphoma has a good prognosis. Rarely, it may
be more aggressive and may metastasise, or transform into
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
MANTLE CELL LYMPHOMA
This subtype of NHL comprises about 8% of all NHLs. It
was earlier included in SLL but has been identified as a
separate subtype due to characteristic chromosomal
translocation, t(11;14) and overexpression of BCL-1 and
surface immunoglobulins IgM and IgD protein. However,
both SLL and mantle cell NHL are positive for CD5 antigen.
Patients of mantle cell lymphoma are generally older males.
The disease involves bone marrow, spleen, liver and bowel.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Mantle cell lymphoma
arises from B-cells of mantle zone of normal lymphoid
follicle. The tumour cells show diffuse or nodular pattern
of involvement in the lymph node and have somewhat
indented nuclei.
It is more aggressive than other types of SLLs.
HAIRY CELL LEUKAEMIA
Hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) is an unusual and uncommon
form of B-cell malignancy characterised by presence of hairy
cells in the blood and bone marrow and splenomegaly. It
occurs in the older males. HCL is characterised clinically by
the manifestations due to infiltration of reticuloendothelial
organs (bone marrow, liver and spleen) and, hence, its
previous name as leukaemic reticuloendotheliosis. Patients have
susceptibility to infection with M. avium intercellulare.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Laboratory diagnosis is
made by the presence of pancytopenia due to marrow
Figure 14.22
Burkitt’s lymphoma. The tumour shows uniform cells having high mitotic rate. Scattered among the tumour cells are benign
macrophages surrounded by a clear space giving ‘starry sky’ appearance.

CHAPTER 14
Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues
failure and splenic sequestration, and identification of
characteristic hairy cells in the blood and bone marrow.
Hairy cells are abnormal mononuclear cells with hairy
cytoplasmic projections which are seen in the bone
marrow, peripheral blood and spleen. These cells are best
recognised under phase contrast microscopy but may also
be visible in routine blood smears (Fig. 14.23). These
leukaemic ‘hairy cells’ have characteristically positive
cytochemical staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase
(TRAP).
The controversy on the origin of hairy cells whether
these cells represent neoplastic T cells, B cells or
monocytes, is settled with the molecular analysis of these
cells which assigns them B cell origin expressing CD19,
CD20 and CD22 antigen. In addition to B cell markers,
hairy cells are also positive for CD11, CD25 and CD103.
The disease often runs a chronic course requiring
supportive care. The mean survival is 4-5 years. Patients
respond to splenectomy, α-interferon therapy and 2-
chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA).
OTHER B-CELL MALIGNANCIES
Brief mention is made below on the other types of B-cell
malignant tumours given in the  WHO classification in
Table 14.8:
i) B-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia is involvement of blood and
bone marrow by large B lymphocytes having prominent
nucleoli. These patients have leucocytosis with splenomegaly
and lymphadenopathy.
ii) Splenic marginal zone lymphoma is another uncommon B-
cell neoplasm in which the splenic white pulp is infiltrated
by small monoclonal B lymphocytes. The condition has a
slow and indolent behaviour.
iii) Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma is tissue manifestation of
Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia, discussed later in this
chapter. There is infiltration by IgM-secreting monoclonal
lymphoplasmacytic cells into lymph nodes, spleen, bone
marrow, and sometimes in the peripheral blood. It behaves
like an indolent B-cell lymphoma. Etiologic association of
this form of lymphoma with hepatitis C virus infection has
also been proposed.
iv) Nodal marginal zone lymphoma (monocytoid B-cell lymphoma)
is another uncommon subtype of aggressive NHL. At
presentation, the patients often have disseminated disease,
involving bone marrow and leukaemic picture.
PERIPHERAL(MATURE) T-CELL MALIGNANCIES
Peripheral or mature T-cell lymphoid malignancies are
relatively less common compared to mature B cell cancers.
These arise at the stage when the lymphoid cells migrate to
thymus and become committed to T-cell differentiation by
acquiring T cell antigen receptor genes. A few common
examples are discussed below.
MYCOSIS FUNGOIDES/SÉZARY SYNDROME
Mycosis fungoides is a slowly evolving cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma occurring in middle-aged adult males.
MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES. The condition is often
preceded by eczema or dermatitis for several years
(premycotic stage). This is followed by infiltration by CD4+T-
cells in the epidermis and dermis as a plaque (plaque stage)
and eventually as tumour stage. The disease may spread to
viscera and to peripheral blood as a leukaemia
characterised by Sézary cells having cerebriform nuclei
termed as Sézary syndrome.
Mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome is an indolent NHL
and has a median survival of 8 to 9 years.
ADULT T-CELL LYMPHOMA/LEUKAEMIA (ATLL)
This is an uncommon T-cell malignancy but has gained much
prominence due to association with retrovirus, human T-cell

biopsy shows replacement of marrow spaces with abnormal mononuclear cells.

lymphotropic virus-I (HTLV-I) (Chapter 8). The infection is
acquired by blood transfusion, breast milk, sexual route or
transplacentally.  ATLL is common in Japan, the Caribbean
and parts of the US but is rare in rest of the world.
MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES. The involved lymph
nodes have proliferation of CD4 positive large atypical T-
cells with indented nuclei, called ‘flower cells’, most
prominent in the paracortical zone. The blood also shows
large pleomorphic T-cell leukaemia.
The patients have usually widespread lymphadenopathy
with leukaemia, hepatosplenomegaly and involvement of
skin and leptomeninges. This disease runs a fulminant
course.
ANAPLASTIC LARGE T/NK CELL LYMPHOMA
This relatively newer entity is the T-cell counterpart of diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma and was previously included under
malignant histiocytosis or diagnosed as anaplastic carcinoma.
MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES. There is diffuse
infiltration of lymph nodes by anaplastic T-cells/null cells
positive for CD30 (Ki-1). Cytogenetic abnormality consists
of t(2;5). Involvement of the skin occurs frequently and
produces an indolent cutaneous large T/null cell
lymphoma.
PERIPHERAL T-CELL LYMPHOMAS
This group includes a variety of aggressive T-cell lymphomas
which are morphologically heterogeneous but have common
immunotypic features of mature T-cells (CD4+, CD8+, or
both). These are more common in young adults and often
have bone marrow involvement at presentation. Subtypes
of peripheral T-cell lymphomas include the following
syndromes:
i) Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is relatively more
common subtype, comprising about 20% of all T-cell NHLs.
The patients have profound constitutional symptoms (fever,
weight loss, skin rash), generalised lymphadenopathy and
polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia.
ii) Extranodal T/NK cell lymphoma of nasal type is involvement
of the upper airways by the monoclonal T-cells. The condition
is quite aggressive and was earlier called as lethal midline
granuloma or angiocentric lymphoma. The patients have
haemophagocytic syndrome. During the course of the
disease, blood and bone marrow may be involved producing
leukaemic picture.
iii) Enteropathy type T-cell lymphoma is a rare aggressive
lymphoma seen in association with untreated cases of gluten-
sensitive enteropathy.
iv) Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, unlike other lymphomas
which occur as tumour masses, is characterised by sinusoidal
infiltration of the liver, spleen and bone marrow by
monoclonal T-cells. Systemic features are often present.
Staging of NHL
The Ann Arbor staging system developed for Hodgkin’s
disease (see Table 14.10, page 372) is used for staging NHL
too. This staging system depends upon the number and
location of nodal and extranodal sites involved, and presence
or absence of constitutional (B) symptoms. But the concept
of staging is much less helpful in NHL than in Hodgkin’s
disease because the prognosis is not correlated with the
anatomic site of involvement of the disease.
PLASMA CELL DISORDERS
The plasma cell disorders are characterised by abnormal
proliferation of immunoglobulin-producing cells and result
in accumulation of monoclonal immunoglobulin in serum
and urine. The group as a whole is known by various
synonyms such as plasma cell dyscrasias, paraproteinaemias,
dysproteinaemias and monoclonal gammopathies. The group
comprises the following six disease entities:
1.
Multiple myeloma
2.
Localised plasmacytoma
3.
Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (discussed above)
3.
Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia
4.
Heavy chain disease
5.
Primary amyloidosis (Chapter 4)
6.
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
(MGUS).
The feature common to all plasma cell disorders is the
neoplastic proliferation of cells derived from B-lymphocyte
lineage. These disorders constitute 16% of all B-cell
malignancies. Normally B lymphocytes have surface
immunoglobulin molecules of both M and G heavy chains.
Under normal circumstances, B-cells are stimulated by
exposure to surface immunoglobulin-specific antigen and
mature to form IgG-producing plasma cells. However, in
plasma cell disorders, the control over this process is lost
and results in abnormal production of immunoglobulin that
appears in the blood and urine. These disorders differ from
other B-cell lymphoid malignancies in having monoclonal
synthesis of immunoglobulins and lack of prominent lymph-
adenopathy. In addition to the rise in complete immuno-
globulins, plasma cell disorders synthesise excess of light
chains (kappa or lambda), or heavy chains of a single class
(alpha, gamma, or mu). Bence Jones proteins are free light
chains present in blood and excreted in urine of some plasma
cell disorders.
After these brief general comments, we now turn to the
discussion of the specific plasma cell disorders.
MULTIPLE MYELOMA
Multiple myeloma is a multifocal malignant proliferation of
plasma cells derived from a single clone of cells (i.e.
monoclonal). The terms multiple myeloma is used
interchangeably with myeloma. The tumour, its products (M
component), and the host response result in the most
important and most common syndrome in the group of
plasma cell disorders that produces osseous as well as
extraosseous manifestations. Multiple myeloma primarily
affects the elderly (peak incidence in 5th-6th decades) and
increases in incidence with age. It is rare under the age of 40.
Myeloma is more common in males than females.

381
CHAPTER 14
Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Myeloma is a monoclonal proliferation of B-cells. The etiology
of myeloma remains unknown. However, following factors
and abnormalities have been implicated:
1.
Radiation exposure. Large dose exposure to radiation
with a long latent period has been seen in myeloma. For
instance, survivors of nuclear attack in World War-II
developed myeloma about 20 years later.
2.
Epidemiologic factors. Myeloma has higher incidence in
blacks. Occupational exposure to petroleum products has
been associated with higher incidence. Certain occupations
such as farmers, wood workers and leather workers are more
prone.
3.
Karyotypic abnormalities. Several chromosomal
alterations have been observed in cases of myeloma, which
include following translocations and deletions:
i)
Translocations t(11;14)(q13;q32) and t(4;14)(p16;q32).
ii) Deletion of 13q.
4.
Oncogenes-antioncogenes. Overexpresion and muta-
tions in following genes have been noted in proliferation of
tumour cells in myeloma:
i) Overexpression of MYC  and RAS growth promoting
oncogenes in some cases.
ii)  Mutation in p53 and RB growth-suppressing antioncogene
in some cases.
Based on above, the molecular pathogenesis of multiple
myeloma and its major manifestations can be explained as
under and is schematically illustrated in Fig. 14.24:
1. Cell-surface adhesion molecules bind myeloma cells to bone
marrow stromal cells and extracellular matrix proteins.
2. This binding triggers adhesion-mediated signaling and
mediates production of several cytokines by fibroblasts and
macrophages of the marrow. These include: IL-6, VEGF,
TGFβ, TNF-α IL-1, lymphotoxin, macrophage inhibitory
factor-1α (MIP-1α) and receptor activator of nuclear
factor-κB (RANK) ligand.
3. Adhesion-mediated signaling affects the cell cycle via
cyclin-D and p21 causing abnormal production of myeloma
(M) proteins.
4. IL-6 cytokine plays a central role in cytokine-mediated
signaling and causes proliferation as well as cell survival of
tumour cells via its antiapoptotic effects on tumour cells.
5. Certain cytokines produced by myeloma cells bring about
bony destruction by acting as osteoclast-activating factor (OAF).
These are: IL-1, lymphotoxin, VEGF, macrophage inhibitory
factor-1α (MIP-1α), receptor activator of NF-κB ligand, and
tumour necrosis factor (TNF).
6. Other effects of adhesion-mediated and cytokine-mediated
signaling are development of drug resistance and migration of
tumour cells in the bone marrow milieu.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Myeloma affects princi-
pally the bone marrow though during the course of the
disease other organs are also involved. Therefore, the
pathologic findings are described below under two
headings—osseous (bone marrow) lesions and extraosseous
lesions.
A. OSSEOUS (BONE MARROW) LESIONS. In more
than 95% of cases, multiple myeloma begins in the bone
marrow. In majority of cases, the disease involves multiple
bones. By the time the diagnosis is made, most of the bone
marrow is involved. Most commonly affected bones are
those with red marrow i.e. skull, spine, ribs and pelvis,
but later long bones of the limbs are also involved
(Fig. 14.25). The lesions begin in the medullary cavity,
erode the cancellous bone and ultimately cause
destruction of the bony cortex. Radiographically, these
lesions appear as punched out, rounded, 1-2 cm sized
defects in the affected bone.
Grossly, the normal bone marrow is replaced by soft,
gelatinous, reddish-grey tumours. The affected bone
usually shows focal or diffuse osteoporosis.
Microscopically, the diagnosis of multiple myeloma can
be usually established by examining bone marrow
aspiration from an area of bony rarefaction. However, if
the bone marrow aspiration yields dry tap or negative
results, biopsy of radiologically abnormal or tender site
is usually diagnostic. The following features characterise
a case of myeloma:
Figure 14.24

of multiple myeloma and its major manifestations.

SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
i)
Cellularity: There is usually hypercellularity of the
bone marrow.
ii) Myeloma cells: Myeloma cells constitute >10% of the
marrow cellularity. These cells may form clumps or sheets,
or may be scattered among the normal haematopoietic
cells. Myeloma cells may vary in size from small,
differentiated cells resembling normal plasma cells to
large, immature and undifferentiated cells. Binucleate and
multinucleate cells are sometimes present. The nucleus
of myeloma cell is commonly eccentric similar to plasma
cells but usually lacks the cart-wheel chromatin pattern
seen in classical plasma cells. Nucleoli are frequently
present. The cytoplasm of these cells is abundant and
basophilic with perinuclear halo, vacuolisation and
contains Russell bodies consisting of hyaline globules
composed of synthesised immunoglobulin (Fig. 14.26).
In addition to neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells
in multiple myeloma, reactive plasmacytosis in the bone
marrow can occur in some other disorders; these include:
aplastic anaemia, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, cirrhosis of
liver, metastatic cancer and chronic inflammation and
infections such as tuberculosis. However, in all these
conditions the plasma cells are mature and they do not
exceed 10% of the total marrow cells.
B. EXTRAOSSEOUS LESIONS. Late in the course of
disease, lesions at several extraosseous sites become
evident. Some of the commonly involved sites are as
under:
1.
Blood. Approximately 50% of patients with multiple
myeloma have a few atypical plasma cells in the blood.
Other changes in the blood in myeloma are the presence
of anaemia (usually normocytic normochromic type),
marked red cell rouleaux formation due to hypervisco-
sity of blood, and an elevated ESR.
2.
Myeloma kidney. Renal involvement in myeloma
called myeloma nephrosis occurs in many cases (Chapter
22). The main mechanism of myeloma kidney is by
filtration of light chain proteins (Bence Jones proteins)
which are precipitated in the distal convoluted tubules in
combination with Tamm-Horsfall proteins as tubular
casts. The casts may be surrounded by some multinucleate
giant-cells and a few inflammatory cells.
3.
Myeloma neuropathy. Infiltration of the nerve trunk
roots by tumour cells produces nonspecific polyneuro-
pathy. Pathologic fractures, particularly of the vertebrae,
may occur causing neurologic complications.
4.
Systemic amyloidosis. Systemic primary generalised
amyloidosis (AL amyloid) may occur in 10% cases of
multiple myeloma and involve multiple organs and
systems.

CHAPTER 14
Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues
5.
Liver, spleen involvement. Involvement of the liver
and spleen by myeloma cells sufficient to cause
hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly occurs in a small
percentage of cases.
Clinical Features
The clinical manifestations of myeloma result from the effects
of infiltration of the bones and other organs by neoplastic
plasma cells and from immunoglobulin synthesis. The
principal clinical features are as under:
1.
Bone pain is the most common symptom. The pain usually
involves the back and ribs. Pathological fractures may occur
causing persistent localised pain. Bone pain results from the
proliferation of tumour cells in the marrow and activation of
osteoclasts which destroy the bones.
2.
Susceptibility to infections is the next most common clinical
feature. Particularly common are bacterial infections such
as pneumonias and pyelonephritis. Increased susceptibility
to infection is related mainly to hypogammaglobulinaemia,
and partly to granulocyte dysfunction and neutropenia.
3.
Renal failure occurs in about 25% of patients, while renal
pathology occurs in 50% of cases. Causes of renal failure in
myeloma are hypercalcaemia, glomerular deposits of
amyloid, hyperuricaemia and infiltration of the kidney by
myeloma cells.
4.
Anaemia occurs in about 80% of patients of myeloma and
is related to marrow replacement by the tumour cells
(myelophthisis) and inhibition of haematopoiesis.
5.
Bleeding tendencies may appear in some patients due to
thrombocytopenia, deranged platelet function and
interaction of the M component with coagulation factors.
6. Hyperviscosity syndrome owing to hyperglobulinaemia may
produce headache, fatigue, visual disturbances and
haemorrhages.
7. Neurologic symptoms occur in a minority of patients and
are explained by hyperviscosity, cryoglobulins and amyloid
deposits.
8. Biochemical abnormalities. These include the following:
i) hypercalcaemia due to destruction of bone;
ii) hyperuricaemia from necrosis of tumour mass and from
uraemia related to renal failure; and
iii) increased β-2 microglobulins and other globulins in urine
and serum.
9. POEMS syndrome is seen in about 1% cases of myeloma
and includes simultaneous manifestations of polyneuro-
pathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, multiple myeloma
and skin changes.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of myeloma is made by classic triad of features:
1.
Marrow plasmacytosis of more than 10%
2.
Radiologic evidence of lytic bony lesions
3.
Demonstration of serum and/or urine M component.
There is rise in the total serum protein concentration due
to paraproteinaemia but normal serum immunoglobulins (IgG,
IgA and IgM) and albumin are depressed. Paraproteins are
abnormal immunoglobulins or their parts circulating in
plasma and excreted in urine. About two-third cases of
myeloma excrete Bence Jones (light chain) proteins in the
urine, consisting of either kappa (κ) or lambda (λ) light chains,
along with presence of Bence Jones paraproteins in the serum.
On serum electrophoresis, the paraprotein usually appears
as a single narrow homogeneous M-band component, most
commonly in the region of γ-globulin (Fig. 14.27). Most
frequent paraprotein is IgG seen in about 50% cases of
myeloma, IgA in 25%, and IgD in 1%, while about 20%
patients have only light chains in serum and urine (light chain
myeloma). Non-secretory myeloma is absence of M-band on
serum and/or electrophoresis but presence of other two
features out of triad listed above. Though the commonest
cause of paraproteinaemias is multiple myeloma, certain
other conditions which may produce serum paraproteins
need to be distinguished. These are as under:
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
(MGUS)
Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia
Benign monoclonal gammopathy
B-cell lymphomas
CLL
Light chain disease
Heavy chain disease
Cryoglobulinaemia.

SECTION II
Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment of multiple myeloma consists of systemic
chemotherapy in the form of alkylating agents and
symptomatic supportive care. Autologous stem cell
transplantation and interferon-therapy are the other modern
treatment modalities offered.  Poor prognostic predictors for
lower survival are: secretion of λ-light chain than those
secreting κ-light chain, larger number of cytogenetic
abnormalities, and increased β-2 microglobulin level. The
median survival is 2 years after the diagnosis is made. The
terminal phase is marked by the development of
pancytopenia, severe anaemia and sepsis.
LOCALISED PLASMACYTOMA
Two variants of myeloma which do not fulfil the criteria of
classical triad are the localised from of solitary bone
plasmacytoma and extramedullary plasmacytoma. Both these are
associated with M component in about a third of cases and
occur in young individuals. Solitary bone plasmacytoma is
a lytic bony lesion without marrow plasmacytosis.
Extramedullary plasmacytoma involves most commonly the
submucosal lymphoid tissue of nasopharynx or paranasal
sinuses. Both variants have better prognosis than the classic
multiple myeloma. Plasma cell granuloma, on the other hand,
is an inflammatory condition having admixture of other
inflammatory cells with mature plasma cells, which can be
easily distinguished by a discernible observer.
WALDENSTRÖM’S MACROGLOBULINAEMIA
Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia is an uncommon
malignant proliferation of monoclonal B lymphocytes which
secrete IgM paraproteins called macroglobulins as they have
high molecular weight. The condition is more common in
men over 50 years of age and behaves clinically like a slowly
progressive lymphoma.
The exact etiology is not known but a possible relation-
ship of IgM macroglobulin with myelin-associated
glycoprotein which is lost in degenerating diseases has been
suggested. The clinical evidence in favour is the appearance
of peripheral neuropathy before the occurrence of macro-
globulinaemia in some patients.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Pathologically, the disease
can be regarded as the hybrid between myeloma and small
lymphocytic lymphoma.
Like myeloma, the disease involves the bone marrow,
but unlike myeloma it usually does not cause extensive
bony lesions or hypercalcaemia. The bone marrow shows
pleomorphic infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells,
lymphocytoid plasma cells, mast cells and histiocytes. Like
in myeloma, serum M component is present.
Unlike myeloma and more like small lymphocytic
lymphoma, enlargement of lymph nodes, spleen and liver
due to infiltration by similar type of cells is present more
frequently.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The clinical features of the disease
are due to both infiltration by the disease and paraproteins
in the blood.
1.
Hyperviscosity syndrome is the major clinical manifestation.
It results in visual disturbances, weakness, fatiguability,
weight loss and nervous system symptoms. Raynaud’s
phenomenon may occur.
2.
Moderate organomegaly in the form of lymphadenopathy,
hepatomegaly and splenomegaly are frequently seen.
3.
Anaemia due to bone marrow failure may be present.
4.
Bleeding tendencies may occur due to interaction of
macroglobulins with platelets and coagulation factors.
DIAGNOSIS. Unlike myeloma, there are no characteristic
radiologic findings. The diagnosis rests on laboratory data
as under:
1.
Pleomorphic bone marrow infiltration
2.
Raised total serum protein concentration
3.
Raised serum monoclonal M component which is due to
IgM paraprotein
4.
Elevated ESR
5.
Normocytic normochromic anaemia.
The management of the patients is similar to that of
myeloma. Patients respond to chemotherapy with a median
survival of 3-5 years.
HEAVY CHAIN DISEASES
Heavy chain diseases are rare malignant proliferations of B-
cells accompanied by monoclonal excess of one of the heavy
chains. Depending upon the type of excessive heavy chain,
three types—γ, α and μ, of heavy chain diseases are
distinguished:
GAMMA HEAVY CHAIN DISEASE. Also called Franklin’s
disease, it is characterised by excess of mostly γ1-paraprotein,
both in the serum and urine and is demonstrated as M
component. Clinically, the condition may develop at any age
and present with lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly,
hepatomegaly, involvement of pharyngeal lymphoid tissue
(Waldeyer’s ring) and fever. Patients have rapidly downhill
course due to severe and fatal infection.
ALPHA HEAVY CHAIN DISEASE. This is the commonest
of heavy chain diseases characterised by α-heavy chains in
the plasma which are difficult to demonstrate in electropho-
resis due to rapid polymerisation. The patients present with
bowel symptoms such as chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption
and weight loss and may have enlargement of abdominal
lymph nodes. Chemotherapy may induce long-term
remissions.
MU HEAVY CHAIN DISEASE. This is the rarest heavy
chain disease. The neoplastic B-cells produce μ heavy chains
which donot appear in the urine but κ light chains which are
also produced appear in the urine. Another feature that
distinguishes this type of heavy chain disease from the others
is the presence of vacuoles in the malignant B lymphocytes.
The course and prognosis are like those of leukaemia or
lymphoma.
MONOCLONAL GAMMOPATHY OF UNDETERMINED
SIGNIFICANCE (MGUS)
A relatively recently desribed entity, monoclonal gammo-
pathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), is increasingly

385
CHAPTER 14
Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues
diagnosed in asymptomatic healthy aging population—1%
at 50 years of age and in 10% individuals older than 75 years.
This makes it the most common form of plasma cell dyscrasia.
The defining criteria for MGUS are as under:
i) M-protein in serum <3 gm/dl
ii) Marrow plasmacytosis <10%
iii) No evidence of other B-cell proliferative disorder
iv) Absence of myeloma-related end-organ tissue damage
(i.e. absence of lytic bone lesions, high calcium level,
anaemia).
The condition needs to be cautiously distinguished from
myeloma and long term follow-up is required. In fact, MGUS
has been considered as a forerunner of multiple myeloma in
many studies because MGUS has been found to have the
same chromosomal abnormalities as in myeloma.
LYMPH NODE METASTATIC TUMOURS
The regional lymph nodes draining the site of a primary
malignant tumour are commonly enlarged. This enlargement
may be due to benign reactive hyperplasia or metastatic tumour
deposits.
1.
Benign reactive hyperplasia, as already discussed (page
343), is due to immunologic reaction by the lymph node in
response to tumour-associated antigens. It may be expressed
as sinus histiocytosis, follicular hyperplasia, plasmacytosis
and occasionally may show non-caseating granulomas.
2.
Metastatic deposits in regional lymph nodes occur most
commonly from carcinomas and malignant melanoma.
Sarcomas often disseminate via haematogenous route but
uncommonly may metastasise to the regional lymph nodes.
Metastatic tumour cells from the primary malignant tumour
are drained via lymphatics into the subcapsular sinuses
initially but subsequently the lymph node stroma is also
invaded. The pushing margins of advancing metastatic
tumour in stroma of lymph node is characteristically well
demarcated. Areas of necrosis are frequent in metastatic carci-
nomas (Fig. 14.28).
The morphologic features of primary malignant tumour
are recapitulated in metastatic tumour in lymph nodes.
HISTIOCYTIC NEOPLASMS:
LANGERHANS’ CELL HISTIOCYTOSIS
Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a group of rare
malignant proliferations of dendritic cells or macrophages
and includes three clinicopathologically related conditions
ocurring in children: eosinophilic granuloma, Hand-Schüller-
Christian disease and Letterer-Siwe syndrome. Earlier, this
group was referred to as histiocytosis-X but now following
facts about this group are known:
Firstly, histiocytosis-X are not proliferations of unknown
origin (X-for unknown) but proliferating cells are actually
Langerhans’ cells of marrow origin. Langerhans’ cells are
normally present mainly in the epidermis of the skin but also
in some other organs.
Secondly, the three conditions included under histio-
cytosis-X are actually different expression of the same basic
disorder. This concept has emerged from 2 features:
i) Demonstration of common antigens on these cells by
immunohistochemical stains for S-100 protein, CD1a and HLA-
DR.
ii) Electron microscopic demonstration of histiocytosis-X bodies
or Birbeck granules in the cytoplasm. These are rod-shaped
structures having dilated tennis-racket like terminal end.
Their function is not known but they arise from receptor-
mediated endocytosis of langerin found in human epidermal
cells, a protein involved in Birbeck granule biosynthesis.
The three disorders included in the group are briefly
considered below.
Eosinophilic Granuloma
Unifocal eosinophilic granuloma is more common (60%) than
the multifocal variety which is often a component of Hand-
Schüller-Christian disease (described below). Most of the
patients are children and young adults, predominantly males.
The condition commonly presents as a solitary osteolytic
lesion in the femur, skull, vertebrae, ribs and pelvis. The
diagnosis requires biopsy of the lytic bone lesion.
Microscopically, the lesion consists largely of closely-
packed aggregates of macrophages admixed with variable
number of eosinophils (Fig. 14.29). The macrophages
contain droplets of fat or a few granules of brown pigment
indicative of phagocytic activity. A few multinucleate
macrophages may also be seen. The cytoplasm of these
macrophages may contain rod-shaped inclusions called
histiocytosis-X bodies or Birbeck granules, best seen by
electron microscopy.
Clinically, unifocal eosinophilic granuloma is a benign
disorder. The bony lesion remains asymptomatic until the
erosion of the bone causes pain or fracture. Spontaneous
fibrosis or healing may occur in some cases, while others
may require curettage or radiotherapy.
Hand-Schüller-Christian Disease
A triad of features consisting of multifocal bony defects, diabetes
insipidus and exophthalmos is termed Hand-Schüller-Christian
disease. The disease develops in children under 5 years of
Figure 14.28

of lymph nodes. There are areas of necrosis in the circumscribed nodular
areas.

386

Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues
age. The multifocal lytic bony lesions may develop at any
site. Orbital lesion causes exophthalmos, while involvement
of the hypothalamus causes diabetes insipidus. Multiple
spherical lesions in the lungs are frequently present. Half
the patients have involvement of the liver, spleen and lymph
nodes.
Microscopically, the lesions are indistinguishable from
those of unifocal eosinophilic granuloma.
Clinically, the affected children frequently have fever,
skin lesions, recurrent pneumonitis and other infections.
Though the condition is benign, it is more disabling than the
unifocal eosinophilic granuloma. The lesions may resolve
spontaneously or may require chemotherapy or radiation.
Letterer-Siwe Disease
Letterer-Siwe disease is an acute disseminated form of LCH
occurring in infants and children under 2 years of age. The
disease is characterised by hepatosplenomegaly, lymph-
adenopathy, thrombocytopenia, anaemia and leucopenia.
There is generalised hyperplasia of tissue macrophages in
various organs.
Microscopically, the involved organs contain aggregates
of macrophages which are pleomorphic and show nuclear
atypia. The cytoplasm of these cells contains vacuoles and
rod-shaped histiocytosis-X bodies.
Clinically, the child has acute symptoms of fever, skin
rash, loss of weight, anaemia, bleeding disorders and
enlargement of lymph nodes, liver and spleen. Cystic bony
lesions may be apparent in the skull, pelvis and long bones.
Intense chemotherapy helps to control Letterer-Siwe disease
but intercurrent infections result in fatal outcome in many
cases. The condition is currently regarded as an unusual form
of malignant lymphoma.
SPLEEN
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The spleen is the largest lymphoid organ of the body. Under
normal conditions, the average weight of the spleen is about
150 gm in the adult. Normally, the organ lies well protected
by the 9th, 10th and 11th ribs in the upper left quadrant. The
surface of the spleen is covered by a layer of peritoneum
underneath which the organ is ensheathed by a thin capsule.
From the capsule extend connective tissue trabeculae into the
pulp of the organ and serve as supportive network. Blood
enters the spleen by the splenic artery which divides into
branches that penetrate the spleen via trabeculae. From the
trabeculae arise small branches called central arterioles. Blood
in the central arterioles empties partly into splenic venules
and from there into splenic vein, but largely into vascular
sinuses of the red pulp and thence into the splenic venous
system.
Grossly, the spleen consists of homogeneous, soft, dark red
mass called the red pulp and long oval grey-white nodules
called the white pulp (malpighian bodies).
Microscopically, the red pulp consists of a network of thin-
walled venous sinuses and adjacent blood spaces. The blood
spaces contain blood cells, lymphocytes and macrophages
and appear to be arranged in cords called splenic cords or
cords of Billroth. The white pulp is made up of lymphocytes
surrounding an eccentrically placed arteriole. The
periarteriolar lymphocytes are mainly T-cells, while at other
places the lymphocytes have a germinal centre composed
principally of B-cells surrounded by densely packed
lymphocytes.
The spleen is a lymphoreticular organ that performs at
least the following four functions:
1.
Like other lymphoid tissues, it is an organ of the immune
system where B and T lymphocytes multiply and help in
immune responses.
2.
The spleen plays an active role in sequestering and
removing normal and abnormal blood cells.
3.
The vasculature of the spleen plays a role in regulating
portal blood flow.
4.
Under pathologic conditions, the spleen may become the
site of extramedullary haematopoiesis.
The spleen is rarely the primary site of disease. Being the
largest lymphoreticular organ, it is involved secondarily in
a wide variety of systemic disorders which manifest most
commonly as splenic enlargement (splenomegaly) described
below. A few other systemic involvements such as splenic
infarcts and chronic venous congestion (CVC) of spleen have
already been considered in Chapter 5 of General Pathology.
SPLENOMEGALY
Enlargement of the spleen termed splenomegaly, occurs in a
wide variety of disorders which increase the cellularity and
vascularity of the organ. Many of the causes are exaggerated
Figure 14.29

granuloma. Bone biopsy shows presence of infiltrate by collections of
histiocytes having vesicular nuclei admixed with eosinophils.

387
CHAPTER 14
Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues
forms of normal splenic function. Splenic enlargement may
occur as a result of one of the following pathophysiologic
mechanisms:
I.
Infections
II. Disordered immunoregulation
III. Altered splenic blood flow
IV. Lymphohaematogenous malignancies
V. Diseases with abnormal erythrocytes
VI. Storage diseases
VII. Miscellaneous causes.
Based on these mechanisms, an abbreviated list of causes
of splenomegaly is given in Table 14.13. Most of these
conditions have been discussed elsewhere.
The degree of splenomegaly varies with the disease
entity:
Mild enlargement (upto 5 cm) occurs in CVC of spleen in
CHF, acute malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial endocarditis,
SLE, rheumatoid arthritis and thalassaemia minor.
Moderate enlargement (upto umbilicus) occurs in hepatitis,
cirrhosis, lymphomas, infectious mononucleosis, haemolytic
anaemia, splenic abscesses and amyloidosis.
Massive enlargement (below umbilicus) occurs in CML,
myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis, storage diseases,
thalassaemia major, chronic malaria, leishmaniasis and portal
vein obstruction.
Mild to moderate splenomegaly is usually symptomless,
while a massively enlarged spleen may cause dragging
sensation in the left hypochondrium. Spleen becomes
palpable only when it is enlarged.
Grossly, an enlarged spleen is heavy and firm. The capsule
is tense and thickened. The sectioned surface of the organ
is firm with prominent trabeculae.
Microscopically, there is dilatation of sinusoids with
prominence of splenic cords. The white pulp is atrophic
while the trabeculae are thickened. Long-standing
congestion may produce haemorrhages and Gamna-Gandy
bodies resulting in fibrocongestive splenomegaly, also called
Banti’s spleen ( see Figs. 5.13 and 5.14)
HYPERSPLENISM
The term hypersplenism is used for conditions which cause
excessive removal of erythrocytes, granulocytes or platelets
from the circulation. The mechanism for excessive removal
could be due to increased sequestration of cells in the spleen
by altered splenic blood flow or by production of antibodies
against respective blood cells. The criteria for hypersplenism
are as under:
1.
Splenomegaly.
2.
Splenic destruction of one or more of the cell types in the
peripheral blood causing anaemia, leucopenia, thrombo-
cytopenia, or pancytopenia.
3.
Bone marrow cellularity is normal or hyperplastic.
4.
Splenectomy is followed by improvement in the severity
of blood cytopenia.
EFFECTS OF SPLENECTOMY
In view of the prominent role of normal spleen in seques-
tration of blood cells, splenectomy in a normal individual
is followed by significant haematologic alterations.
Induction of similar haematologic effects is made use in the
treatment of certain pathologic conditions. For example, in
autoimmune haemolytic anaemia or thrombocytopenia, the
respective blood cell counts are increased following
splenectomy. The blood changes following splenectomy are
as under:
1.
Red cells: There is appearance of target cells in the blood
film. Howell-Jolly bodies are present in the red cells as they
are no longer cleared by the spleen. Osmotic fragility test
shows increased resistance to haemolysis. There may be
appearance of normoblasts.

2.
White cells: There is leucocytosis reaching its peak in 1-
2 days after splenectomy. There is shift-to-left of the myeloid
cells with appearance of some myelocytes.
3.
Platelets: Within hours after splenectomy, there is rise in
platelet count upto 3-4 times normal.
SPLENIC RUPTURE
The most common cause of splenic rupture or laceration is
blunt trauma. The trauma may be direct or indirect. Non-
traumatic or spontaneous rupture occurs in an enlarged
spleen but almost never in a normal spleen. In acute
infections, the spleen can enlarge rapidly to 2 to 3 times its
normal size causing acute splenic enlargement termed acute
splenic tumour e.g. in pneumonias, septicaemia, acute
endocarditis etc. Some of the other common causes of
spontaneous splenic rupture are splenomegaly due to chronic
malaria, infectious mononucleosis, typhoid fever, splenic
abscess, thalassaemia and leukaemias.
Rupture of spleen is an acute surgical emergency due to
rapid blood loss and haemoperitoneum. Sometimes
fragments of splenic tissue are autotransplanted within the
peritoneal cavity and grow into tiny spleens there (splenosis).
TUMOURS
Primary tumours of the spleen are extremely rare. The
only notable benign tumours are haemangiomas and
lymphangioma, while examples of primary malignant
neoplasms of haematopoietic system i.e. Hodgkin’s disease
and non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. Non-haematopoietic
tumours of the spleen such as angiosarcoma are rare.
Secondary tumours occur late in the course of disease
and represent haematogenous dissemination of the
malignant tumour. Splenic metastases appear as multiple
nodules. The most frequent primary sites include: lung,
breast, prostate, colon and stomach. Rarely, direct extension
from an adjacent malignant neoplasm may occur.
THYMUS
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The thymus gland is a complex lymphoreticular organ lying
buried within the mediastinum. At birth, the gland weighs
10-35 gm and grows in size upto puberty, following which
there is progressive involution in the elderly. In the adult,
thymus weighs 5-10 gm.
The gland consists of right and left encapsulated lobes,
joined together by fibrous connective tissue. Connective
tissue septa pass inwards from the capsule and subdivide
the lobe into large number of lobules. The histologic structure
of the lobule shows outer cortex and inner medulla. Both cortex
and medulla contain two types of cells: epithelial cells and
lymphocytes (thymocytes).
Epithelial cells are similar throughout the thymus gland.
These cells have elongated cytoplasmic processes forming
network in which thymocytes and macrophages are found.
Hassall’s corpuscles are distinctive structures within the
medulla composed of onion skin-like concentrically arranged
epithelial cells having central area of keratinisation.
Thymocytes are predominantly present in the cortex.
These cells include immature T lymphocytes in the cortex
and mature T lymphocytes in the medulla. Well-developed
B-cell lymphoid follicles with germinal centres are rare in
thymus gland.
The main function of the thymus is in the cell-mediated
immunity by T-cells and by secretion of thymic hormones
such as thymopoietin and thymosin-α1.
Thymic lesions are associated with diverse conditions
which may be immunologic, haematologic or neoplastic.
These can be broadly categorised into thymic hypoplasia and
agenesis, thymic hyperplasia and  thymoma, while thymic
involvement in myasthenia gravis is discussed in
Chapter 28.
THYMIC HYPOPLASIA AND AGENESIS
Thymic hypoplasia and agenesis are acquired and congenital
disorders respectively in which the gland is either unusually
small or absent. These conditions are various types of
hereditary (primary) immunodeficiency diseases such as
DiGeorge’s syndrome, severe combined immunodeficiency
and reticular dysgenesis. Acquired hypoplasia occurs as an
ageing phenomenon or may occur in the young due to severe
stress, malnutrition, irradiation, therapy with cytotoxic drugs
and glucocorticoids.
THYMIC HYPERPLASIA
Enlargement of the thymus or failure to involute produces
thymic hyperplasia. Hyperplasia is usually associated with
appearance of lymphoid follicles in the medulla of the thymus
and is called thymic follicular hyperplasia. Most common cause
of follicular hyperplasia of the thymus is myasthenia gravis.
Less common causes are: Addison’s disease, Graves’ disease,
rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, scleroderma and cirrhosis of liver.
THYMOMA
Most common primary tumour present in the anterosuperior
mediastinum is thymoma. Although thymus is a
lymphoepithelial organ, the term thymoma is used for the
tumour of epithelial origin. Most of the patients are adults.
In about half the cases, thymoma remains asymptomatic and
is accidentally discovered in X-rays. Other patients have
associated conditions like myasthenia gravis or local
symptoms such as cough, dyspnoea and chest pain.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
spherical, measuring 5-10 cm in diameter with an average
weight of 150 gm. Sectioned surface is soft, yellowish,
lobulated and may be either homogeneous or contain cysts
due to the presence of haemorrhage and necrosis.
Microscopically, the tumour has a thick fibrous capsule
from which extend collagenous septa into the tumour
dividing it into lobules. The histology of lobule shows

Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues
various patterns. The tumour consists of neoplastic
epithelial cells and variable number of non-neoplastic
lymphocytes. Thymoma may be of following types:
Benign thymoma is more common. It consists of epithelial
cells which are similar to the epithelial cells in the medulla
of thymus and hence also called as medullary thymoma.
Malignant thymoma is less common and is further of 2
types:
Type 1 is cytologically benign looking but aggressive and
invades the mediastinal structures locally.
Type 2 is also called thymic carcinoma and has cytologic
features of cancer. Further subtypes of epithelial
malignancy may be squamous cell type (most common)
and lymphoepithelial type.
 Thymomas are known for their association with
paraneoplastic syndrome. These include: myasthenia gravis
(most common), hypogammaglobulinaemia, erythroid
hypoplasia (pure red cell aplasia), peripheral T cell leukae-
mia/lymphoma, multiple myeloma, other autoimmune
disease associations and other systemic malignancies.

Section III
SYSTEMIC PATHOLOGY
The blood vessels are closed circuits for the transport of blood
from the left heart to the metabolising cells, and then back to
the right heart. The blood containing oxygen, nutrients and
metabolites is routed through arteries, arterioles, capillaries,
venules and veins. These blood vessels differ from each other
in their structure and function.
ARTERIES
NORMAL STRUCTURE
Depending upon the calibre and certain histologic features,
arteries are divided into 3 types: large (elastic) arteries,
medium-sized (muscular) arteries and the smallest arterioles.
Histologically, all the arteries of the body have 3 layers
in their walls: the tunica intima, the tunica media and the
tunica adventitia. These layers progressively decrease
with diminution in the size of the vessels.
1.
Tunica intima. This is the inner coat of the artery. It is
composed of the lining endothelium, subendothelial
connective tissue and bounded externally by internal elastic
lamina.
Endothelium is a layer of flattened cells adjacent to the
flowing blood. Narrow junctions exist between the adjoining
endothelial cells through which certain materials pass. The
integrity of the endothelial layer is of paramount importance
in maintenance of vascular functions since damage to it is
the most important event in the initiation of thrombus forma-
tion at the site.
Subendothelial tissue consists of loose meshwork of
connective tissue that includes myointimal cells, collagen,
proteoglycans, elastin and matrix glycoproteins.
Internal elastic lamina is a layer of elastic fibres having
minute fenestrations.
2.
Tunica media. Tunica media is the middle coat of the
arterial wall, bounded internally by internal elastic lamina
and externally by external elastic lamina. This layer is the
thickest and consists mainly of smooth muscle cells and
elastic fibres. The external elastic lamina consisting of
condensed elastic tissue is less well defined than the internal
elastic lamina.
3. Tunica adventitia. The outer coat of arteries is the tunica
adventitia. It consists of loose mesh of connective tissue and
some elastic fibres that merge with the adjacent tissues. This
layer is rich in lymphatics and autonomic nerve fibres.
The layers of arterial wall receive nutrition and oxygen
from 2 sources:
1.
Tunica intima and inner third of the media are nourished
by direct diffusion from the blood present in the lumen.
2.
Outer two-thirds of the media and the adventitia are
supplied by vasa vasora (i.e. vessels of vessels), the nutrient
vessels arising from the parent artery.
As the calibre of the artery decreases, the three layers
progressively diminish. Thus, there are structural variations
in the three types of arteries:
Large, elastic arteries such as the aorta, innominate,
common carotid, major pulmonary, and common iliac
arteries have very high content of elastic tissue in the media
and thick elastic laminae and hence the name.
Medium-sized, muscular arteries are the branches of elastic
arteries. All the three layers of arterial wall are thinner than
in the elastic arteries. The internal elastic lamina appears as
a single wavy line while the external elastic lamina is less
prominent. The media primarily consists of smooth muscle
cells and some elastic fibres (Fig. 15.1).
Arterioles are the smallest branches with internal diameter
20-100 μm. Structurally, they consist of the three layers as in
muscular arteries but are much thinner and cannot be
distinguished. The arterioles consist of a layer of endothelial
cells in the intima, one or two smooth muscle cells in the
media and small amount of collagen and elastic tissue
comprising the adventitia. The elastic laminae are virtually
lost.
Capillaries are about the size of an RBC (7-8 μm) and
have a layer of endothelium but no media. Blood from
capillaries returns to the heart via post-capillary venules and
thence into venules and then veins.
In the following pages, diseases of arteries are discussed
under 3 major headings: arteriosclerosis, arteritis (vasculitis)
and aneurysms. This is followed by brief account of diseases
of veins and lymphatics, while the vascular tumours are
described at the end of the chapter.

391
CHAPTER 15
The Blood Vessels and Lymphatics
ARTERIOSCLEROSIS
Arteriosclerosis is a general term used to include all condi-
tions with thickening and hardening of the arterial walls.
The following morphologic entities are included under
arteriosclerosis:
I.
Senile arteriosclerosis
II. Hypertensive arteriolosclerosis
III. Mönckeberg’s arteriosclerosis
(Medial calcific sclerosis)
IV. Atherosclerosis
The last-named, atherosclerosis, is the most common and
most important form of arteriosclerosis; if not specified, the
two terms are used interchangeably with each other.
SENILE ARTERIOSCLEROSIS
Senile arteriosclerosis is the thickening of media and intima
of the arteries seen due to aging. The changes are non-
selective and affect most of  the arteries. These are possibly
induced by stress and strain on vessel wall during life.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The changes are as under:
1.  Fibroelastosis: The intima and media are thickened due
to increase in elastic and collagen tissue.
2.  Elastic reduplication: The internal elastic lamina is split
or reduplicated so that two wavy layers are seen.
Eventually, the fibrotic changes result in age-related
elevation of systolic blood pressure.
HYPERTENSIVE ARTERIOLOSCLEROSIS
Hypertension is the term used to describe an elevation in
blood pressure. Pathology of 3 forms of hypertension—
systemic, pulmonary and portal, is discussed in detail with
diseases of the kidneys (Chapter 22), lungs (Chapter 17) and
liver (Chapter 21) respectively.
Arteriolosclerosis is the term used to describe 3 morpho-
logic forms of vascular disease affecting arterioles and small
muscular arteries. These are: hyaline arteriolosclerosis,
hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis and necrotising arteriolitis. All
the three types are common in hypertension but may occur
due to other causes as well.
Hyaline Arteriolosclerosis
Hyaline sclerosis is a common arteriolar lesion that may be
seen physiologically due to aging, or may occur pathologically
in benign nephrosclerosis in hypertensives and as a part of
microangiopathy in diabetics; the subject is discussed again
in Chapter 22.
MORPHOLOGIC CHANGES. The visceral arterioles are
particularly involved. The vascular walls are thickened
and the lumina narrowed or even obliterated.
Microscopically, the thickened vessel wall shows
structureless, eosinophilic, hyaline material in the intima
and media (Fig. 15.2,A).
PATHOGENESIS. The exact pathogenesis is not known.
However, the following hypotheses have been proposed:
i)
The lesions result most probably from leakage of compo-
nents of plasma across the vascular endothelium. This is
substantiated by the demonstration of immunoglobulins,
complement, fibrin and lipids in the lesions. The permeability
of the vessel wall is increased, due to haemodyanamic stress
in hypertension and metabolic stress in diabetes, so that these
plasma components leak out and get deposited in the vessel
wall.
ii) An alternate possibility is that the lesions may be due to
immunologic reaction.
iii) Some have considered it to be normal aging process that is
exaggerated in hypertension and diabetes mellitus.
Hyperplastic Arteriolosclerosis
The hyperplastic or proliferative type of arteriolosclerosis is
a characteristic lesion of malignant hypertension; other
causes include haemolytic-uraemic syndrome, scleroderma
and toxaemia of pregnancy.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The morphologic changes
affect mainly the intima, especially of the interlobular
arteries in the kidneys. Three types of intimal thickening
may occur.
i)
Onion-skin lesion consists of loosely-placed concentric
layers of hyperplastic intimal smooth muscle cells like the
bulb of an onion. The basement membrane is also
thickened and reduplicated (Fig. 15.2, B).
ii) Mucinous intimal thickening is the deposition of amor-
phous ground substance, probably proteoglycans, with
scanty cells.
iii) Fibrous intimal thickening is less common and consists
of bundles of collagen, elastic fibres and hyaline deposits
in the intima.
Severe intimal sclerosis results in narrowed or
obliterated lumen. With time, the lesions become more
and more fibrotic.

392
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
PATHOGENESIS. The pathogenesis of hyperplastic intimal
thickening is unclear. Probably, the changes result following
endothelial injury from systemic hypertension, hypoxia or
immunologic damage leading to increased permeability. A
healing reaction occurs in the form of proliferation of smooth
muscle cells with fibrosis.
Necrotising Arteriolitis
In cases of severe hypertension and malignant hypertension,
parts of small arteries and arterioles show changes of hyaline
sclerosis and parts of these show necrosis, or necrosis may
be superimposed on hyaline sclerosis. However, hyaline
sclerosis may not be always present in the vessel wall.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Besides the changes of
hyaline sclerosis, the changes of necrotising arteriolitis
include fibrinoid necrosis of vessel wall, acute
inflammatory infiltrate of neutrophils in the adventitia.
Oedema and haemorrhages often surround the affected
vessels (Fig. 15.2,C).
PATHOGENESIS. Since necrotising arteriolitis occurs in
vessels in which there is sudden and great elevation of
pressure, the changes are said to result from direct physical
injury to the vessel wall.
MÖNCKEBERG’S ARTERIOSCLEROSIS
(MEDIAL CALCIFIC SCLEROSIS)
Mönckeberg’s arteriosclerosis is calcification of the media of
large and medium-sized muscular arteries, especially of the
extremities and of the genital tract, in persons past the age
of 50. The condition occurs as an age-related degenerative
process, and therefore, an example of dystrophic calcification,
and has little or no clinical significance. However, medial
calcification also occurs in some pathological states like
pseudoxanthoma elasticum and in idiopathic arterial
calcification of infancy.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Medial calcification is
often an incidental finding in X-rays of the affected sites
having muscular arteries. The deposition of calcium salts
in the media produces pipestem-like rigid tubes without
causing narrowing of the lumen.
Microscopically, Mönckeberg’s arteriosclerosis is
characterised by deposits of calcium salts in the media
without associated inflammatory reaction while the intima
and the adventitia are spared (Fig. 15.3). Often, coexistent
changes of atherosclerosis are present altering the
histologic appearance.
PATHOGENESIS. Pathogenesis of this condition is not
known but it is considered as an age-related physiologic
change due to prolonged effect of vasoconstriction.

There is calcification exclusively in the tunica media unassociated with
any significant inflammation.

CHAPTER 15
The Blood Vessels and Lymphatics
ATHEROSCLEROSIS
Definition
Atherosclerosis is a specific form of arteriosclerosis affecting
primarily the intima of large and medium-sized muscular
arteries and is characterised by fibrofatty plaques or
atheromas. The term atherosclerosis is derived from athero-
(meaning porridge) referring to the soft lipid-rich material
in the centre of atheroma, and sclerosis (scarring) referring to
connective tissue in the plaques. Atherosclerosis is the
commonest and the most important of the arterial diseases.
Though any large and medium-sized artery may be involved
in atherosclerosis, the most commonly affected are the aorta,
the coronary and the cerebral arterial systems. Therefore, the
major clinical syndromes resulting from ischaemia due to
atherosclerosis pertain to the heart (angina and myocardial
infarcts or heart attacks), and the brain (transient cerebral
ischaemia and cerebral infarcts or strokes); other sequelae are
peripheral vascular disease, aneurysmal dilatation due to
weakened arterial wall, chronic ischaemic heart disease,
ischaemic encephalopathy and mesenteric arterial occlusion.
Etiology
Atherosclerosis is widely prevalent in industrialised coun-
tries. However, majority of the data on etiology are based
on the animal experimental work and epidemiological
studies. The incidences for atherosclerosis quoted in the
literature are based on the major clinical syndromes
produced by it, the most important interpretation being that
death from myocardial infarction is related to underlying
atherosclerosis. Cardiovascular disease, mostly related to
atherosclerotic coronary heart disease or ischaemic heart
disease (IHD) is the most common cause of premature death
in the developed countries of the world. It is estimated that
by the year 2020, cardiovascular disease, mainly
atherosclerosis, will become the leading cause of total global
disease burden.
Systematic large scale studies of investigations on living
populations have revealed a number of risk factors which are
associated with increased risk of developing clinical
atherosclerosis. Often, they are acting in combination rather
than singly. These risk factors are divided into two groups
(Table 15.1):
I.
Major risk factors. These are further considered under 2
headings:
A) Major risk factors modifiable by life style and/or therapy: This
includes major risk factors which can be controlled by
modifying life style and/or by pharmacotherapy and
includes: dyslipidaemias, hypertension, diabetes mellitus
and smoking.
B) Constitutional risk factors: These are non-modifiable major
risk factors that include: increasing age, male sex, genetic
abnormalities, and familial and racial predisposition.
II. Non-traditional emerging risk factors. This includes a
host of factors whose role in atherosclerosis is minimal, and
in some cases, even uncertain.
Apparently, a combination of etiologic risk factors have
additive effect in producing the lesions of atherosclerosis.
MAJOR RISK FACTORS MODIFIABLE BY LIFE STYLE
AND/OR THERAPY
There are four major risk factors in atherogenesis—lipid
disorders, hypertension, cigarette smoking and diabetes
mellitus.
1.
DYSLIPIDAEMIAS. Virchow in 19th century first
identified cholesterol crystals in the atherosclerotic lesions.
Since then, extensive information on lipoproteins and their
role in atherosclerotic lesions has been gathered.
Abnormalities in plasma lipoproteins have been firmly
established as the most important major risk factor for
atherosclerosis. It has been firmly established that hyper-
cholesterolaemia has directly proportionate relationship with
atherosclerosis and IHD. The following evidences are cited
in support of this:
i)
The atherosclerotic plaques contain cholesterol and
cholesterol esters, largely derived from the lipoproteins in
the blood.
ii) The lesions of atherosclerosis can be induced in
experimental animals by feeding them with diet rich in
cholesterol.
iii) Individuals with hypercholesterolaemia due to various
causes such as in diabetes mellitus, myxoedema, nephrotic
syndrome, von Gierke’s disease, xanthomatosis and familial
hypercholesterolaemia have increased risk of developing
atherosclerosis and IHD.
iv) Populations having hypercholesterolaemia have higher
mortality from IHD. Dietary regulation and administration
of cholesterol-lowering drugs have beneficial effect on
reducing the risk of IHD.
The concentration of total cholesterol in the serum reflects
the concentrations of different lipoproteins in the serum. The
lipoproteins are divided into classes according to the density
of solvent in which they remain suspended on centrifugation
at high speed. The major classes of lipoprotein particles are
chylomicrons, very-low density lipoproteins (VLDL), low-density
lipoproteins (LDL), and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Lipids
are insoluble in blood and therefore are carried in circulation
and across the cell membrane by carrier proteins called
apoproteins. Apoprotein surrounds the lipid for carrying it,

different apoproteins being named by letter A, B, C, D etc
while their subfractions are numbered serially.
The major fractions of lipoproteins tested in blood lipid
profile and their varying effects on atherosclerosis and IHD
are as under (Table 15.2):
i) Total cholesterol: Desirable normal serum level is
140-200 mg/dl, while levels of borderline high are considered
between 200-240 mg/dl. An elevation of total serum
cholesterol levels above 260 mg/dl in men and women
between 30 and 50 years of age has three times higher risk of
developing IHD as compared with people with total serum
cholesterol levels within normal limits.
ii) Triglycerides: Normal serum level is below 160 mg/dl.
iii) Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol: Normal
optimal serum level is <130 mg/dl. LDL is richest in
cholesterol and has the maximum association with athero-
sclerosis.
iv) Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL): VLDL carries
much of the triglycerides and its blood levels therefore
parallel with that of triglycerides; VLDL has less marked effect
than LDL.
v) High-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol: Normal
desirable serum level is <60 mg/dl. HDL is protective (‘good
cholesterol’) against atherosclerosis.
Many studies have demonstrated the harmful effect of
diet containing larger quantities of saturated fats (e.g. in eggs,
meat, milk, butter etc) and trans fats (i.e. unsaturated fats
produced by artificial hydrogenation of polyunsaturated fats)
which raise the plasma cholesterol level. This type of diet is
consumed more often by the affluent societies who are at
greater risk of developing atherosclerosis. On the contrary,
a diet low in saturated fats and high in poly-unsaturated fats
and having omega-3 fatty acids (e.g. in fish, fish oils etc)
lowers the plasma cholesterol levels. Aside from lipid-rich
diet, high intake of the total number of calories from
carbohydrates, proteins, alcohol and sweets has adverse
effects.
Besides above, familial hypercholesterolaemia, an autosomal
codominant disorder, is characterised by elevated LDL
cholesterol and normal triglycerides and occurrence of
xanthomas and premature coronary artery disease. It occurs
due to mutations in LDL receptor gene.
Currently, management of dyslipidaemia is directed at
lowering LDL in particular and total cholesterol in general by
use of statins, and for raising HDL by weight loss, exercise
and use of nicotinic acid. Thus presently, preferred term for
hyperlipidaemia is dyslipidaemia because one risky plasma
lipoprotein (i.e. LDL) is elevated and needs to be brought
down, while the other good plasma lipoprotein (i.e. HDL)
when low requires to be raised.
How hypercholesterolaemia and various classes of
lipoproteins produce atherosclerosis is described under
‘pathogenesis’.
2.
HYPERTENSION. Hypertension is a risk factor for all
clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis. Hypertension
doubles the risk of all forms of cardiovascular disease. It acts
probably by mechanical injury to the arterial wall due to
increased blood pressure. Elevation of systolic pressure of
over 160 mmHg or a diastolic pressure of over 95 mmHg is
associated with five times higher risk of developing IHD than
in people with blood pressure within normal range (140/90
mmHg or less).
3.
SMOKING. The extent and severity of atherosclerosis
are much greater in smokers than in non-smokers. Cigarette
smoking is associated with higher risk of atherosclerotic IHD
and sudden cardiac death. Men who smoke a pack of
cigarettes a day are 3-5 times more likely to die of IHD than
non-smokers. The increased risk and severity of
atherosclerosis in smokers is due to reduced level of HDL,
deranged coagulation system and accumulation of carbon
monoxide in the blood that produces carboxyhaemoglobin
and eventually hypoxia in the arterial wall favouring
atherosclerosis.
4.
DIABETES MELLITUS. Clinical manifestations of
atherosclerosis are far more common and develop at an early
age in people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
In particular, association of type 2 diabetes mellitus
characterised by metabolic (insulin resistance) syndrome and
abnormal lipid profile  termed ‘diabetic dyslipidaemia’ is
common and heightens the risk of cardiovascular disease.
The risk of developing IHD is doubled, tendency to develop
cerebrovascular disease is high, and frequency to develop
gangrene of foot is about 100 times increased. The causes of
increased severity of atherosclerosis are complex and
numerous which include endothelial dysfunction, increased
aggregation of platelets, increased LDL and decreased HDL.
CONSTITUTIONAL RISK FACTORS
Age, sex and genetic influences do affect the appearance of
lesions of atherosclerosis.
1.
AGE. Atherosclerosis is an age-related disease. Though
early lesions of atherosclerosis may be present in childhood,
clinically significant lesions are found with increasing age.
Fully-developed atheromatous plaques usually appear in the

4th decade and beyond. Evidence in support comes from the
high death rate from IHD in this age group.
2.
SEX. The incidence and severity of atherosclerosis are
more in men than in women and the changes appear a decade
earlier in men (>45 years) than in women (>55 years). The
prevalence of atherosclerotic IHD is about three times higher
in men in 4th decade than in women and the difference slowly
declines with age but remains higher at all ages in men. The
lower incidence of IHD in women, especially in
premenopausal age, is probably due to high levels of
oestrogen and high-density lipoproteins, both of which have
anti-atherogenic influence.
3.
GENETIC FACTORS. Genetic factors play a significant
role in atherogenesis. Hereditary genetic derangements of
lipoprotein metabolism predispose the individual to high
blood lipid level and familial hypercholesterolaemia.
4.
FAMILIAL AND RACIAL FACTORS: The familial
predisposition to atherosclerosis may be related to other risk
factors like diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipopro-
teinaemia. Racial differences too exist; Blacks have generally
less severe atherosclerosis than Whites.
EMERGING RISK FACTORS
There are a number of nontraditional newly emerging risk
factors for which the role in the etiology of atherosclerosis is
yet not fully supported. These factors are as under:
1.
Higher incidence of atherosclerosis in developed
countries and low prevalence in underdeveloped countries,
suggesting the role of environmental influences.
2.
Obesity, if the person is overweight by 20% or more, is
associated with increased risk.
3.
Use of exogenous hormones (e.g. oral contraceptives) by
women or endogenous oestrogen deficiency (e.g. in post-
menopausal women) has been shown to have an increased
risk of developing myocardial infarction or stroke.
4. Physical inactivity and lack of exercise are associated with
the risk of developing atherosclerosis and its complications.
5. Stressful life style, termed as ‘type A’ behaviour pattern,
characterised by aggressiveness, competitive drive,
ambitiousness and a sense of urgency, is associated with
enhanced risk of IHD compared with ‘type B’ behaviour of
relaxed and happy-go-lucky type.
6. Patients with homocystinuria, an uncommon inborn error
of metabolism, have been reported to have early
atherosclerosis and coronay artery disease.
7.  There are some reports which suggest that moderate
consumption of alcohol has slightly beneficial effect by raising
the level of HDL cholesterol.
8. Prothrombotic factors and elevated fibrinogen levels favour
formation of thrombi which is the gravest complication of
atherosclerosis.
9. Role of infections, particularly of Chlamydia pneumoniae and
viruses such as herpesvirus and cytomegalovirus, has been
found in coronary atherosclerotic lesions by causing
inflammation. Possibly, infections may be acting in
combination with some other factors.
10. Markers of inflammation such as elevated C reactive protein,
an acute phase reactant, correlate with risk of  developing
atherosclerosis.
Pathogenesis
As stated above, atherosclerosis is not caused by a single
etiologic factor but is a multifactorial process whose exact
pathogenesis is still not known. Since the times of Virchow,
a number of theories have been proposed.
Insudation hypothesis. The concept hypothesised by
Virchow in 1856 that atherosclerosis is a form of cellular
proliferation of the intimal cells resulting from increased
imbibing of lipids from the blood came to be called the ‘lipid
theory’. Modified form of this theory is currently known as
‘response to injury hypothesis’ and is now-a-days the most
widely accepted theory.
Encrustation hypothesis. The proposal put forth by
Rokitansky in 1852 that atheroma represented a form of
encrustation on the arterial wall from the components in the
blood forming thrombi composed of platelets, fibrin and
leucocytes, was named as ‘encrustation theory’ or ‘thrombogenic
theory’. Since currently it is believed that encrustation or
thrombosis is not the sole factor in atherogenesis but the
components of thrombus (platelets, fibrin and leucocytes)
have a role in atheromatous lesions, this theory has now been
incorporated into the response-to-injury hypothesis
mentioned above.
Though, there is no consensus regarding the origin and
progression of lesion of atherosclerosis, the role of four key
factors—arterial smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, blood
monocytes and dyslipidaemia, is accepted by all. However,
the areas of disagreement exist in the mechanism and
sequence of events involving these factors in initiation,
progression and complications of disease. Currently,
pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is explained on the basis of
the following two theories:
1.
Reaction-to-injury hypothesis, first described in 1973, and
modified in 1986 and 1993 by Ross.
2.
Monoclonal theory, based on neoplastic proliferation of
smooth muscle cells, postulated by Benditt and Benditt in
1973.
1.
REACTION-TO-INJURY HYPOTHESIS. This theory is
most widely accepted and incorporates aspects of two older
historical theories of atherosclerosis—the lipid theory of
Virchow and thrombogenic (encrustation) theory of
Rokitansky.
The original response to injury theory was first described
in 1973 according to which the initial event in atherogenesis
was considered to be endothelial injury followed by smooth
muscle cell proliferation so that the early lesions, according
to this theory, consist of smooth muscle cells mainly.
The modified response-to-injury hypothesis described sub-
sequently in 1993 implicates lipoprotein entry into the
intima as the initial event followed by lipid accumulation in
the macrophages (foam cells now) which according to
modified theory, are believed to be the dominant cells in early
lesions.

396
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Both these theories—original and modified, have attra-
cted support and criticism. However, following is the
generally accepted role of key components involved in
atherogenesis, diagrammatically illustrated in Fig. 15.4.
i)
Endothelial injury. It has been known for many years
that endothelial injury is the initial triggering event in the
development of lesions of atherosclerosis. Actual endothelial
denudation is not an essential requirement, but endothelial
dysfunction may initiate the sequence of events. Numerous
causes ascribed to endothelial injury in experimental animals
are: mechanical trauma, haemodynamic forces, immuno-
logical and chemical mechanisms, metabolic agent as chronic
dyslipidaemia, homocystine, circulating toxins from systemic
infections, viruses, hypoxia, radiation, carbon monoxide and
tobacco products.
In man, two of the major risk factors which act together
to produce endothelial injury are: haemodynamic stress from
hypertension and chronic dyslipidaemia. The role of
haemodynamic forces in causing endothelial injury is further
supported by the distribution of atheromatous plaques at
points of bifurcation or branching of blood vessels which are
under greatest shear stress.
ii) Intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation. Endothelial
injury causes adherence, aggregation and platelet release
reaction at the site of exposed subendothelial connective
tissue and infiltration by inflammatory cells. Proliferation of
intimal smooth muscle cell and production of extracellular
matrix are stimulated by various cytokines such as IL-1 and
TNF-α released from invading monocyte-macrophages and
by activated platelets at the site of endothelial injury. These
cytokines lead to local synthesis of following growth factors
having distinct roles in plaque evolution:
Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast
growth factor (FGF) stimulate proliferation and migration
of smooth muscle cells from their usual location in the media
into the intima.
Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)  and interferon-
(IFN-γ) derived from activated T lymphocytes within lesions
regulate the synthesis of collagen by smooth muscle cells.
Smooth muscle cell proliferation is also facilitated by
biomolecules such as nitric oxide and endothelin released from
endothelial cells. Intimal proliferation of smooth muscle cells
is accompanied by synthesis of matrix proteins—collagen,
elastic fibre proteins and proteoglycans.
iii) Role of blood monocytes. Though blood monocytes do
not possess receptors for normal LDL, LDL does appear in
the monocyte cytoplasm to form foam cell by mechanism
illustrated in Fig. 15.5. Plasma LDL on entry into the intima
undergoes oxidation. The ‘oxidised LDL’ formed in the
intima performs the following all-important functions on
monocytes and endothelium:
For monocytes: Oxidised LDL acts to attract, proliferate,
immobilise and activate them as well as is readily taken up
by scavenger receptor on the monocyte to transform it to a
lipid-laden foam cell.
For endothelium: Oxidised LDL is cytotoxic.
Death of foam cell by apoptosis releases lipid to form
lipid core of plaque.
iv) Role of dyslipidaemia. As stated already, chronic
dyslipidaemia in itself may initiate endothelial injury and
dysfunction by causing increased permeability. In particular,
hypercholesterolaemia with increased serum concentration
of LDL promotes formation of foam cells, while high serum
concentration of HDL has anti-atherogenic effect.
v) Thrombosis. As apparent from the foregoing, endothelial
injury exposes subendothelial connective tissue resulting in
formation of small platelet aggregates at the site and causing
proliferation of smooth muscle cells. This causes mild
inflammatory reaction which together with foam cells is
incorporated into the atheromatous plaque. The lesions
enlarge by attaching fibrin and cells from the blood so that
thrombus becomes a part of atheromatous plaque.

MONOCLONAL HYPOTHESIS. This hypothesis is
based on the postulate that proliferation of smooth muscle
cells is the primary event and that this proliferation is
monoclonal in origin similar to cellular proliferation in
neoplasms (e.g. in uterine leiomyoma, Chapter 8). The
evidence cited in support of monoclonal hypothesis is the
observation on proliferated smooth muscle cells in
atheromatous plaques which have only one of the two forms
of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) isoenzymes,
suggesting monoclonality in origin. The monoclonal
proliferation of smooth muscle cells in atherosclerosis may
be initiated by mutation caused by exogenous chemicals (e.g.
cigarette smoke), endogenous metabolites (e.g. lipoproteins)
and some viruses (e.g. Marek’s disease virus in chickens,
herpesvirus).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES
Early lesions in the form of diffuse intimal thickening, fatty
streaks and gelatinous lesions are often the forerunners
in the evolution of atherosclerotic lesions.  However, the
clinical disease states due to luminal narrowing in
atherosclerosis are caused by fully developed atheroma-
tous plaques and complicated plaques (Fig. 15.6).
1.
FATTY STREAKS AND DOTS. Fatty streaks and
dots on the intima by themselves are harmless but may
be the precursor lesions of atheromatous plaques. They
are seen in all races of the world and begin to appear in
the first year of life. However, they are uncommon in older
persons and are probably absorbed. They are especially
prominent in the aorta and other major arteries, more often
on the posterior wall than the anterior wall.

Mechanism of foam cell formation.
Figure 15.6
Schematic evolution of lesions in atherosclerosis.

398
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Grossly, the lesions may appear as flat or slightly elevated
and yellow. They may be either in the form of small,
multiple dots, about 1 mm in size, or in the form of
elongated, beaded streaks.
Microscopically, fatty streaks lying under the endo-
thelium are composed of closely-packed foam cells, lipid-
containing elongated smooth muscle cells and a few
lymphoid cells. Small amount of extracellular lipid,
collagen and proteoglycans are also present.
2.
GELATINOUS LESIONS. Gelatinous lesions develop
in the intima of the aorta and other major arteries in the
first few months of life. Like fatty streaks, they may also
be precursors of plaques. They are round or oval,
circumscribed grey elevations, about 1 cm in diameter.
Microscopically, gelatinous lesions are foci of increased
ground substance in the intima with thinned overlying
endothelium.
3.
ATHEROMATOUS PLAQUES. A fully developed
atherosclerotic lesion is called atheromatous plaque, also
called fibrous plaque, fibrofatty plaque or atheroma. Unlike
fatty streaks, atheromatous plaques are selective in
different geographic locations and races and are seen in
advanced age. These lesions may develop from
progression of early lesions of the atherosclerosis
described above. Most often and most severely affected is the
abdominal aorta, though smaller lesions may be seen in
descending thoracic aorta and aortic arch. The major
branches of the aorta around the ostia are often severely
involved, especially the iliac, femoral, carotid, coronary,
and cerebral arteries.
Grossly, atheromatous plaques are white to yellowish-
white lesions, varying in diameter from 1-2 cm and raised
on the surface by a few millimetres to a centimetre in
thickness (Fig. 15.7). Cut section of the plaque reveals the
luminal surface as a firm, white fibrous cap and a central
core composed of yellow to yellow-white, soft, porridge-
like material and hence the name atheroma.
Microscopically, the appearance of plaque varies depen-
ding upon the age of the lesion. However, the following
features are invariably present (Fig. 15.8):
Superficial luminal part of the fibrous cap is covered
by endothelium, and is composed of smooth muscle cells,
dense connective tissue and extracellular matrix
containing proteoglycans and collagen.
Cellular area under the fibrous cap is comprised by a
mixture of macrophages, foam cells, lymphocytes and a
few smooth muscle cells which may contain lipid.
Deeper central soft core consists of extracellular lipid
material, cholesterol clefts, fibrin, necrotic debris and lipid-
laden foam cells.
In older and more advanced lesions, the collagen in the
fibrous cap may be dense and hyalinised, smooth muscle
cells may be atrophic and foam cells are fewer.
4.
COMPLICATED PLAQUES. Various pathologic chan-
ges that occur in fully-developed atheromatous plaques are
called the complicated lesions. These account for the most
serious harmful effects of atherosclerosis and even death.
These changes include calcification, ulceration, thrombosis,
haemorrhage and aneurysmal dilatation. It is not
uncommon to see more than one form of complication in a
plaque.
Figure 15.7
Structure of a fully-developed atheroma. The opened
up inner surface of the abdominal aorta shows a variety of atheromatous
lesions. While some are raised yellowish-white lesions raised above the
surface, a few have ulcerated surface. Orifices of some of the branches
coming out of the wall are narrowed by the atherosclerotic process.

399
CHAPTER 15
The Blood Vessels and Lymphatics
i)
Calcification. Calcification occurs more commonly in
advanced atheromatous plaques, especially in the aorta
and coronaries. The diseased intima cracks like an egg-
shell when the vessel is incised and opened.
Microscopically, the calcium salts are deposited in the
vicinity of necrotic area and in the soft lipid pool deep in
the thickened intima (Fig. 15.9). This form of athero-
sclerotic intimal calcification differs from Mönckeberg’s
medial calcific arteriosclerosis that affects only the tunica
media (page 392).
ii) Ulceration. The layers covering the soft pultaceous
material of an atheroma may ulcerate as a result of
haemodynamic forces or mechanical trauma. This results
in discharge of emboli composed of lipid material and
debris into the blood stream, leaving a shallow, ragged
ulcer with yellow lipid debris in the base of the ulcer.
Occasionally, atheromatous plaque in a coronary artery
may suddenly rupture into the arterial lumen forcibly and
cause thromboembolic occlusion.
iii) Thrombosis. The ulcerated plaque and the areas of
endothelial damage are vulnerable sites for formation of
superimposed thrombi. These thrombi may get dislodged
to become emboli and lodge elsewhere in the circulation,
or may get organised and incorporated into the arterial
wall as mural thrombi. Mural thrombi may become
occlusive thrombi which may subsequently recanalise.
iv) Haemorrhage. Intimal haemorrhage may occur in an
atheromatous plaque either from the blood in the vascular
lumen through an ulcerated plaque, or from rupture of
thin-walled capillaries that vascularise the atheroma from
adventitial vasa vasorum. Haemorrhage is particularly a
common complication in coronary arteries. The
haematoma formed at the site contains numerous
haemosiderin-laden macrophages.
v) Aneurysm formation. Though atherosclerosis is
primarily an intimal disease, advanced lesions are
associated with secondary changes in the media and
adventitia. The changes in media include atrophy and
thinning of the media and fragmentation of internal elastic
lamina. The adventitia undergoes fibrosis and some
inflammatory changes. These changes cause weakening
in the arterial wall resulting in aneurysmal dilatation.
Clinical Effects
The clinical effects of atherosclerosis depend upon the size
and type of arteries affected. In general, the clinical effects
result from the following:
1.
Slow luminal narrowing causing ischaemia and atrophy.
2.
Sudden luminal occlusion causing infarction necrosis.

Formation of aneurysmal dilatation and eventual rupture.
Large arteries affected most often are the aorta, renal,
mesenteric and carotids, whereas the medium- and small-
sized arteries frequently involved are the coronaries,
cerebrals and arteries of the lower limbs. Accordingly, the
symptomatic atherosclerotic disease involves most often the
heart, brain, kidneys, small intestine and lower extremities
(Fig. 15.10). The effects pertaining to these organs are
described in relevant chapters later while the major effects
are listed below (Fig. 15.11):
i)
Aorta—Aneurysm formation, thrombosis and
embolisation to other organs.
ii) Heart—Myocardial infarction, ischaemic heart disease.
iii) Brain—Chronic ischaemic brain damage, cerebral
infarction.
iv) Small intestine—Ischaemic bowel disease, infarction.
v) Lower extremities—Intermittent claudication, gangrene.
ARTERITIS
Arteritis, angiitis and vasculitis are the common terms used
for inflammatory process in an artery or an arteriole. It may
occur following invasion of the vessel by infectious agents,
or may be induced by non-infectious injuries such as
chemical, mechanical, immunologic and radiation injury. The
non-infectious group is more important than the infectious
type. A classification of arteritis based on this is given in
Table 15.3.
I.
INFECTIOUS ARTERITIS
Direct invasion of the artery by infectious agents, especially
bacteria and fungi, causes infectious arteritis. It may be found
in the vicinity of an infected focus like in tuberculosis,
pneumonia, abscesses, etc. or less frequently may arise from
haematogenous spread of infection such as in infective
endocarditis, septicaemia, etc. Some common types are
described below.
Endarteritis Obliterans
Endarteritis obliterans is not a disease entity but a patho-
logic designation used for non-specific inflammatory
response of arteries and arterioles to a variety of irritants. It
is commonly seen close to the lesions of peptic ulcers of the
stomach and duodenum, tuberculous and chronic abscesses
in the lungs, chronic cutaneous ulcers, chronic meningitis,
and in post-partum and post-menopausal uterine arteries.
Grossly, the affected vessels may appear unaltered
externally but on cross-section show obliteration of their
lumina.
Microscopically, the obliteration of the lumen is due to
concentric and symmetric proliferation of cellular fibrous
tissue in the intima. Though the condition has suffix—itis

The Blood Vessels and Lymphatics
attached to it, there is minimal or no inflammatory cell
infiltrate.
Non-syphilitic Infective Arteritis
Various forms of invasions of the artery by bacteria, fungi,
parasites or viruses, either directly or by haematogenous
route, cause non-syphilitic infective arteritis.
Microscopically, the inflammatory infiltrate is present in
the vessel wall. The vascular lumen may get occluded by
thrombi and result in ischaemic necrosis of the affected
tissue.
Syphilitic Arteritis
Syphilitic or luetic vascular involvement occurs in all stages
of syphilis but is more prominent in the tertiary stage. The
changes that are found in the syphilitic arteritis are seen
within the arterial tissue (syphilitic endarteritis) and in the
periarterial tissues (syphilitic periarteritis). Manifestations of
the disease are particularly prominent at two sites—the aorta
and the cerebral arteries.
SYPHILITIC AORTITIS. Syphilitic involvement of the
ascending aorta and the aortic arch is the commonest
manifestation of cardiovascular syphilis. It occurs in about
80% cases of tertiary syphilis. Preferential involvement of
the arch of aorta may be due to involvement of mediastinal
lymph nodes in secondary syphilis through which the
treponemes spread to the lymphatics around the aortic arch.
The lesions diminish in severity in descending thoracic aorta
and disappear completely at the level of the diaphragm.
Grossly, the affected part of the aorta may be dilated, and
its wall somewhat thickened and adherent to the
neighbouring mediastinal structures. Longitudinally
opened vessels show intimal surface studded with pearly-
white thickenings, varying from a few millimeters to a
centimeter in diameter. These lesions are separated by
wrinkled normal intima, giving it characteristic tree-bark
appearance. Cut section of the lesion shows more firm and
fibrous appearance than the atheromatous plaques.
However, superimposed atherosclerotic lesions may be
present.
Microscopically, the conspicuous features are as under
(Fig. 15.12):
Endarteritis and periarteritis of the vasa vasorum
located in the media and adventitia.
Perivascular accumulation of plasma cells, lympho-
cytes and macrophages that may form miliary gummas
which undergo necrosis and are replaced by scar tissue.
Intimal thickenings consist of dense avascular collagen
that may undergo hyalinisation and calcification.
The effects of syphilitic aortitis may vary from trivial to
catastrophic. These are as follows:
a) Aortic aneurysm may result from damage to the aortic wall
(page 406).
b) Aortic valvular incompetence used to be considered an
important sequela of syphilis but now-a-days rheumatic
disease is considered more important cause for this. The
aortic incompetence results from spread of the syphilitic
process to the aortic valve ring.
c) Stenosis of coronary ostia is seen in about 20% cases of
syphilitic aortitis and may lead to progressive myocardial
fibrosis, angina pectoris and sudden death.
The features distinguishing syphilitic aortitis from aortic
atheroma are given in Table 15.4.
CEREBRAL SYPHILITIC ARTERITIS (HEUBNER’S
ARTERITIS). Syphilitic involvement of small and medium-
sized cerebral arteries occurs during the tertiary syphilis. The
changes may accompany syphilitic meningitis.
Grossly, the cerebral vessels are white, rigid and thick-
walled.
Microscopically, changes of endarteritis and periarteritis
similar to those seen in syphilitic aortitis are found. There
is atrophy of muscle in the media and replacement by
fibrosis. This results in ischaemic atrophy of the brain.

Systemic Pathology
liver, gastrointestinal tract, muscle, pancreas, testes, nervous
system and skin. The syndrome of PAN presents with varied
symptoms pertaining to different organs. However, some
usual clinical features are fever, malaise, weakness, weight
loss, renal manifestations (albuminuria, haematuria and renal
failure), vascular lesions in the alimentary tract (abdominal
pain and melaena), peripheral neuritis and hypertension. The
condition is believed to result from deposition of immune
complexes and tumour-related antigens.
Grossly, the lesions of PAN involve segments of vessels,
especially at the bifurcations and branchings, as tiny
beaded nodules.
Microscopically, there are 3 sequential stages in the
evolution of lesions in PAN:
i)
Acute stage—There is fibrinoid necrosis in the centre
of the nodule located in the media. An acute inflammatory
response develops around the focus of fibrinoid necrosis.
The inflammatory infiltrate is present in the entire
circumference of the affected vessel (periarteritis) and
consists chiefly of neutrophils and eosinophils, and some
mononuclear cells. The lumen may show thrombi and the
weakened wall may be the site of aneurysm formation.
ii) Healing stage—This is characterised by marked
fibroblastic proliferation producing firm nodularity. The
inflammatory infiltrate now consists mainly of
lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages.
iii) Healed stage—In this stage, the affected arterial wall is
markedly thickened due to dense fibrosis. The internal
elastic lamina is fragmented or lost. Healed stage may
contain haemosiderin-laden macrophages and organised
thrombus.
However, it may be mentioned here that various stages
of the disease may be seen in different vessels and even
within the same vessel.
Hypersensitivity Vasculitis
Hypersensitivity vasculitis, also called as allergic or leuco-
cytoclastic vasculitis or microscopic polyarteritis, is a group
of clinical syndromes differing from PAN in having
inflammatory involvement of venules, capillaries and
arterioles. The tissues and organs most commonly involved
are the skin, mucous membranes, lungs, brain, heart,
II. NON-INFECTIOUS ARTERITIS
This group consists of most of the important forms of
vasculitis, more often affecting  arterioles, venules and
capillaries, and hence also termed as small vessel vasculitis.
Their exact etiology is not known but available evidence
suggests that many of them have immunologic origin. Serum
from many of patients with vasculitis of immunologic origin
show the presence of following immunologic features:
1. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs).
Patients with immunologic vasculitis have autoantibodies
in their serum against the cytoplasmic antigens of the
neutrophils, macrophages and endothelial cells; these are
called ANCAs.  Neutrophil immunofluorescence is used to
demonstrate their presence, of which two distinct patterns
of ANCAs are seen:
Cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) pattern is specific for
proteinase-3 (PR-3), a constituent of neutrophilic granules;
this is seen in cases with active Wegener’s granulomatosis.
Perinuclear ANCA (p-ANCA) pattern is specific for
myeloperoxidase enzyme; this is noted in patients with
microscopic polyarteritis nodosa and primary glomerular
disease.
2. Anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECAs). These
antibodies are demonstable in cases of SLE, Kawasaki disease
and Buerger’s disease.
3. Pauci-immune vasculitis. While most cases of
immunologic vasculitis have immune complex deposits in
the vessel wall, there are some cases which do not have such
immune deposits and are termed as cases of pauci-immune
vasculitis (similar to pauci-immune glomerulonephritis,
Chapter 22). Pathogenesis of lesions in these cases is
explained by other mechanisms.
Polyarteritis Nodosa
Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a necrotising vasculitis invol-
ving small and medium-sized muscular arteries of multiple
organs and tissues. ‘Polyarteritis’ is the preferred
nomenclature over ‘periarteritis’ because inflammatory
involvement occurs in all the layers of the vessel wall.
The disease occurs more commonly in adult males than
females. Most commonly affected organs, in descending
order of frequency of involvement, are the kidneys, heart,

The Blood Vessels and Lymphatics
gastrointestinal tract, kidneys and muscle. The condition
results from immunologic response to an identifiable antigen
that may be bacteria (e.g. streptococci, staphylococci,
mycobacteria), viruses (e.g. hepatitis B virus, influenza virus,
CMV), malarial parasite, certain drugs and chemicals.
Hypersensitivity vasculitis includes clinicopathologic entities
such as serum sickness, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, mixed
cryoglobulinaemia, vasculitis associated with malignancy,
and vasculitis associated with connective tissue diseases like
rheumatoid arthritis and SLE.
Microscopically, the lesions characteristically involve
smallest vessels, sparing medium-sized and larger
arteries. Two histologic forms are described:
i)
Leucocytoclastic vasculitis, characterised by fibrinoid
necrosis with neutrophilic infiltrate in the vessel wall.
Many of the neutrophils are fragmented (Fig. 15.13). This
form is found in vasculitis caused by deposits of immune
complexes.
ii) Lymphocytic vasculitis, in which the involved vessel
shows predominant infiltration by lymphocytes. This type
is seen in vascular injury due to delayed hypersensitivity
or cellular immune reactions.
Wegener’s Granulomatosis
Wegener’s granulomatosis is another form of necrotising
vasculitis characterised by a clinicopathologic triad consisting
of the following:
i)
Acute necrotising granulomas of the upper and lower
respiratory tracts involving nose, sinuses and lungs;
ii) focal necrotising vasculitis, particularly of the lungs and
upper airways; and
iii) focal or diffuse necrotising glomerulonephritis.
A limited form of Wegener’s granulomatosis is the same
condition without renal involvement. As with PAN, the
condition is more common in adult males and involves
multiple organs and tissues. Most commonly involved
organs are the lungs, paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx and
kidneys. Other involved organs are joints, skin, eyes, ears,
heart and nervous system. Accordingly, clinical features are
variable. Typical features include pneumonitis with bilateral
infiltrates in the lungs (Chapter 17), chronic sinusitis, naso-
pharyngeal ulcerations (Chapter 18) and renal disease
(Chapter 22). The etiology is not known but possibly the
lesions occur due to the presence of circulating immune
complexes. This is supported by the observation of
subepithelial immunoglobulin deposits on the glomerular
basement membrane and induction of remission by immuno-
suppressive therapy. The serum of these patients shows
c-ANCA positivity. Disseminated form of Wegener’s
granulomatosis differs from a related entity, idiopathic lethal
midline granuloma, in the sense that the latter condition is
highly destructive and progressively necrotic disease of the
upper airways.
Histologically, the characteristic feature of Wegener’s
granulomatosis is the presence of necrotising granulo-
matous inflammation of the tissues and necrotising
vasculitis with or without granulomas:
The granulomas consist of fibrinoid necrosis with
extensive infiltration by neutrophils, mononuclear cells,
epithelioid cells, multinucleate giant cells and fibroblastic
proliferation.
The necrotising vasculitis may be segmental or circum-
ferential.
The renal lesions are those of focal or diffuse necro-
tising glomerulonephritis.
Temporal (Giant Cell) Arteritis
This is a form of granulomatous inflammation of medium-
sized and large arteries. Preferential sites of involvement are
the cranial arteries, especially the temporal, and hence the
name. However, the aorta and other major arteries like
common carotid, axillary, brachial, femoral and mesenteric
arteries are also involved, and therefore, it is preferable to
call the entity as ‘giant cell arteritis’. The patients are generally
over the age of 70 years with slight female preponderance.
The usual clinical manifestations are headache and blindness
if ophthalmic artery is involved. An association with
polymyalgia rheumatica has been observed. The cause of the
condition remains unknown though there is suggestion of T
cell mediated immunologic reaction to some component of
the arterial wall, especially against the damaged internal
elastic lamina. Biopsy of the affected artery is not only of
diagnostic value but also relieves the patient of painful
symptoms.
Grossly, the affected artery is thickened, cord-like and the
lumen is usually reduced to a narrow slit.
Histologically, the features include the following:
i)
There is chronic granulomatous reaction, usually
around the internal elastic lamina and typically involves
the entire circumference of the vessel.
ii) Giant cells of foreign body or Langhans’ type are found
in two-third of cases.
Figure 15.13
Leucocytoclastic vasculitis. The vessel wall shows
fibrinoid necrosis surrounded by viable as well as fragmented neutrophils.

404
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
iii) The internal elastic lamina is often fragmented.
iv) There is eccentric or concentric intimal cellular
proliferation causing marked narrowing of the lumen. The
narrowed lumen may contain thrombus.
v) Occasionally, only nonspecific inflammatory cell
infiltrate consisting of neutrophils, lymphocytes and
eosinophils is found throughout the arterial wall.
Takayasu’s Arteritis (Pulseless Disease)
This is a form of granulomatous vasculitis affecting chiefly
the aorta and its major branches and hence is also referred to
as aortic arch syndrome. The disease affects chiefly young
women and is typically characterised by absence of pulse in
both arms and presence of ocular manifestations. Other
features referable to ischaemic effects from thrombotic
occlusion of vessels include myocardial infarction, congestive
heart failure and neurologic deficits. The etiology of
Takayasu’s arteritis is not known but the autoimmune
reaction to aortic tissue has been suggested as the possible
cause.
Grossly, the aortic wall is irregularly thickened and intima
wrinkled. The branches of major arteries coming off the
aortic arch have obliterated lumina.
Histologically, the features are as under:
i)
There is severe mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate
involving the full thickness of the affected vessel wall.
ii) The inflammatory changes are more severe in the
adventitia and media and there is perivascular infiltration
of the vasa vasorum.
iii) Granulomatous changes in the media with central
necrosis and Langhans’ giant cells are found in many
cases.
iv) Advanced lesions show extensive fibrosis of the media
and adventitia causing thickening in the vessel wall.
Kawasaki’s Disease
Also known by more descriptive name of ‘mucocutaneous
lymph node syndrome’, it is an acute and subacute illness
affecting mainly young children and infants. Kawasaki’s
disease is a febrile illness with mucocutaneous symptoms
like erosions of oral mucosa and conjunctiva, skin rash and
lymphadenopathy. The etiology is unknown; possible causes
considered are infectious, genetic, toxic and immunological.
The most characteristic finding is the presence of multiple
aneurysms of the coronaries detected by angiography during
life or observed at autopsy. Other vessels that may be
involved are renal, mesenteric, hepatic and pancreatic
arteries.
Histologically, the picture is of panarteritis resembling
PAN, characterised by necrosis and inflammation of the
entire thickness of the vessel wall. Therefore, some
consider Kawasaki’s disease as an infantile form of PAN.
Buerger’s Disease (Thromboangiitis Obliterans)
Buerger’s disease is a specific disease entity affecting chiefly
small and medium-sized arteries and veins of the extremities
and characterised by acute and chronic occlusive
inflammatory involvement. The disease affects chiefly men
under the age of 35 years who are heavy cigarette smokers.
The symptom-complex consists of intermittent claudication
due to ischaemia manifested by intense pain affecting the
limbs, more commonly the legs. Eventually, gangrene of the
affected extremities occurs requiring amputation.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Following possible mechanisms
have been suggested:
There is consistent association with heavy cigarette
smoking. This has led to the hypothesis that tobacco products
cause either direct endothelial damage leading to
hypercoagulability and thrombosis, or it is a result in
hypersensitivity to tobacco products. In support is the
demonstration of anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECAs).
Genetic factors play a role as the disease has familial
occurrence and has HLA association. An increased
prevalence is seen in individuals with HLA-A9 and HLA-B5
antigens. It is seen more commonly in persons from Israel,
Japan and in India.
Grossly, the lesions are typically segmental affecting small
and medium-sized arteries, especially of the lower
extremities. Involvement of the arteries is often
accompanied with involvement of adjacent veins and
nerves. Fibrous tissue cuff generally surrounds these three
structures. Mural thrombi are frequently present in the
vessels.
Microscopically, the following changes are seen in
different stages of the disease:
i)
In early stage, there is infiltration by polymorphs in all
the layers of vessels and there is invariable presence of
mural or occlusive thrombosis of the lumen (Fig. 15.14).
The appearance differs from atherosclerosis in having
microabscesses in the thrombi, proliferation of endothelial
cells, lack of lipid aggregates and presence of intact
internal elastic lamina.
ii) In advanced stage, the cellular infiltrate is predomi-
nantly mononuclear and may contain an occasional
epithelioid cell granuloma with Langhans’ giant cells. The
thrombi undergo organisation and recanalisation. In more
chronic cases, marked fibrosis of the media is present.
Miscellaneous Hypersensitivity Vasculitis
Various connective tissue diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis,
ankylosing spondylitis and SLE), rheumatic fever, certain
malignancies and Henoch-Schönlein purpura are associated
with vasculitis. The type of vasculitis is generally of
hypersensitivity or allergic angiitis as already explained but
sometimes may resemble PAN.
Rheumatoid vasculitis affects chiefly the small and
medium-sized arteries of multiple visceral organs in patients
who have rheumatoid nodules of long duration. Vasculitis
in SLE affects mainly the small arteries of the skin.
Rheumatic vasculitis involves the aorta, carotid and
coronary arteries and the visceral vessels. Usually, fibrinoid
change and perivascular inflammation are seen rather than
typical Aschoff nodules (page 439).

CHAPTER 15
The Blood Vessels and Lymphatics
Raynaud’s Disease and Raynaud’s Phenomenon
Raynaud’s disease is not a vasculitis but is a functional
vasospastic disorder affecting chiefly small arteries and
arterioles of the extremities, occurring in otherwise young
healthy females. The disease affects most commonly the
fingers and hands. The ischaemic effect is provoked primarily
by cold but other stimuli such as emotions, trauma, hormones
and drugs also play a role. Clinically, the affected digits show
pallor, followed by cyanosis, and then redness, corresponding
to arterial ischaemia, venostasis and hyperaemia respectively.
Long-standing cases may develop ulceration and necrosis
of digits but occurrence of true gangrene is rare. The cause
of the disease is unknown but probably occurs due to
vasoconstriction mediated by autonomic stimulation of the
affected vessels. Though usually no pathologic changes are
observed in the affected vessels, long-standing cases may
show endothelial proliferation and intimal thickening.
Raynaud’s phenomenon differs from Raynaud’s disease in
having an underlying cause e.g. secondary to arthero-
sclerosis, connective tissue diseases like scleroderma and
SLE, Buerger’s disease, multiple myeloma, pulmonary
hypertension and ingestion of ergot group of drugs.
Raynaud’s phenomenon like Raynaud’s disease, also shows
cold sensitivity but differs from the latter in having structural
abnormalities in the affected vessels. These changes include
segmental inflammation and fibrinoid change in the walls
of capillaries.
ANEURYSMS
DEFINITION
An aneurysm is defined as a permanent abnormal dilatation
of a blood vessel occurring due to congenital or acquired
weakening or destruction of the vessel wall. Most commonly,
aneurysms involve large elastic arteries, especially the aorta
and its major branches. Aneurysms can cause various ill-
effects such as thrombosis and thromboembolism, alteration
in the flow of blood, rupture of the vessel and compression
of neighbouring structures.
CLASSIFICATION
Aneurysms can be classified on the basis of various features:
A. Depending upon the composition of the wall:
1
True aneurysm composed of all the layers of a normal
vessel wall.
2.
False aneurysm having fibrous wall and occurring often
from trauma to the vessel.
B. Depending upon the shape: These are as under
(Fig. 15.15):
1.
Saccular having large spherical outpouching.
2.
Fusiform having slow spindle-shaped dilatation.
3.
Cylindrical with a continuous parallel dilatation.
4.
Serpentine or varicose which has tortuous dilatation of the
vessel.
Figure 15.14
Buerger’s disease (Thromboangiitis obliterans). There is acute panarteritis. The lumen is occluded by a thrombus containing
microabscesses.

406
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
5.
Racemose or circoid having mass of intercommunicating
small arteries and veins.
C. Based on pathogenetic mechanisms: This classification
is followed most often (Fig. 15.16):
1.
Atherosclerotic (arteriosclerotic) aneurysms are the most
common type.
2.
Syphilitic (luetic) aneurysms found in the tertiary stage of
the syphilis.
3.
Dissecting aneurysms (Dissecting haematoma) in which the
blood enters the separated or dissected wall of the vessel.
4.
Mycotic aneurysms which result from weakening of the
arterial wall by microbial infection.
5. Berry aneurysms which are small dilatations especially
affecting the circle of Willis in the base of the brain (Chapter
30).
The three common types of aortic aneurysms—athero-
sclerotic, syphilitic and dissecting, are described below:
Atherosclerotic Aneurysms
Atherosclerotic aneurysms are the most common form of
aortic aneurysms. They are seen more commonly in males
and the frequency increases after the age of 50 years when
the incidence of complicated lesions of advanced
atherosclerosis is higher. They are most common in the
abdominal aorta, so much so that all forms of aneurysms of
abdominal aorta (fusiform, cylindrical and saccular) should
be considered atherosclerotic until proved otherwise. Other
locations include thoracic aorta (essentially the ascending
part and arch of aorta), iliac arteries and other large systemic
arteries.
PATHOGENESIS. Obviously, severe atherosclerotic lesions
are the basic problem which cause thinning and destruction
of the medial elastic tissue resulting in atrophy and
weakening of the wall. Since atherosclerotic lesions are most
common and severe in the abdominal aorta, atherosclerotic
aneurysms occur most frequently here. In the thoracic aorta,
besides atherosclerotic lesions, medial degeneration is
another additional factor implicated in pathogenesis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Atherosclerotic aneu-
rysms of the abdominal aorta are most frequently infra-
renal, above the bifurcation of the aorta but may extend
into common iliac arteries. They may be of variable size
but are often larger than 5-6 cm in diameter.
Atherosclerotic aneurysm is most frequently fusiform in
shape and the lumen of aneurysm often contains mural
thrombus.
Histologically, the wall of atherosclerotic aneurysm loses
its normal arterial structure. Instead, there is predo-
minance of fibrous tissue in the media and adventitia with
mild chronic inflammatory reaction. The intima and inner
part of the media show remnants of atheromatous plaques
and mural thrombus.
EFFECTS. The clinical effects of atherosclerotic aneurysms
are due to complications. These are as under:
1.
Rupture. Rupture of the atherosclerotic aneurysm is the
most serious and fatal complication. The risk of rupture
depends upon the size and duration of the aneurysm and
the blood pressure. Rupture of abdominal aneurysm may
occur either into the peritoneum or into the retroperitoneum
resulting in sudden and massive bleeding. Occasionally,
there may be slow progressive leak from the aneurysm. A
ruptured aneurysm is more likely to get infected.
2.
Compression. The atherosclerotic aneurysm may press
upon some adjacent structures such as compression of ureter
and erosion on the vertebral bodies.
3.
Arterial occlusion. Atherosclerotic aneurysms of the
abdominal aorta may occlude the inferior mesenteric artery,
or there may be development of occlusive thrombosis.
However, collateral circulation develops slowly and is nearly
always sufficient so as not to produce effects of ischaemia.
Thromboembolism is rather common in abdominal
aneurysms.
Syphilitic (Luetic) Aneurysms
Cardiovascular syphilis occurs in about 10% cases of syphilis.
It causes arteritis—syphilitic aortitis and cerebral arteritis,
both of which are already described in this chapter. One of
the major complications of syphilitic aortitis is syphilitic or
luetic aneurysm that develops in the tertiary stage of syphilis.
It usually manifests after the age of 50 years and is more
common in men. The predominant site of involvement is the
thoracic aorta, especially in the ascending part and arch of
aorta. It may extend proximally into the aortic valve causing
aortic incompetence and may lead to syphilitic heart disease.
Less often, it may extend distally to involve abdominal aorta.
PATHOGENESIS. About 40% cases of syphilitic aortitis
develop syphilitic aneurysms. The process begins from
inflammatory infiltrate around the vasa vasorum of the
Figure 15.16
Sites of major forms of aneurysms.

407
CHAPTER 15
The Blood Vessels and Lymphatics
adventitia, followed by endarteritis obliterans. This results
in ischaemic injury to the media causing destruction of the
smooth muscle and elastic tissue of the media and scarring.
Since syphilitic aortitis involves the proximal aorta
maximally, aortic aneurysm is found most frequently in the
ascending aorta and in the aortic arch.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Syphilitic aneurysms
occurring most often in the ascending part and the arch
of aorta are saccular in shape and usually 3-5 cm in
diameter. Less often, they are fusiform or cylindrical. The
intimal surface is wrinkled and shows tree-bark appearance.
When the aortic valve is involved, there is stretching and
rolling of the valve-leaflets producing valvular
incompetence and left ventricular hypertrophy due to
volume overload. This results in massively enlarged heart
called ‘cor bovinum’.
Histologically, the features of healed syphilitic aortitis are
seen (page 401). The adventitia shows fibrous thickening
with endarteritis obliterans of vasa vasorum. The fibrous
scar tissue may extend into the media and the intima.
Rarely, spirochaetes may be demonstrable in syphilitic
aneurysm. Often, mural thrombus is found in the
aneurysm.
EFFECTS. The clinical manifestations are found much more
frequently in syphilitic aneurysms than in atherosclerotic
aneurysms. The effects include the following:
1.
Rupture. Syphilitic aneurysm is likely to rupture causing
massive and fatal haemorrhage into the pleural cavity,
pericardial sac, trachea and oesophagus.
2.
Compression. The aneurysm may press on the adjacent
tissues and cause symptoms such as on trachea causing
dyspnoea, on oesophagus causing dysphagia, on recurrent
laryngeal nerve leading to hoarseness; and erosion of
vertebrae, sternum and ribs due to persistent pressure.
3.
Cardiac dysfunction. When the aortic root and valve are
involved, syphilitic aneurysm produces aortic incompetence
and cardiac failure. Narrowing of the coronary ostia may
further aggravate cardiac disease.
Dissecting Aneurysms and Cystic Medial Necrosis
The term dissecting aneurysm is applied for a dissecting
haematoma in which the blood enters the separated
(dissected) wall of the vessel and spreads for varying distance
longitudinally. The most common site is the aorta and is an
acute catastrophic aortic disease. The condition occurs most
commonly in men in the age range of 50 to 70 years. In
women, dissecting aneurysms may occur during pregnancy.
PATHOGENESIS. The pathogenesis of dissecting aneurysm
is explained on the basis of weakened aortic media. Various
conditions causing weakening in the aortic wall resulting in
dissection are as under:
i)
Hypertensive state. About 90% cases of dissecting
aneurysm have hypertension which predisposes such
patients to degeneration of the media in some questionable
way.
ii) Non-hypertensive cases. These are cases in whom there
is some local or systemic connective tissue disorder e.g.
a) Marfan’s syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease with
genetic defect in fibrillin which is a connective tissue protein
required for elastic tissue formation.
b) Development of cystic medial necrosis of Erdheim, especially
in old age.
c) Iatrogenic trauma during cardiac catheterisation or
coronary bypass surgery.
d) Pregnancy, for some unknown reasons.
Once medial necrosis has occurred, haemodynamic
factors, chiefly hypertension, cause tear in the intima and
initiate the dissecting aneurysms. The media is split at its
weakest point by the inflowing blood. An alternative
suggestion is that the medial haemorrhage from the vasa
vasorum occurs first and the intimal tear follows it. Further
extension of aneurysm occurs due to entry of blood into the
media through the intimal tear.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Dissecting aneurysm
differs from atherosclerotic and syphilitic aneurysms in
having no significant dilatation. Therefore, it is currently
referred to as ‘dissecting haematoma’. Dissecting aneurysm
classically begins in the arch of aorta. In 95% of cases, there
is a sharply-incised, transverse or oblique intimal tear, 3-
4 cm long, most often located in the ascending part of the
aorta. The dissection is seen most characteristically
between the outer and middle third of the aortic media so
that the column of blood in the dissection separates the
intima and inner two-third of the media on one side from the
outer one-third of the media and the adventitia on the other.
The dissection extends proximally into the aortic valve
ring as well as distally into the abdominal aorta
(Fig. 15.17).
Occasionally, the dissection may extend into the
branches of aorta like into the arteries of the neck, coro-
naries, renal, mesenteric and iliac arteries. The dissection
may affect the entire circumference of the aortic media or
a segment of it. In about 10% of dissecting aneurysms, a
second intimal tear is seen in the distal part of the
dissection so that the blood enters the false lumen through
the proximal tear and re-enters the true lumen through
the distal tear. If the patient survives, the false lumen may
develop endothelial lining and ‘double-barrel aorta’ is
formed.
Two classification schemes for dissections of thoracic
aorta and intramural haematoma have been described
(Fig. 15.18):
I. DeBakey classification. Depending upon the extent of
aortic dissection, three types are described:
Type I: Comprises 75% of cases; the intimal tear begins in
the ascending aorta but dissection extends distally for
some distance.
Type II: Comprises 5% of cases and dissection is limited
to the ascending aorta.
Type III: Constitutes the remaining 20% cases. In these
cases, intimal tear begins in the descending thoracic aorta
near the origin of subclavian artery and dissection extends
distally.

408
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
II. Stanford classification. Depending upon clinical
management, these are divided into 2 types:
Type A (Proximal dissection): Involves the ascending aorta
and includes type I and II of the above scheme because
clinical management of DeBakey type I and II is not
different.
Type B (Distal dissection): Limited to descending aorta
and sparing the ascending aorta; it corresponds to
DeBakey type III.
Histologically, the characteristic features of cystic medial
necrosis are found. These are as under:
Focal separation of the fibromuscular and elastic tissue
of the media.
Numerous cystic spaces in the media containing
basophilic ground substance.
Fragmentation of the elastic tissue.
Increased fibrosis of the media.
EFFECTS. The classical clinical manifestation of a dissecting
aneurysm is excruciating tearing pain in the chest moving
downwards. The complications arising from dissecting
aneurysms are as under:
1.
Rupture. Haemorrhage from rupture of a dissecting
aneurysm in the ascending aorta results in mortality in 90%
of cases. Most often, haemorrhage occurs into the
pericardium; less frequently it may rupture into thoracic
cavity, abdominal cavity or retroperitoneum.
2.
Cardiac disease. Involvement of the aortic valve results
in aortic incompetence. Obstruction of coronaries results in
ischaemia causing fatal myocardial infarction. Rarely,
dissecting aneurysm may extend into the cardiac chamber.
3.
Ischaemia. Obstruction of the branches of aorta by
dissection results in ischaemia of the tissue supplied. Thus,
there may be renal infarction, cerebral ischaemia and
infarction of the spinal cord.

dissection: Stanford and DeBakey. Stanford type A involving ascending
aorta only includes DeBakey’s type I (involving ascending aorta and

corresponds to DeBakey type III.

CHAPTER 15
The Blood Vessels and Lymphatics
FIBROMUSCULAR DYSPLASIA
Fibromuscular dysplasia first described in 1976, is a non-
atherosclerotic and non-inflammatory disease affecting
arterial wall, most often renal artery. Though the process may
involve intima, media or adventitia, medial fibroplasia is the
most common.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the involvement
is characteristically segmental—affecting vessel in a bead-
like pattern with intervening uninvolved areas.
Microscopically, the beaded areas show collections of
smooth muscle cells and connective tissue. There is often
rupture and retraction of internal elastic lamina.
The main effects of renal fibromuscular dysplasia,
depending upon the region of involvement, are renovascular
hypertension and changes of renal atrophy.
VEINS
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The structure of normal veins is basically similar to that of
arteries. The walls of the veins are thinner, the three tunicae
(intima, media and adventitia) are less clearly demarcated,
elastic tissue is scanty and not clearly organised into internal
and external elastic laminae. The media contains very small
amount of smooth muscle cells with abundant collagen. All
veins, except vena cavae and common iliac veins, have valves
best developed in veins of the lower limbs. The valves are
delicate folds of intima, located every 1-6 cm, often next to
the point of entry of a tributary vein. They prevent any
significant retrograde venous blood flow.
VARICOSITIES
Varicosities are abnormally dilated and tortuous veins. The
veins of lower extremities are involved most frequently,
called varicose veins. The veins of other parts of the body
which are affected are the lower oesophagus (oesophageal
varices, Chapter 19), the anal region (haemorrhoids, Chapter
20) and the spermatic cord (varicocele, Chapter 23).
VARICOSE  VEINS
Varicose veins are permanently dilated and tortuous
superficial veins of the lower extremities, especially the long
saphenous vein and its tributaries. About 10-12% of the
general population develops varicose veins of lower legs,
with the peak incidence in 4th and 5th decades of life. Adult
females are affected more commonly than the males,
especially during pregnancy. This is attributed to venous
stasis in the lower legs because of compression on the iliac
veins by pregnant uterus.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. A number of etiologic and
pathogenetic factors are involved in causing varicose veins.
These are as follows:
i)
Familial weakness of vein walls and valves is the most
common cause.
ii) Increased intraluminal pressure due to prolonged upright
posture e.g. in nurses, policemen, surgeons etc.
iii) Compression of iliac veins e.g. during pregnancy,
intravascular thrombosis, growing tumour etc.
iv) Hormonal effects on smooth muscle.
v) Obesity.
vi) Chronic constipation.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The affected veins, espe-
cially of the lower extremities, are dilated, tortuous,
elongated and nodular. Intraluminal thrombosis and
valvular deformities are often found.
Histologically, there is variable fibromuscular thickening
of the wall of the veins due to alternate dilatation and
hypertrophy. Degeneration of the medial elastic tissue
may occur which may be followed by calcific foci. Mural
thrombosis is commonly present which may get organised
and hyalinised leading to irregular intimal thickening.
EFFECTS. Varicose veins of the legs result in venous stasis
which is followed by congestion, oedema, thrombosis, stasis,
dermatitis, cellulitis and ulceration. Secondary infection
results in chronic varicose ulcers.
PHLEBOTHROMBOSIS AND  THROMBOPHLEBITIS
The terms ‘phlebothrombosis’ or thrombus formation in veins,
and ‘thrombophlebitis’ or inflammatory changes within the
vein wall, are currently used synonymously.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Venous thrombosis that precedes
thrombophlebitis is initiated by triad of changes: endothelial
damage, alteration in the composition of blood and venous
stasis. The factors that predispose to these changes are cardiac
failure, malignancy, use of oestrogen-containing compounds,
postoperative state and immobility due to various reasons.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The most common
locations for phlebothrombosis and thrombophlebitis are
the deep veins of legs accounting for 90% of cases; it is
commonly termed as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Other
locations are periprostatic venous plexus in males, pelvic
veins in the females, and near the foci of infection in the
abdominal cavity such as acute appendicitis, peritonitis,
acute salpingitis and pelvic abscesses.
Grossly, the affected veins may appear normal or may be
distended and firm. Often, a mural or occlusive thrombus
is present.
Histologically, the thrombus that is attached to the vein
wall induces inflammatory-reparative response beginning
from the intima and infiltrating into the thrombi. The
response consists of mononuclear inflammatory cells and
fibroblastic proliferation. In late stage, thrombus is either
organised or resolved leading to a thick-walled fibrous
vein.
EFFECTS. The clinical effects due to phlebothrombosis and
thrombophlebitis may be local or systemic.
Local effects are oedema distal to occlusion, heat, swelling,
tenderness, redness and pain.

410
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Systemic effects are more severe and occur due to embolic
phenomena, pulmonary thromboembolism being the most
common and most important. Other systemic manifestations
include bacteraemia and septic embolisation to brain,
meninges, liver etc.
Special Types of Phlebothrombosis
A few special variants of phlebothrombosis are considered
below:
1.
THROMBOPHLEBITIS MIGRANS. Thrombophlebitis
migrans or migratory thrombophlebitis or Trousseau’s
syndrome is the term used for multiple venous thrombi that
disappear from one site so as to appear at another site. The
condition is not a morphologic entity but a clinical one, seen
most often in disseminated visceral cancers (e.g. cancer of
lungs, prostate, female reproductive tract, breast, pancreas
and gastrointestinal tract) as part of paraneoplastic syndrome
and is also found in nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis.
2.
PHLEGMASIA ALBA DOLENS. This term meaning
‘painful white leg’ refers to extensive swelling of the leg,
occurring most frequently due to iliofemoral venous
thrombosis. It occurs most often in women during late
pregnancy or following delivery when the pregnant uterus
causes pressure on the iliofemoral veins, or after extensive
pelvic surgery. Development of pulmonary embolism may
occur due to involvement of inferior vena cava.
3.
PHLEGMASIA CERULEA DOLENS. This term
meaning ‘painful blue leg’ refers to markedly swollen bluish
skin with superficial gangrene. It is a serious complication
of massive iliofemoral venous thrombosis and decreased
arterial blood flow.
4.
SUPERIOR VENA CAVAL SYNDROME. Superior
vena caval syndrome refers to obstruction of the superior
vena cava. The obstruction results most often from external
compression or from thrombosis. Some of the common
causes of superior vena caval syndrome are malignancy
(especially lung cancer and lymphoma), syphilitic aortic
aneurysm and tuberculous mediastinitis. Clinical features
include dilated veins of neck and thorax, oedema of the face,
neck and upper chest, visual disturbances and disturbed
sensorium.
5.
INFERIOR VENA CAVAL SYNDROME. Inferior vena
caval syndrome is the obstruction of the inferior vena cava.
Most often, obstruction results from thrombosis by extension
from iliofemoral veins. Other causes of obstruction are
external compression and neoplastic invasion. Clinical
features are oedema of lower extremities, dilated leg veins
and collateral venous channels in the lower abdomen
LYMPHATICS
NORMAL STRUCTURE
Lymphatic capillaries, lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes
comprise the lymphatic system. Lymphatic capillaries
resemble blood capillaries, and larger lymphatics are
identical to veins. However, lymphatics lined by a single
layer of endothelium have thin muscle in their walls than in
veins of the same size and the valves are more numerous.
Lymphatic capillaries and lymphatics form plexuses around
tissues and organs. The walls of lymphatic capillaries are
permeable to tissue fluid, proteins and particulate matter.
LYMPHANGITIS
Inflammation of the lymphatics or lymphangitis may be acute
or chronic.
Acute lymphangitis occurs in the course of many bacterial
infections. The most common organisms are (β-haemolytic
streptococci and staphylococci). Acute lymphangitis is often
associated with lymphadenitis.
Grossly, the affected lymphatics are dilated and appear
as cutaneous streaks.
Microscopically, the dilated lumen contains acute
inflammatory exudate, cell debris and clotted lymph.
There is inflammatory infiltration into the perilymphatic
tissues alongwith hyperaemia and oedema. Acute
lymphangitis generally heals completely.
Chronic lymphangitis occurs due to persistent and recurrent
acute lymphangitis or from chronic infections like
tuberculosis, syphilis and actinomycosis.
Histologically, there is permanent obstruction due to
fibrosis of affected lymphatics called chronic
lymphoedema.
LYMPHOEDEMA
Lymphoedema is swelling of soft tissues due to localised
increase in the quantity of lymph (page 97). It may be primary
(idiopathic) or secondary (obstructive).
I.
PRIMARY (IDIOPATHIC) LYMPHOEDEMA. Lymph-
oedema occurring without underlying secondary cause is
called primary or idiopathic lymphoedema. Its various types
are as under:
1.
Congenital lymphoedema. Congenital lymphoedema
has further 2 subtypes—familial hereditary form (Milroy’s
disease) and non-familial (simple) form.
i)
Milroy’s disease is a form of congenital and familial
oedema generally affecting one limb but at times may be
more extensive and involve the eyelids and lips. The disease
is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and is often
associated with other congenital anomalies. The condition
results from developmental defect of lymphatic channels so
that the affected tissue shows abnormally dilated lymphatics
and the area shows honey-combed appearance. Recurrent
infection of the tissue causes cellulitis and fibrosis of
lymphatic vessels.
ii) Simple congenital lymphoedema is non-familial form with
unknown etiology. It is often associated with Turner’s
syndrome and affects one member of the family. The
pathologic changes are similar to those of Milroy’s disease.
2.
Lymphoedema praecox. This is a rare form of lymph-
oedema affecting chiefly young females. The oedema usually

411
CHAPTER 15
The Blood Vessels and Lymphatics
begins in the foot and progresses slowly upwards to involve
the whole extremity. With passage of time, the affected area
becomes rough and the oedema is non-pitting. The etiology
is unknown but probably the condition is related to female
reproductive system because of preponderance in females
and aggravation during menses.
II. SECONDARY (OBSTRUCTIVE) LYMPHOEDEMA.
This is more common form of lymphoedema. Various causes
of lymphatic obstruction causing lymphoedema are as under:
i)
Lymphatic invasion by malignant tumour.
ii) Surgical removal of lymphatics e.g. in radical
mastectomy.
iii) Post-irradiation fibrosis.
iv) Parasitic infestations e.g. in filariasis of lymphatics
producing elephantiasis.
v) Lymphangitis causing scarring and obstruction.
Obstructive lymphoedema occurs only when the
obstruction is widespread as otherwise collaterals develop.
The affected area consists of dilatation of lymphatics distal
to obstruction with increased interstitial fluid. With passage
of time, there is inflammatory scarring and the lymphatics
become fibrosed with enlargement of the affected part.
Rupture of dilated large lymphatics may result in escape of
milky chyle into the peritoneum (chyloperitoneum), into the
pleural cavity (chylothorax), into pericardial cavity (chylo-
pericardium) and into the urinary tract (chyluria).
TUMOURS AND TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS
Majority of benign vascular tumours are malformations or
hamartomas. A hamartoma is a tumour-like lesion made up
of tissues indigenous to the part but lacks the true growth
potential of true neoplasms. However, there is no clear-cut
distinction between vascular hamartomas and true benign
tumours and are often described together. On the other hand,
there are true vascular tumours which are of intermediate
grade and there are frank malignant tumours.
A classification of vascular tumours and tumour-like
conditions is given in Table 15.5.
A. BENIGN TUMOURS AND HAMARTOMAS
Haemangioma
Haemangiomas are quite common lesions, especially in
infancy and childhood. The most common site is the skin of
the face. Amongst the various clinical and histologic types,
three important forms are described below.
CAPILLARY HAEMANGIOMA. These are the most
common type. Clinically, they appear as small or large, flat
or slightly elevated, red to purple, soft and lobulated lesions,
varying in size from a few millimeters to a few centimeters
in diameter. They may be present at birth or appear in early
childhood. Strawberry birthmarks and ‘port-wine mark’ are
some good examples. The common sites are the skin,
subcutaneous tissue and mucous membranes of oral cavity
and lips. Less common sites are internal visceral organs like
liver, spleen and kidneys.
Histologically, capillary haemangiomas are well-defined
but unencapsulated lobules. These lobules are composed
of capillary-sized, thin-walled, blood-filled vessels. These
vessels are lined by single layer of plump endothelial cells
surrounded by a layer of pericytes. The vessels are
separated by some connective tissue stroma (Fig. 15.19).

stroma consists of scant connective tissue.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Many of the capillary haemangiomas regress sponta-
neously within a few years.
CAVERNOUS HAEMANGIOMA. Cavernous haeman-
giomas are single or multiple, discrete or diffuse, red to blue,
soft and spongy masses. They are often 1 to 2 cm in diameter.
They are most common in the skin (especially of the face
and neck); other sites are mucosa of the oral cavity, stomach
and small intestine, and internal visceral organs like the liver
and spleen.
Histologically, cavernous haemangiomas are composed
of thin-walled cavernous vascular spaces, filled partly or
completely with blood. The vascular spaces are lined by
flattened endothelial cells. They are separated by scanty
connective tissue stroma (Fig. 15.20).
Cavernous haemangiomas rarely involute spontaneously.
GRANULOMA PYOGENICUM. Granuloma pyogenicum
is also referred to as haemangioma of granulation tissue type.
True to its name, it appears as exophytic, red granulation
tissue just like a nodule, commonly on the skin and mucosa
of gingiva or oral cavity. Pregnancy tumour or granuloma
gravidarum is a variant occurring on the gingiva during
pregnancy and regresses after delivery. Granuloma
pyogenicum often develops following trauma and is usually
1 to 2 cm in diameter.
Histologically, it shows proliferating capillaries similar
to capillary haemangioma but the capillaries are separated
by abundant oedema and inflammatory infiltrate, thus
resembling inflammatory granulation tissue.
Lymphangioma
Lymphangiomas are lymphatic counterparts of vascular
angiomas. Lymphangiomas are congenital lesions which are
classified as capillary, cavernous and cystic hygroma.
Combinations are also often seen.
CAPILLARY LYMPHANGIOMA. It is also called as
lymphangioma simplex. It is a small, circumscribed, slightly
elevated lesion measuring 1 to 2 cm in diameter. The common
locations are the skin of head and neck, axilla and mucous
membranes. Rarely, these may be found in the internal
organs.
Histologically, capillary lymphangioma is composed of
a network of endothelium-lined, capillary-sized spaces
containing lymph and often separated by lymphoid
aggregates.
CAVERNOUS LYMPHANGIOMA. It is more common than
the capillary type. The common sites are in the region of head
and neck or axilla. A large cystic variety called cystic hygroma
occurs in the neck producing gross deformity in the neck.
Histologically, cavernous lymphangioma consists of large
dilated lymphatic spaces lined by flattened endothelial
cells and containing lymph. Scanty intervening stromal
connective tissue is present (Fig. 15.21). These lesions,
though benign, are often difficult to remove due to
infiltration into adjacent tissues.
Glomus Tumour (Glomangioma)
Glomus tumour is an uncommon true benign tumour arising
from contractile glomus cells that are present in the
arteriovenous shunts (Sucquet-Hoyer anastomosis). These
tumours are found most often in the dermis of the fingers or
toes under a nail; other sites are mucosa of the stomach and
nasal cavity. These lesions are characterised by extreme pain.
They may be single or multiple, small, often less than 1 cm
in diameter, flat or slightly elevated, red-blue, painful
nodules.
Histologically, the tumours are composed of small blood
vessels lined by endothelium and surrounded by
aggregates, nests and masses of glomus cells. The glomus

CHAPTER 15
The Blood Vessels and Lymphatics
cells are round to cuboidal cells with scanty cytoplasm
(Fig. 15.22). The intervening connective tissue stroma
contains some non-myelinated nerve fibres.
Arteriovenous Malformations
An arteriovenous (AV) malformation is a communication
between an artery and vein without an intervening capillary
bed. It may be congenital or acquired type. Congenital AV
malformations have thick-walled vessels with hyalinisation
and calcification. Acquired AV malformations reveal changes
mainly in the veins which are dilated and thick-walled.
Bacillary Angiomatosis and Peliosis Hepatis
Bacillary angiomatosis is a tumour-like lesion reported in
association with HIV-AIDS with CD4+ T cell counts below
100/μl. In fact, it is an opportunistic infection with gram-
negative bacilli of Bartonella genus. Most common site of
involvement is the skin and bones while a closely related
condition peliosis hepatis is seen in the liver (Chapter 21).
Grossly, the lesions on the skin are in the form of variable-
sized red papules.
Histologically, lobules of proliferating blood vessels are
seen lined by epithelioid endothelial cells having mild
atypia. Mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate with nuclear
debris of neutrophils is present in these areas.
The condition is treated with antibiotics.
B. INTERMEDIATE GRADE TUMOURS
Haemangioendothelioma
Haemangioendothelioma is a true tumour of endothelial
cells, the behaviour of which is intermediate between a
haemangioma and haemangiosarcoma. It is found most often
in the skin and subcutaneous tissue in relation to medium-

sized and large veins. Haemangioblastoma is the term used
for similar tumour occurring in the cerebellum (Chapter 30).
Grossly, the tumour is usually well-defined, grey-red,
polypoid mass.
Microscopically, there is active proliferation of endothelial
cells forming several layers around the blood vessels so
that vascular lumina are difficult to identify. These cells
may have variable mitotic activity. Reticulin stain
delineates the pattern of cell proliferation inner to the
basement membrane (Fig. 15.23).
C. MALIGNANT  TUMOURS
Haemangiopericytoma
Haemangiopericytoma is an uncommon tumour arising from
pericytes. Pericytes are cells present external to the endo-
thelial cells of capillaries and venules. This is a rare tumour
that can occur at any site and at any age and may vary in
size from 1 to 8 cm.
Microscopically, the tumour is composed of capillaries
surrounded by spindle-shaped pericytes outside the
vascular basement membrane forming whorled
arrangement. These tumour cells may have high mitotic
rate and areas of necrosis. Silver impregnation stain (i.e.
reticulin stain) is employed to confirm the presence of
pericytes outside the basement membrane of capillaries
and to distinguish it from haemangioendothelioma
(Fig. 15.24).
Local recurrences are common and distant spread occurs
in about 20% of cases.
Angiosarcoma
Also known as haemangiosarcoma and malignant
haemangioendothelioma, it is a malignant vascular tumour
occurring most frequently in the skin, subcutaneous tissue,
liver, spleen, bone, lung and retroperitoneal tissues. It can
occur in both sexes and at any age. Hepatic angiosarcomas are
of special interest in view of their association with
carcinogens like polyvinyl chloride, arsenical pesticides and
radioactive contrast medium, thorotrast, used in the past.
Grossly, the tumours are usually bulky, pale grey-white,
firm masses with poorly-defined margins. Areas of
haemorrhage, necrosis and central softening are frequently
present.
Microscopically, the tumours may be well-differentiated
masses of proliferating endothelial cells around well-
formed vascular channels, to poorly-differentiated lesions
composed of plump, anaplastic and pleomorphic cells in
solid clusters with poorly identifiable vascular channels
(Fig. 15.25).
These tumours invade locally and frequently have distant
metastases in the lungs and other organs. Lymphangiosarcoma
is a histologically similar tumour occurring in obstructive
lymphoedema of long duration.
Kaposi’s Sarcoma
Kaposi’s sarcoma is a malignant angiomatous tumour, first
described by Kaposi, Hungarian dermatologist, in 1872.
However, the tumour has attracted greater attention in the
last two decades due to its frequent occurrence in patients
with HIV/AIDS.
CLASSIFICATION. Presently, four forms of Kaposi’s
sarcoma are described:
1.
Classic (European) Kaposi’s sarcoma. This is the form
which was first described by Kaposi. It is more common in
men over 60 years of age of Eastern European descent. The
disease is slow growing and appears as multiple, small,
purple, dome-shaped nodules or plaques in the skin,

CHAPTER 15
The Blood Vessels and Lymphatics
especially on the legs. Involvement of visceral organs occurs
in about 10% cases after many years.
2.
African (Endemic) Kaposi’s sarcoma. This form is
common in equatorial Africa. It is so common in Uganda
that it comprises 9% of all malignant tumours in men. It is
found in younger age, especially in boys and in young men
and has a more aggressive course than the classic form. The
disease begins in the skin but grows rapidly to involve other
tissues, especially lymph nodes and the gut.
3.
Epidemic (AIDS-associated) Kaposi’s sarcoma. This
form is seen in about 30% cases of AIDS, especially in young
male homosexuals than the other high-risk groups. The
cutaneous lesions are not localised to lower legs but are more
extensively distributed involving mucous membranes,
lymph nodes and internal organs early in the course of
disease.
4.
Kaposi’s sarcoma in renal transplant cases. This form is
associated with recipients of renal transplants who have been
administered immunosuppressive therapy for a long time.
The lesions may be localised to the skin or may have
widespread systemic involvement.

tumour cells show proliferation of moderately pleomorphic anaplastic cells. C, These tumour cells show positive staining for endothelial marker,
CD34.
PATHOGENESIS. Pathogenesis of Kaposi’s sarcoma is
complex. It is an opportunistic neoplasm in immunosup-
pressed patients which has excessive proliferation of spindle
cells of vascular origin having features of both endothelium
and smooth muscle cells:
Epidemiological studies have suggested a viral association
implicating HIV and human herpesvirus 8 (HSV 8, also called
Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus or KSHV).
Occurrence of Kaposi’s sarcoma involves interplay of
HIV-1 infection, HHV-8 infection, activation of the immune
system and secretion of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, GM-CSF,
basic fibroblast factor, and oncostain M). Higher incidence
of Kaposi’s sarcoma in male homosexuals is explained by
increased secretion of cytokines by their activated immune
system.
Defective immunoregulation plays a role in its
pathogenesis is further substantiated by observation of second
malignancy (e.g. leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma) in
about one-third of patients with Kaposi’s sarcoma.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Pathologically, all forms
of Kaposi’s sarcoma are similar
Figure 15.26
Kaposi’s sarcoma in late nodular stage. There are slit-like blood-filled vascular spaces. Between them are present bands of
plump spindle-shaped tumour cells.

416
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Grossly, the lesions in the skin, gut and other organs form
prominent, irregular, purple, dome-shaped plaques or
nodules.
Histologically, the changes are nonspecific in the early
patch stage and more characteristic in the late nodular stage.
Early patch stage: There are irregular vascular spaces
separated by interstitial inflammatory cells and
extravasated blood and haemosiderin.
Late nodular stage: There are slit-like vascular spaces
containing red blood cells and separated by spindle-
shaped, plump tumour cells. These spindle-shaped
tumour cells are probably of endothelial origin (Fig. 15.26).
CLINICAL COURSE. The clinical course and biologic
behaviour of Kaposi’s sarcoma is quite variable. The classic
form of Kaposi’s sarcoma is largely confined to skin and the
course is generally slow and insidious with long survival.
The endemic (African) and epidemic (AIDS-associated)
Kaposi’s sarcoma, on the other hand, has a rapidly
progressive course, often with widespread cutaneous as well
as visceral involvement, and high mortality.

CHAPTER 16
The Heart
NORMAL STRUCTURE
ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. The heart is a muscular
pump that ejects blood into the vascular tree with sufficient
pressure to maintain optimal circulation. Average weight of
the heart in an adult male is 300-350 gm while that of an
adult female is 250-300 gm. Heart is divided into four
chambers: a right and a left atrium both lying superiorly,
and a right and a left ventricle both lying inferiorly and are
larger. The atria are separated by a thin interatrial partition
called interatrial septum, while the ventricles are separated
by thick muscular partition called interventricular septum. The
thickness of the right ventricular wall is 0.3 to 0.5 cm while
that of the left ventricular wall is 1.3 to 1.5 cm. The blood in
the heart chambers moves in a carefully prescribed pathway:
venous blood from systemic circulation → right atrium →
right ventricle → pulmonary arteries → lungs → pulmonary
veins → left atrium → left ventricle → aorta → systemic
arterial supply (Fig. 16.1).
The transport of blood is regulated by cardiac valves: two
loose flap-like atrioventricular valves, tricuspid on the right
and mitral (bicuspid) on the left; and two semilunar valves
with three leaflets each, the pulmonary and aortic valves,
guarding the outflow tracts. The normal circumference of
the valvular openings measures about 12 cm in tricuspid,
8.5 cm in pulmonary, 10 cm in mitral and 7.5 cm in aortic
valve.
Wall of the heart consists mainly of the myocardium which
is covered externally by thin membrane, the epicardium or
visceral pericardium, and lined internally by another thin
layer, the endocardium.
The myocardium is the muscle tissue of the heart
composed of syncytium of branching and anastomosing,
transversely striated muscle fibres arranged in parallel
fashion. The space between myocardial fibres contains a rich
capillary network and loose connective tissue. The
myocardial fibres are connected to each other by irregular
joints called as intercalated discs. They represent apposed cell
membranes of individual cells which act as tight junctions
for free transport of ions and action potentials. The cardiac
myocyte is very rich in mitochondria which is the source of
large amount of ATP required for cardiac contraction. The
cardiac muscle fibre has abundant sarcoplasmic reticulum
corresponding to endoplasmic reticulum of other cells. Trans-
verse lines divide each fibre into sarcomeres which act as
structural and functional subunits. Each sarcomere consists
of prominent central dark A-band attributed to thick myosin
filaments and flanked on either side by light I-bands consisting
of thin actin filament. The actin bands are in the form of
twisted rods overlying protein molecules called tropomyosin.
These protein molecules are of 3 types: troponin-I, troponin-
T, and troponin-C. Troponin molecules respond to calcium
ions in cyclical contraction-relaxation of myocardial fibres.
Myocardial fibres are terminally differentiated cells and do
not regenerate but there is recent evidence that new cardiac
myocytes can be formed from stem cells recruited from the
circulation.
The conduction system of the heart located in the myocar-
dium is responsible for regulating rate and rhythm of the
heart. It is composed of specialised Purkinje fibres which
contain some contractile myofilaments and conduct action
potentials rapidly. The conduction system consists of 4 major
components:
1. The sinoatrial (SA) node is located in the posterior wall of
the right atrium adjacent to the point at which the superior
vena cava enters the heart. It is also called cardiac pacemaker
since it is responsible for determining the rate of contraction
for all cardiac muscle.
2.
The atrioventricular (AV) bundle conducts the impulse
from the SA node to the AV node.
3.
The atrioventricular (AV) node is located on the top of the
interventricular septum and receives impulses from the SA
node via AV bundle and transmits them to the bundle of
His.
4.
The bundle of His extends through the interventricular
septum and divides into right and left bundle branches
which arborise in the respective ventricular walls. These

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
fibres transmit impulses from the AV node to the ventricular
walls.
The pericardium consists of a closely apposed layer,
visceral pericardium or epicardium, and an outer fibrous sac,
the parietal pericardium. The two layers enclose a narrow
pericardial cavity which is lined by mesothelial cells and
normally contains 10-30 ml of clear, watery serous fluid. This
fluid functions as lubricant and shock absorbant to the heart.
The endocardium is the smooth shiny inner lining of the
myocardium that covers all the cardiac chambers, the cardiac
valves, the chordae tendineae and the papillary muscles. It
is lined by endothelium with connective tissue and elastic
fibres in its deeper part.
The valve cusps and semilunar leaflets are delicate and
translucent structures. The valves are strengthened by
collagen and elastic tissue and covered by a layer of
endothelium (valvular endocardium).
MYOCARDIAL BLOOD SUPPLY. The cardiac muscle, in
order to function properly, must receive adequate supply of
oxygen and nutrients. Blood is transported to myocardial
cells by the coronary arteries which originate immediately
above the aortic semilunar valve. Most of blood flow to the
myocardium occurs during diastole. There are three major
coronary trunks, each supplying blood to specific segments
of the heart (Fig. 16.2):
1.
The anterior descending branch of the left coronary
artery supplies most of the apex of the heart, the anterior
surface of the left ventricle, the adjacent third of the anterior
wall of the right ventricle, and the anterior two-third of the
interventricular septum.
2.
The circumflex branch of the left coronary artery
supplies the left atrium and a small portion of the lateral
aspect of the left ventricle.
3.
The right coronary artery supplies the right atrium, the
remainder of the anterior surface of the right ventricle, the
adjacent half of the posterior wall of the left ventricle and
the posterior third of the interventricular septum.
There are 3 anatomic patterns of distribution of the
coronary blood supply, depending upon which of the
coronary arteries crosses the crux. Crux is the region on the
posterior surface of the heart where all the four cardiac
chambers and the interatrial and interventricular septa meet.
These patterns are as under:
Right coronary artery preponderance is the most
common pattern. In this, right coronary artery supplies blood
to the whole of right ventricle, the posterior half of the
interventricular septum and a part of the posterior wall of
the left ventricle by crossing the crux.
Balanced cardiac circulation is the next most frequent
pattern. In this, the right and left ventricles receive blood
supply entirely from right and left coronary arteries
respectively. The posterior part of the interventricular septum
is supplied by a branch of the right coronary while the
anterior part is supplied by a branch of the left coronary
artery.
Left coronary preponderance is the least frequent pattern.
In this, the left coronary artery supplies blood to the entire
left ventricle, whole of interventricular septum and also
supplies blood to a part of the posterior wall of the right
ventricle by crossing the crux.
Coronary veins run parallel to the major coronary arteries
to collect blood after the cellular needs of the heart are met.
Subsequently, these veins drain into the coronary sinus.
PATTERNS AND CLASSIFICATION OF
HEART DISEASES
For the purpose of pathologic discussion of heart diseases,
they are categorised on the basis of anatomic region involved
and the functional impairment. Accordingly, topics on heart
diseases are discussed in this chapter under the following
headings:
1.
Heart failure
2.
Congenital heart diseases
3.
Ischaemic heart disease
4.
Hypertensive heart disease
5.
Cor pulmonale
6.
Rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease
7.
Non-rheumatic endocarditis
8.
Valvular diseases and deformities
9.
Myocardial disease
10. Pericardial disease
11. Tumours of the heart
12. Pathology of cardiovascular interventions.
It may be mentioned here that pattern of heart diseases
in developing and developed countries is distinct due to
difference in living standards. In children, valvular diseases
are common all over the world, but in developing countries
including India, infections, particularly rheumatic valvular
disease, is the dominant cause compared to congenital
etiology in affluent countries. On the other hand, ischaemic
heart disease and hypertensive cardiomyopathy are the
major heart diseases in adults in western populations.

CHAPTER 16
The Heart
HEART FAILURE
Definition
Heart failure is defined as the pathophysiologic state in which
impaired cardiac function is unable to maintain an adequate
circulation for the metabolic needs of the tissues of the body.
It may be acute or chronic. The term congestive heart failure
(CHF) is used for the chronic form of heart failure in which
the patient has evidence of congestion of peripheral
circulation and of lungs (Chapter 5). CHF is the end-result
of various forms of serious heart diseases.
Etiology
Heart failure may be caused by one of the following factors,
either singly or in combination:
1.
INTRINSIC PUMP FAILURE. The most common and
most important cause of heart failure is weakening of the
ventricular muscle due to disease so that the heart fails to
act as an efficient pump. The various diseases which may
culminate in pump failure by this mechanisms are as under:
i)
Ischaemic heart disease
ii) Myocarditis
iii) Cardiomyopathies
iv) Metabolic disorders e.g. beriberi
v) Disorders of the rhythm e.g. atrial fibrillation and flutter.
2.
INCREASED WORKLOAD ON THE HEART.
Increased mechanical load on the heart results in increased
myocardial demand resulting in myocardial failure.
Increased load on the heart may be in the form of pressure
load or volume load.
i)
Increased pressure load may occur in the following
states:
a) Systemic and pulmonary arterial hypertension.
b) Valvular disease e.g. mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis,
pulmonary stenosis.
c) Chronic lung diseases.
ii) Increased volume load occurs when a ventricle is
required to eject more than normal volume of the blood
resulting in cardiac failure. This is seen in the following
conditions:
a) Valvular insufficiency
b) Severe anaemia
c) Thyrotoxicosis
d) Arteriovenous shunts
e) Hypoxia due to lung diseases.
3. IMPAIRED FILLING OF CARDIAC CHAMBERS.
Decreased cardiac output and cardiac failure may result from
extra-cardiac causes or defect in filling of the heart:
a) Cardiac tamponade e.g. haemopericardium, hydroperi-
cardium
b) Constrictive pericarditis.
Types of Heart Failure
Heart failure may be acute or chronic, right-sided or left-
sided, and forward or backward failure.
ACUTE AND CHRONIC HEART FAILURE. Depending
upon whether the heart failure develops rapidly or slowly,
it may be acute or chronic.
Acute heart failure. Sudden and rapid development of heart
failure occurs in the following conditions:
i)
Larger myocardial infarction
ii) Valve rupture
iii) Cardiac tamponade
iv) Massive pulmonary embolism
v) Acute viral myocarditis
vi) Acute bacterial toxaemia.
In acute heart failure, there is sudden reduction in cardiac
output resulting in systemic hypotension but oedema does
not occur. Instead, a state of cardiogenic shock and cerebral
hypoxia develops.
Chronic heart failure. More often, heart failure develops
slowly as observed in the following states:
i)
Myocardial ischaemia from atherosclerotic coronary
artery disease
ii) Multivalvular heart disease
iii) Systemic arterial hypertension
iv) Chronic lung diseases resulting in hypoxia and pulmo-
nary arterial hypertension
v) Progression of acute into chronic failure.
In chronic heart failure, compensatory mechanisms like
tachycardia, cardiac dilatation and cardiac hypertrophy try
to make adjustments so as to maintain adequate cardiac
output. This often results in well-maintained arterial pressure
and there is accumulation of oedema.
LEFT-SIDED AND RIGHT-SIDED HEART FAILURE.
Though heart as an organ eventually fails as a whole, but
functionally, the left and right heart act as independent units.
From clinical point of view, therefore, it is helpful to consider
failure of the left and right heart separately. The clinical
manifestations of heart failure result from accumulation of
excess fluid upstream to the left or right cardiac chamber
whichever is initially affected (Fig. 16.3):
Left-sided heart failure. It is initiated by stress to the left
heart. The major causes are as follows:
i)
Systemic hypertension
ii) Mitral or aortic valve disease (stenosis)
iii) Ischaemic heart disease
iv) Myocardial diseases e.g. cardiomyopathies, myocarditis.
v) Restrictive pericarditis.
The clinical manifestations of left-sided heart failure result
from decreased left ventricular output and hence there is
accumulation of fluid upstream in the lungs. Accordingly, the
major pathologic changes are as under:
i)
Pulmonary congestion and oedema causes dyspnoea and
orthopnoea (Chapter 5).
ii) Decreased left ventricular output causing hypoperfusion
and diminished oxygenation of tissues e.g. in kidneys causing
ischaemic acute tubular necrosis (Chapter 22), in brain
causing hypoxic encephalopathy (Chapter 30), and in skeletal
muscles causing muscular weakness and fatigue.
Right-sided heart failure. Right-sided heart failure occurs
more often as a consequence of left-sided heart failure.

420
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
However, some conditions affect the right ventricle primarily,
producing right-sided heart failure. These are as follows:
i)
As a consequence of left ventricular failure.
ii) Cor pulmonale in which right heart failure occurs due to
intrinsic lung diseases (Chapter 17).
iii) Pulmonary or tricuspid valvular disease.
iv) Pulmonary hypertension secondary to pulmonary
thromboembolism.
v) Myocardial disease affecting right heart.
vi) Congenital heart disease with left-to-right shunt.
Whatever be the underlying cause, the clinical
manifestations of right-sided heart failure are upstream of the
right heart such as systemic (due to caval blood) and portal
venous congestion, and reduced cardiac output. Accordingly,
the pathologic changes are as under:
i)
Systemic venous congestion in different tissues and
organs e.g. subcutaneous oedema on dependent parts,
passive congestion of the liver, spleen, and kidneys (Chapter
5), ascites, hydrothorax, congestion of leg veins and neck
veins.
ii) Reduced cardiac output resulting in circulatory
stagnation causing anoxia, cyanosis and coldness of
extremities.
In summary, in early stage the left heart failure mani-
fests with features of pulmonary congestion and decreased
left ventricular output, while the right heart failure presents
with systemic venous congestion and involvement of the liver
and spleen. CHF, however, combines the features of both
left and right heart failure.
BACKWARD AND FORWARD HEART FAILURE. The
mechanism of clinical manifestations resulting from heart
failure can be explained on the basis of mutually inter-
dependent backward and forward failure.
Backward heart failure. According to this concept, either of
the ventricles fails to eject blood normally, resulting in rise
of end-diastolic volume in the ventricle and increase in
volume and pressure in the atrium which is transmitted
backward producing elevated pressure in the veins.
Forward heart failure. According to this hypothesis, clinical
manifestations result directly from failure of the heart to
pump blood causing diminished flow of blood to the tissues,
especially diminished renal perfusion and activation of renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system.
COMPENSATORY MECHANISMS:
CARDIAC HYPERTROPHY AND DILATATION
In order to maintain normal cardiac output, several
compensatory mechanisms play a role as under:
Compensatory enlargement in the form of cardiac
hypertrophy, cardiac dilatation, or both.
Tachycardia (i.e. increased heart rate) due to activation of
neurohumoral system e.g. release of norepinephrine and
atrial natrouretic peptide, activation of renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone mechanism.
According to Starling’s law on pathophysiology of heart,
the failing dilated heart, in order to maintain cardiac
performance, increases the myocardial contractility and
thereby attempts to maintain stroke volume. This is achieved
by increasing the length of sarcomeres in dilated heart.
Ultimately, however, dilatation decreases the force of
contraction and leads to residual volume in the cardiac

The Heart
chambers causing volume overload resulting in cardiac
failure that ends in death (Fig. 16.4).
Cardiac Hypertrophy
Hypertrophy of the heart is defined as an increase in size
and weight of the myocardium. It generally results from
increased pressure load while increased volume load (e.g.
valvular incompetence) results in hypertrophy with
dilatation of the affected chamber due to regurgitation of the
blood through incompetent valve. The atria may also
undergo compensatory changes due to increased workload.
The basic factors that stimulate the hypertrophy of the
myocardial fibres are not known. It appears that stretching
of myocardial fibres in response to stress induces the cells to
increase in length. The elongated fibres receive better
nutrition and thus increase in size. Other factors which may
stimulate increase in size of myocardial fibres are anoxia (e.g.
in coronary atherosclerosis) and influence of certain
hormones (e.g. catecholamines, pituitary growth hormone).
CAUSES. Hypertrophy with or without dilatation may
involve predominantly the left or the right heart, or both
sides.
Left ventricular hypertrophy. The common causes  are as
under:
i)
Systemic hypertension
ii) Aortic stenosis and insufficiency
iii) Mitral insufficiency
iv) Coarctation of the aorta
v) Occlusive coronary artery disease
vi) Congenital anomalies like septal defects and patent
ductus arteriosus
vii) Conditions with increased cardiac output e.g. thyro-
toxicosis, anaemia, arteriovenous fistulae.
Right ventricular hypertrophy. Most of the causes of right
ventricular hypertrophy are due to pulmonary arterial
hypertension. These are as follows:
i)
Pulmonary stenosis and insufficiency
ii) Tricuspid insufficiency
iii) Mitral stenosis and/or insufficiency
iv) Chronic lung diseases e.g. chronic emphysema,
bronchiectasis, pneumoconiosis, pulmonary vascular disease
etc.
v) Left ventricular hypertrophy and failure of the left
ventricle.
Cardiac Dilatation
Quite often, hypertrophy of the heart is accompanied by
cardiac dilatation. Stress leading to accumulation of excessive
volume of blood in a chamber of the heart causes increase in
length of myocardial fibres and hence cardiac dilatation as a
compensatory mechanism.
CAUSES. Accumulation of excessive volume of blood within
the cardiac chambers from the following causes may result
in dilatation of the respective ventricles or both:
i)
Valvular insufficiency (mitral and/or aortic insufficiency
in left ventricular dilatation, tricuspid and/or pulmonary
insufficiency in right ventricular dilatation)
ii) Left-to-right shunts e.g. in VSD
iii) Conditions with high cardiac output e.g. thyrotoxicosis,
arteriovenous shunt
iv) Myocardial diseases e.g. cardiomyopathies, myocarditis
v) Systemic hypertension.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Hypertrophy of the myo-
cardium without dilatation is referred to as concentric, and
when associated with dilatation is called eccentric
Figure 16.4
Schematic pathophysiology of compensatory mechanisms in cardiac failure.

422
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
(Fig. 16.5). The weight of the heart is increased above
normal, often over 500 gm. However, excessive epicar-
dial fat is not indicative of true hypertrophy.
Grossly, Thickness of the left ventricular wall (excluding
trabeculae carneae and papillary muscles) above 15 mm
is indicative of significant hypertrophy. In concentric
hypertrophy, the lumen of the chamber is smaller than
usual, while in eccentric hypertrophy the lumen is dilated
(Fig. 16.6). In pure hypertrophy, the papillary muscles and
trabeculae carneae are rounded and enlarged, while in
hypertrophy with dilatation these are flattened.
Microscopically, there is increase in size of individual
muscle fibres. There may be multiple minute foci of
degenerative changes and necrosis in the hypertrophied
myocardium (Fig. 16.7). These changes appear to arise as
a result of relative hypoxia of the hypertrophied muscle
as the blood supply is inadequate to meet the demands of
the increased fibre size. Ventricular hypertrophy renders
the inner part of the myocardium more liable to ischaemia.
Electron microscopy reveals increase in the number of
myofilaments comprising myofibrils, mitochondrial
changes and multiple intercalated discs which are active
sites for the formation of new sarcomeres. Besides, the
nucleic acid content determinations have shown increase
in total RNA and increased ratio of RNA to DNA content
of the hypertrophied myocardial fibres.
CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE
Congenital heart disease is the abnormality of the heart
present from birth. It is the most common and important
form of heart disease in the early years of life and is present
in about 0.5% of newborn children. The incidence is higher
in premature infants. The cause of congenital heart disease
is unknown in majority of cases. It is attributed to multi-
factorial inheritance involving genetic and environmental
influences. Other factors like rubella infection to the mother
during pregnancy, drugs taken by the mother and heavy
alcohol drinking by the mother, have all been implicated in
causing in utero foetal injury resulting in congenital
malformations of the heart.
CLASSIFICATION. Congenital anomalies of the heart may
be either shunts (left-to-right or right-to-left), or defects
causing obstructions to flow. However, complex anomalies

423
CHAPTER 16
The Heart
involving combinations of shunts and obstructions are also
often present.
A simple classification of important and common exam-
ples of these groups is given in Table 16.1.
I.  MALPOSITIONS OF THE HEART
Dextrocardia is the condition when the apex of the heart points
to the right side of the chest. It may be accompanied by situs
inversus so that all other organs of the body are also
transposed in similar way and thus heart is in normal position
in relation to them. However, isolated dextrocardia is
associated with major anomalies of the heart such as
transposition of the atria in relation to ventricles or
transposition of the great arteries.
II.  SHUNTS (CYANOTIC CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE)
A shunt may be left-to-right side or right-to-left side of the
circulation.
A. Left-to-Right Shunts
(Acyanotic or Late Cyanotic Group)
In conditions where there is shunting of blood from left-to-
right side of the heart, there is volume overload on the right
heart producing pulmonary hypertension and right
ventricular hypertrophy. At a later stage, the pressure on
the right side is higher than on the left side creating late
cyanotic heart disease. The important conditions included
in this category are described below:
VENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT (VSD). VSD is the most
common congenital anomaly of the heart and comprises
about 30% of all congenital heart diseases. The condition is
recognised early in life. The smaller defects often close
spontaneously, while larger defects remain patent and
produce significant effects.
Depending upon the location of the defect, VSD may be
of the following types:
1.
In 90% of cases, the defect involves membranous septum
and is very close to the bundle of His (Fig. 16.8).
2.
The remaining 10% cases have VSD immediately below
the pulmonary valve (subpulmonic), below the aortic valve
(subaortic), or exist in the form of multiple defects in the
muscular septum.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The effects of VSD are
produced due to left-to-right shunt at the ventricular level,
increased pulmonary flow and increased volume in the
left side of the heart. These effects are as under:
i)
Volume hypertrophy of the right ventricle.
ii) Enlargement and haemodynamic changes in the
tricuspid and pulmonary valves.
iii) Endocardial hypertrophy of the right ventricle.
iv) Pressure hypertrophy of the right atrium.
v) Volume hypertrophy of the left atrium and left
ventricle.
vi)  Enlargement and haemodynamic changes in the mitral
and aortic valves.
ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT (ASD). Isolated ASD comprises
about 10% of congenital heart diseases. The condition
remains unnoticed in infancy and childhood till pulmonary
hypertension is induced causing late cyanotic heart disease
and right-sided heart failure.
Depending upon the location of the defect, there are
3 types of ASD:
i)
Fossa ovalis type or ostium secundum type is the most
common form comprising about 90% cases of ASD. The
defect is situated in the region of the fossa ovalis (Fig. 16.9).
ii) Ostium primum type comprises about 5% cases of ASD.
The defect lies low in the interatrial septum adjacent to
atrioventricular valves. There may be cleft in the aortic leaflet
of the mitral valve producing mitral insufficiency.
iii) Sinus venosus type accounts for about 5% cases of ASD.
The defect is located high in the interatrial septum near the
entry of the superior vena cava.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The effects of ASD are
produced due to left-to-right shunt at the atrial level with
increased pulmonary flow. These effects are as follows:
i)
Volume hypertrophy of the right atrium and right
ventricle.
ii) Enlargement and haemodynamic changes of tricuspid
and pulmonary valves.
iii) Focal or diffuse endocardial hypertrophy of the right
atrium and right ventricle.
iv) Volume atrophy of the left atrium and left ventricle.
v) Small-sized mitral and aortic orifices.
PATENT DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS (PDA). The ductus
arteriosus is a normal vascular connection between the aorta
and the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery. Normally, the
ductus closes functionally within the first or second day of
life. Its persistence after 3 months of age is considered
abnormal. The cause for patency of ductus arteriosus is not
known but possibly it is due to continued synthesis of PGE2
after birth which keeps it patent as evidenced by association
of PDA with respiratory distress syndrome in infants and
pharmacologic closure of PDA with administration of indo-
methacin to suppress PGE2 synthesis. PDA constitutes about
10% of congenital malformations of the heart and great
vessels. In about 90% of cases, it occurs as an isolated defect,
while in the remaining cases it may be associated with other
anomalies like VSD, coarctation of aorta and pulmonary or
aortic stenosis. A patent ductus may be upto 2 cm in length
and upto 1 cm in diameter (Fig. 16.10).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The effects of PDA on heart
occur due to left-to-right shunt at the level of ductus
resulting in increased pulmonary flow and increased
volume in the left heart. These effects are as follows:
i)
Volume hypertrophy of the left atrium and left
ventricle.
ii) Enlargement and haemodynamic changes of the mitral
and pulmonary valves.
iii) Enlargement of the ascending aorta.
B. Right-to-Left Shunts (Cyanotic Group)
In conditions where there is shunting of blood from right
side to the left side of the heart, there is entry of poorly-
oxygenated blood into systemic circulation resulting in early
cyanosis. The examples described below are not pure shunts
but are combinations of shunts with obstructions but are

CHAPTER 16
The Heart
described here since there is functional shunting of blood
from one to the other side of circulation.
TETRALOGY OF FALLOT. Tetralogy of Fallot is the most
common cyanotic congenital heart disease, found in about
10% of children with anomalies of the heart.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The four features of
tetralogy are as under (Fig. 16.11):
i)
Ventricular septal defect (VSD) (‘shunt’).
ii) Displacement of the aorta to right so that it overrides
the VSD.
iii) Pulmonary stenosis (‘obstruction’).
iv) Right ventricular hypertrophy.
The severity of the clinical manifestations is related to
two factors: extent of pulmonary stenosis and the size of VSD.
Accordingly, there are two forms of tetralogy: cyanotic and
acyanotic:
a) Cyanotic tetralogy: Pulmonary stenosis is greater and the
VSD is mild so that there is more resistance to the outflow of
blood from right ventricle resulting in right-to-left shunt at
the ventricular level and cyanosis. The effects on the heart
are as follows:
i)
Pressure hypertrophy of the right atrium and right
ventricle.
ii) Smaller and abnormal tricuspid valve.
iii) Smaller left atrium and left ventricle.
iv) Enlarged aortic orifice.
b) Acyanotic tetralogy:  The VSD is larger and pulmonary
stenosis is mild so that there is mainly left-to-right shunt with
increased pulmonary flow and increased volume in the left
heart but no cyanosis. The effects on the heart are as under:
i)
Pressure hypertrophy of the right ventricle and right
atrium.
ii) Volume hypertrophy of the left atrium and left ventricle.
iii) Enlargement of mitral and aortic orifices.
TRANSPOSITION OF GREAT ARTERIES. The term
transposition is used for complex malformations as regards
position of the aorta, pulmonary trunk, atrioventricular
orifices and the position of atria in relation to ventricles.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. There are several forms of
transpositions. The common ones are described below:
i)
Regular transposition is the most common type. In this,
the aorta which is normally situated to the right and
posterior with respect to the pulmonary trunk, is instead
displaced anteriorly and to right. In regular complete
transposition, the aorta emerges from the right ventricle
and the pulmonary trunk from the left ventricle so that
there is cyanosis from birth.
ii) Corrected transposition is an uncommon anomaly.
There is complete transposition of the great arteries with
aorta arising from the right ventricle and the pulmonary
trunk from the left ventricle, as well as transposition of the
great veins so that the pulmonary veins enter the right
atrium and the systemic veins drain into the left atrium.
This results in a physiologically corrected circulation.
PERSISTENT TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS. Persistent
truncus arteriosus (PTA) is a rare anomaly.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  In PTA, the arch that
normally separates the aorta from the pulmonary artery
fails to develop. This results in a single large common
vessel receiving blood from the right as well as left
ventricle. The orifice may have 3 to 6 cusps. There is often
an associated VSD. There is left-to-right shunt and
frequently early systemic cyanosis. The prognosis is
generally poor.
TRICUSPID ATRESIA AND STENOSIS. Tricuspid atresia
and stenosis are rare anomalies. There is often associated
pulmonary stenosis or pulmonary atresia.

426
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. In tricuspid atresia, there
is absence of tricuspid orifice and instead there is a dimple
in the floor of the right atrium. In tricuspid stenosis, the
tricuspid ring is small and the valve cusps are malformed.
In both the conditions, there is often an interatrial defect
through which right-to-left shunt of blood takes place.
Children are cyanotic since birth and live for a few weeks
or months.
III. OBSTRUCTIONS
(OBSTRUCTIVE CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE)
Congenital obstruction to blood flow may result from
obstruction in the aorta due to narrowing (coarctation of aorta),
obstruction to outflow from the left ventricle (aortic stenosis
and atresia), and obstruction to outflow from the right
ventricle (pulmonary stenosis and atresia).
COARCTATION OF AORTA. The word ‘coarctation’
means contracted or compressed. Coarctation of aorta is
localised narrowing in any part of aorta, but the constriction
is more often just distal to ductus arteriosus (postductal or
adult), or occasionally proximal to the ductus arteriosus
(preductal or infantile type) in the region of transverse aorta:
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The two common forms of
coarrctation of the aorta are as under:
i) Postductal or adult type: The obstruction is just distal
to the point of entry of ductus arteriosus which is often
closed (Fig. 16.12). In the stenotic segment, the aorta is
drawn in as if a suture has been tied around it. The aorta
is dilated on either side of the constriction. The condition
is recognised in adulthood, characterised by hypertension
in the upper extremities, weak pulses and low blood
pressure in the lower extremities and effects of arterial
insufficiency such as claudication and coldness. In time,
there is development of collateral circulation between pre-
stenotic and post-stenotic arterial branches so that
intercostal arteries are enlarged and palpable and may
produce erosions on the inner surface of the ribs.
ii) Preductal or infantile type: The manifestations are
produced early in life. The narrowing is proximal to the
ductus arteriosus which usually remains patent. The
narrowing is generally gradual and involves larger
segment of the proximal aorta. There is often associated
interatrial septal defect. Preductal coarctation results in
right ventricular hypertrophy while the left ventricle is
small. Cyanosis develops in the lower half of the body
while the upper half remains unaffected since it is supp-
lied by vessels originating proximal to the coarctation.
Children with this defect have poor prognosis.
AORTIC STENOSIS AND ATRESIA. The most common
congenital anomaly of the aorta is bicuspid aortic valve which
does not have much functional significance but predisposes
it to calcification (page 450). Congenital aortic atresia is rare
and incompatible with survival. Aortic stenosis may be
acquired (e.g. in rheumatic heart disease, calcific aortic
stenosis) or congenital.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Congenital aortic stenosis
may be of three types: valvular, subvalvular and
supravalvular.
i)
Valvular stenosis: The aortic valve cusps are
malformed and are irregularly thickened. The aortic valve
may have one, two or three such maldeveloped cusps.
ii) Subvalvular stenosis: There is thick fibrous ring under
the aortic valve causing subaortic stenosis.
iii) Supravalvular stenosis: The most uncommon type,
there is fibrous constriction above the sinuses of Valsalva.
In all these cases, there is pressure hypertrophy of the
left ventricle and left atrium, and dilatation of the aortic root.
PULMONARY STENOSIS AND ATRESIA. Isolated
pulmonary stenosis and atresia do not cause cyanosis and
hence are included under acyanotic heart diseases.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The changes in these
conditions are as under:
Pulmonary stenosis: It is the commonest form of
obstructive congenital heart disease comprising about 7%
of all congenital heart diseases. It may occur as a compo-
nent of tetralogy of Fallot or as an isolated defect.
Pulmonary stenosis is caused by fusion of cusps of the
pulmonary valve forming a diaphragm-like obstruction to
the outflow of blood from the right ventricle and dilatation
of the pulmonary trunk.
Pulmonary atresia: There is no communication between
the right ventricle and lungs so that the blood bypasses
the right ventricle through an interatrial septal defect. It
then enters the lungs via patent ductus arteriosus.

CHAPTER 16
The Heart
ISCHAEMIC HEART DISEASE
Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) is defined as acute or chronic
form of cardiac disability arising from imbalance between
the myocardial supply and demand for oxygenated blood.
Since narrowing or obstruction of the coronary arterial
system is the most common cause of myocardial anoxia, the
alternate term ‘coronary artery disease (CAD)’ is used
synonymously with IHD. IHD or CAD is the leading cause
of death in most developed countries (about one-third of all
deaths) and somewhat low incidence is observed in the
developing countries. Men develop IHD earlier than women
and death rates are also slightly higher for men than for
women until the menopause. As per rising trends of IHD
worldwide, it is estimated that by the year 2020 it would
become the most common cause of death throughout world.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS
IHD is invariably caused by disease affecting the coronary
arteries, the most prevalent being atherosclerosis accounting
for more than 90% cases, while other causes are responsible
for less than 10% cases of IHD. Therefore, it is convenient to
consider the etiology of IHD under three broad headings:
i)
coronary atherosclerosis;
ii) superadded changes in coronary atherosclerosis; and
iii) non-atherosclerotic causes.
I.
Coronary Atherosclerosis
Coronary atherosclerosis resulting in ‘fixed’ obstruction is
the major cause of IHD in more than 90% cases. The general
aspects of atherosclerosis as regards its etiology, pathogenesis
and the morphologic features of atherosclerotic lesions have
already been dealt with at length in the preceding Chapter
15. Here, a brief account of the specific features in pathology
of lesions in atherosclerotic coronary artery disease in particular
are presented.
1.
Distribution. Atherosclerotic lesions in coronary arteries
are distributed in one or more of the three major coronary
arterial trunks, the highest incidence being in the anterior
descending branch of the left coronary, followed in
decreasing frequency, by the right coronary artery and still
less in circumflex branch of the left coronary. About one-
third of cases have single-vessel disease, most often left anterior
descending arterial involvement; another one-third have two-
vessel disease, and the remainder have three major vessel disease.
2.
Location. Almost all adults show atherosclerotic plaques
scattered throughout the coronary arterial system. However,
significant stenotic lesions that may produce chronic
myocardial ischaemia show more than 75% (three-fourth)
reduction in the cross-sectional area of a coronary artery or
its branch. The area of severest involvement is about 3 to 4
cm from the coronary ostia, more often at or near the bifurca-
tion of the arteries, suggesting the role of haemodynamic
forces in atherogenesis.
3.
Fixed atherosclerotic plaques. The atherosclerotic
plaques in the coronaries are more often eccentrically located
bulging into the lumen from one side (Fig. 16.13). Occa-
sionally, there may be concentric thickening of the wall of
the artery. Atherosclerosis produces gradual luminal
narrowing that may eventually lead to ‘fixed’ coronary
obstruction. The general features of atheromas of coronary
arteries are similar to those affecting elsewhere in the body
and may develop similar complications like calcification,
coronary thrombosis, ulceration, haemorrhage, rupture and
aneurysm formation.
II. Superadded Changes in Coronary Atherosclerosis
The attacks of acute coronary syndromes, which include acute
myocardial infarction, unstable angina and sudden ischaemic
death, are precipitated by certain changes superimposed on
a pre-existing fixed coronary atheromatous plaque. These
changes are as under:
1.
Acute changes in chronic atheromatous plaque. Though
chronic fixed obstructions are the most frequent cause of IHD,
acute coronary episodes are often precipitated by sudden
changes in chronic plaques such as plaque haemorrhage,
fissuring, or ulceration that results in thrombosis and
embolisation of atheromatous debris. Acute plaque changes
are brought about by factors such as sudden coronary artery
spasm, tachycardia, intraplaque haemorrhage and hyper-
cholesterolaemia.
2.
Coronary artery thrombosis. Transmural acute myocar-
dial infarction is often precipitated by partial or complete
coronary thrombosis. The initiation of thrombus occurs due
to surface ulceration of fixed chronic atheromatous plaque,
ultimately causing complete luminal occlusion. The lipid core
of plaque, in particular, is highly thrombogenic. Small
fragments of thrombotic material are then dislodged which
are embolised to terminal coronary branches and cause
microinfarcts of the myocardium.

showing critical narrowing with  eccentric luminal obliteration due to
complicated atheromatous plaque.

428
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
3.
Local platelet aggregation and coronary artery spasm.
Some cases of acute coronary episodes are caused by local
aggregates of platelets on the atheromatous plaque, short of
forming a thrombus. The aggregated platelets release
vasospasmic mediators such as thromboxane A2 which may
probably be responsible for coronary vasospasm in the
already atherosclerotic vessel.
Based on progressive pathological changes and clinical
correlation, American Heart Association (1995) has classified
human coronary atherosclerosis into 6 sequential types in
ascending order of grades of lesions as shown in Table 16.2.
III. Non-atherosclerotic Causes
Several other coronary lesions may cause IHD in less than
10% of cases. These are as under:
1.
Vasospasm. It has been possible to document vasospasm
of one of the major coronary arterial trunks in patients with
no significant atherosclerotic coronary narrowing which may
cause angina or myocardial infarction.
2.
Stenosis of coronary ostia. Coronary ostial narrowing
may result from extension of syphilitic aortitis or from aortic
atherosclerotic plaques encroaching on the opening.
3.
Arteritis. Various types of inflammatory involvements
of coronary arteries or small branches like in rheumatic
arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, thrombo-angiitis obliterans
(Buerger’s disease), Takayasu’s disease, Kawasaki’s disease,
tuberculosis and other bacterial infections may contribute to
myocardial damage.
4.
Embolism. Rarely, emboli originating from elsewhere in
the body may occlude the left coronary artery and its
branches and produce IHD. The emboli may originate from
bland thrombi, or from vegetations of bacterial endocarditis;
rarely fat embolism and air embolism of coronary circulation
may occur.
5.
Thrombotic diseases. Another infrequent cause of coro-
nary occlusion is from hypercoagulability of the blood such
as in shock, polycythaemia vera, sickle cell anaemia and
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
6.
Trauma. Contusion of a coronary artery from penetrating
injuries may produce thrombotic occlusion.
7.
Aneurysms. Extension of dissecting aneurysm of the
aorta into the coronary artery may produce thrombotic
coronary occlusion. Rarely, congenital, mycotic and syphi-
litic aneurysms may occur in coronary arteries and produce
similar occlusive effects.
8.
Compression. Compression of a coronary from outside
by a primary or secondary tumour of the heart may result in
coronary occlusion.
EFFECTS OF MYOCARDIAL ISCHAEMIA
Development of lesions in the coronaries is not always
accompanied by cardiac disease. Depending upon the
suddenness of onset, duration, degree, location and extent
of the area affected by myocardial ischaemia, the range of
changes and clinical features may vary from an asympto-
matic state at one extreme to immediate mortality at another
(Fig. 16.14):
A. Asymptomatic state
B. Angina pectoris (AP)
C. Acute myocardial infarction (MI)
D. Chronic ischaemic heart disease (CIHD)/ Ischaemic
cardiomyopathy/ Myocardial fibrosis
E. Sudden cardiac death
The term acute coronary syndromes include a triad of acute
myocardial infarction, unstable angina and sudden cardiac
death.

CHAPTER 16
The Heart
ANGINA PECTORIS
Angina pectoris is a clinical syndrome of IHD resulting from
transient myocardial ischaemia. It is characterised by
paroxysmal pain in the substernal or precordial region of
the chest which is aggravated by an increase in the demand
of the heart and relieved by a decrease in the work of the
heart. Often, the pain radiates to the left arm, neck, jaw or
right arm. It is more common in men past 5th decade of life.
There are 3 overlapping clinical patterns of angina
pectoris with some differences in their pathogenesis:
i)
Stable or typical angina
ii) Prinzmetal’s variant angina
iii) Unstable or crescendo angina
STABLE OR TYPICAL ANGINA. This is the most common
pattern. Stable or typical angina is characterised by attacks
of pain following physical exertion or emotional excitement
and is relieved by rest. The pathogenesis of condition lies in
chronic stenosing coronary atherosclerosis that cannot perfuse
the myocardium adequately when the workload on the heart
increases. During the attacks, there is depression of ST
segment in the ECG due to poor perfusion of the
subendocardial region of the left ventricle but there is no
elevation of enzymes in the blood as there is no irreversible
myocardial injury.
PRINZMETAL’S VARIANT ANGINA. This pattern of
angina is characterised by pain at rest and has no relation-
ship with physical activity. The exact pathogenesis of
Prinzmetal’s angina is not known. It may occur due to sudden
vasospasm of a coronary trunk induced by coronary
atherosclerosis, or may be due to release of humoral
vasoconstrictors by mast cells in the coronary adventitia. ECG
shows ST segment elevation due to transmural ischaemia.
These patients respond well to vasodilators like nitroglycerin.
UNSTABLE OR CRESCENDO ANGINA. Also referred to
as ‘pre-infarction angina’ or ‘acute coronary insufficiency’,
this is the most serious pattern of angina. It is characterised
by more frequent onset of pain of prolonged duration and
occurring often at rest. It is thus indicative of an impending
acute myocardial infarction. Distinction between unstable
angina and acute MI is made by ST segment changes on
ECG— acute MI characterised by ST segment elevation while
unstable angina  may have non-ST segment elevation MI.
Multiple factors are involved in the pathogenesis of unstable
angina which include: stenosing coronary atherosclerosis,
complicated coronary plaques (e.g. superimposed
thrombosis, haemorrhage, rupture, ulceration etc), platelet
thrombi over atherosclerotic plaques and vasospasm of
coronary arteries. More often, the lesions lie in a branch of
the major coronary trunk so that collaterals prevent
infarction.
ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is the most important and
feared consequence of coronary artery disease. Many patients
may die within the first few hours of the onset, while
remainder suffer from effects of impaired cardiac function.
A significant factor that may prevent or diminish the
myocardial damage is the development of collateral
circulation through anastomotic channels over a period of
time. A regular and well-planned exercise programme
encourages good collateral circulation and improved cardiac
performance.
INCIDENCE. In developed countries, acute MI accounts for
10-25% of all deaths. Due to the dominant etiologic role of
coronary atherosclerosis in acute MI, the incidence of acute
MI correlates well with the incidence of atherosclerosis in a
geographic area.
Age. Acute MI may virtually occur at all ages, though the
incidence is higher in the elderly. About 5% of heart attacks
occur in young people under the age of 40 years, particularly
in those with major risk factors to develop atherosclerosis
like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking and
dyslipidaemia with familial hypercholesterolaemia.
Sex. Males throughout their life are at a significantly higher
risk of developing acute MI as compared to females. Women
during reproductive period have remarkably low incidence
of acute MI, probably due to the protective influence of
oestrogen. The use of oral contraceptives is associated with
high risk of developing acute MI. After menopause, this sex
difference gradually declines but the incidence of disease
among women never reaches that among men of the same
age.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The etiologic role of severe coro-
nary atherosclerosis (more than 75% compromise of lumen)
of one or more of the three major coronary arterial trunks in
the pathogenesis of about 90% cases of acute MI is well
documented by autopsy studies as well as by coronary angio-
graphic studies. A few notable features in the development
of acute MI are as under:
Figure 16.14
Spectrum of coronary ischaemic manifestations.

430
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
1.
Myocardial ischaemia. Myocardial ischaemia is brought
about by one or more of the following mechanisms:
i)
Diminised coronary blood flow e.g. in coronary artery
disease, shock.
ii) Increased myocardial demand e.g. in exercise, emotions.
iii) Hypertrophy of the heart without simultaneous increase
of coronary blood flow e.g. in hypertension, valvular heart
disease.
2.
Role of platelets. Rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque
exposes the subendothelial collagen to platelets which
undergo aggregation, activation and release reaction. These
events contribute to the build-up of the platelet mass that
may give rise to emboli or initiate thrombosis.
3.
Acute plaque rupture. In general, slowly-developing
coronary ischaemia from stenosing coronary atherosclerosis
of high-grade may not cause acute MI but continue to
produce episodes of angina pectoris. But acute complications
in coronary atherosclerotic plaques in the form of
superimposed coronary thrombosis due to plaque rupture
and plaque haemorrhage is frequently encountered in cases
of acute MI:
i)
Superimposed coronary thrombosis due to disruption of
plaque is seen in about half the cases of acute MI. Infusion of
intracoronary fibrinolysins in the first half an hour of
development of acute MI in such cases restores blood flow
in the blocked vessel in majority of cases.
ii) Intramural haemorrhage is found in about one-third cases
of acute MI.
Plaque haemorrhage and thrombosis may occur together
in some cases.
4.
Non-atherosclerotic causes. About 10% cases of acute MI
are caused by non-atherosclerotic factors such as coronary
vasospasm, arteritis, coronary ostial stenosis, embolism,
thrombotic diseases, trauma and outside compression as
already described.
5.
Transmural versus subendocardial infarcts. There are
some differences in the pathogenesis of the transmural infarcts
involving the full thickness of ventricular wall and the
subendocardial (laminar) infarcts affecting the inner
subendocardial one-third to half. These are as under
(Table 16.3):
i)
Transmural (full thickness) infarcts are the most common
type seen in 95% cases. Critical coronary narrowing (more
than 75% compromised lumen) is of great significance in the
causation of such infarcts. Atherosclerotic plaques with
superimposed thrombosis and intramural haemorrhage are
significant in about 90% cases, and non-atherosclerotic causes
in the remaining 10% cases.
ii) Subendocardial (laminar) infarcts have their genesis in
reduced coronary perfusion due to coronary atherosclerosis
but without critical stenosis (not necessarily 75% compro-
mised lumen), aortic stenosis or haemorrhagic shock. This is
because subendocardial myocardium is normally least well
perfused by coronaries and thus is more vulnerable to any
reduction in the coronary flow. Superimposed coronary
thrombosis is frequently encountered in these cases too, and
hence the beneficial role of fibrinolytic treatment in such
patients.
TYPES OF INFARCTS. Infarcts have been classified in a
number of ways by the physicians and the pathologists:
1.
According to the anatomic region of the left ventricle invol-
ved, they are called anterior, posterior (inferior), lateral, septal
and circumferential, and their combinations like antero-
lateral, posterolateral (or inferolateral) and anteroseptal.
2.
According to the degree of thickness of the ventricular wall
involved, infarcts are of two types (Fig. 16.15):
i)
Full-thickness or transmural, when they involve the entire
thickness of the ventricular wall.
ii) Subendocardial or laminar, when they occupy the inner
subendocardial half of the myocardium.
3.
According to the age of infarcts, they are of two types:
i)
Newly-formed infarcts called as acute, recent or fresh.
ii) Advanced infarcts called as old, healed or organised.
LOCATION OF INFARCTS. Infarcts are most frequently
located in the left ventricle. Right ventricle is less susceptible
to infarction due to its thin wall, having less metabolic
requirements and is thus adequately nourished by the
thebesian vessels. Atrial infarcts, whenever present, are more
often in the right atrium, usually accompanying the infarct
of the left ventricle. Left atrium is relatively protected from
infarction because it is supplied by the oxygenated blood in
the left atrial chamber.
The region of infarction depends upon the area of
obstructed blood supply by one or more of the three coro-
nary arterial trunks. Accordingly, there are three regions of
myocardial infarction (Fig. 16.16):

CHAPTER 16
The Heart
1.
Stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery is the
most common (40-50%). The region of infarction is the
anterior part of the left ventricle including the apex and the
anterior two-thirds of the interventricular septum.
2. Stenosis of the right coronary artery is the next most
frequent (30-40%). It involves the posterior part of the left
ventricle and the posterior one-third of the interventricular
septum.
3.
Stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery is seen least
frequently (15-20%). Its area of involvement is the lateral wall
of the left ventricle.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The gross and microscopic
changes in the myocardial infarction vary according to
the age of the infarct and are therefore described
sequentially (Table 16.4).

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Grossly, most infarcts occur singly and vary in size from
4 to 10 cm. As explained above, they are found most often
in the left ventricle. Less often, there are multifocal lesions.
The transmural infarcts, which by definition involve the
entire thickness of the ventricular wall, usually have a thin
rim of preserved subendocardial myocardium which is
perfused directly by the blood in the ventricular chamber.
The subendocardial infarcts which affect the inner sub-
endocardial half of the myocardium produce less well-
defined gross changes than the transmural infarcts. The
sequence of macroscopic changes in all myocardial infarcts
is as under:
1.
In 6 to 12 hours old infarcts, no striking gross changes
are discernible except that the affected myocardium is
slightly paler and drier than normal. However, the early
infarcts (3 to 6 hours old) can be detected by histochemical
staining for dehydrogenases on unfixed slice of the heart.
This consists of immersing a slice of unfixed heart in the
solution of triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) which
imparts red brown colour to the normal heart muscle,
while the area of infarcted muscle fails to stain due to lack
of dehydrogenases. Another stain for viability of cardiac
muscle is nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) dye which imparts
blue colour to unaffected cardiac muscle while infarcted
myocardium remains unstained.
2.
By about 24 hours, the infarct develops cyanotic, red-
purple, blotchy areas of haemorrhage due to stagnation
of blood.
3.
During the next 48 to 72 hours, the infarct develops a
yellow border due to neutrophilic infiltration and thus
becomes more well-defined.
4.
In 3-7 days, the infarct has hyperaemic border while
the centre is yellow and soft.
5.
By 10 days, the periphery of the infarct appears reddish-
purple due to growth of granulation tissue. With the
passage of time, further healing takes place; the necrotic
muscle is resorbed and the infarct shrinks and becomes
pale grey.
6.
By the end of 6 weeks, the infarcted area is replaced by a
thin, grey-white, hard, shrunken fibrous scar which is well
developed in about 2 to 3 months. However, the time taken
by an infarct to heal by fibrous scar may vary depending
upon the size of the infarct and adequacy of collateral
circulation (Fig. 16.17).
Microscopically, the changes are similar in both trans-
mural and subendocardial infarcts. As elsewhere in the
body, myocardial ischaemia induces ischaemic
coagulative necrosis of the myocardium which eventually
heals by fibrosis. However, sequential light microscopic
changes are observed as described below and
diagrammatically shown in Fig. 16.18.
1.
First week: The progression of changes takes place in
the following way:
i)
In the first 6 hours after infarction, usually no detec-
table histologic change is observed in routine light micros-
copy. However, some investigators have described
stretching and waviness of the myocardial fibres within
one hour of the onset of ischaemia.
ii) After 6 hours, there is appearance of some oedema fluid
between the myocardial fibres. The muscle fibres at the
margin of the infarct show vacuolar degeneration called
myocytolysis.
iii) By 12 hours, coagulative necrosis of the myocardial
fibres sets in and neutrophils begin to appear at the margin
of the infarct. Coagulative necrosis of fibres is
characterised by loss of striations and intense eosinophilic,
hyaline appearance and may show nuclear changes like
karyolysis, pyknosis and karyorrhexis. Haemorrhages and
oedema are present in the interstitium.
iv) During the first 24 hours, coagulative necrosis pro-
gresses further as evidenced by shrunken eosinophilic
cytoplasm and pyknosis of the nuclei. The neutrophilic
infiltrate at the margins of the infarct is slight.
v) During the first 48 to 72 hours, coagulative necrosis is
complete with loss of nuclei. The neutrophilic infiltrate is
well developed and extends centrally into the interstitium.
vi) In 3-7 days, neutrophils are necrosed and gradually
disappear. The process of resorption of necrosed muscle
fibres by macrophages begins. Simultaneously, there is
onset of proliferation of capillaries and fibroblasts from
the margins of the infarct (Fig. 16.19).
2.
Second week: The changes are as under:
i)
By 10th day, most of the necrosed muscle at the peri-
phery of infarct is removed. The fibrovascular reaction at
the margin of infarct is more prominent. Many pigmented
macrophages containing yellow-brown lipofuscin
(derived from breakdown of myocardial cells) and golden
brown haemosiderin (derived from lysed erythrocytes in
haemorrhagic areas) are seen. Also present are a few other
inflammatory cells like eosinophils, lymphocytes and
plasma cells.
ii) By the end of the 2nd week, most of the necrosed muscle
in small infarcts is removed, neutrophils have almost
disappeared, and newly laid collagen fibres replace the
periphery of the infarct.

shows grey white thinning of myocardium at the apex  (arrow) due to
healed fibrous scarring.

CHAPTER 16
The Heart
3.
Third week: Necrosed muscle fibres from larger
infarcts continue to be removed and replaced by ingrowth
of newly formed collagen fibres. Pigmented macrophages
as well as lymphocytes and plasma cells are prominent
while eosinophils gradually disappear.
Figure 16.18
Sequence of light microscopic changes in myocardial
infarction.(For details, consult the text).
Figure 16.19
Old myocardial infarct. The infarcted area shows
ingrowth of inflammatory granulation tissue.
4.
Fourth to sixth week: With further removal of necrotic
tissue, there is increase in collagenous connective tissue,
decreased vascularity and fewer pigmented macrophages,
lymphocytes and plasma cells. Thus, at the end of 6 weeks,
a contracted fibrocollagenic scar with diminished
vascularity is formed. The pigmented macrophages may
persist for a long duration in the scar, sometimes for years.
A summary of the sequence of gross and microscopic
changes in myocardial infarction of varying duration is
presented in Table 16.4.
SALVAGE IN EARLY INFARCTS AND REPERFUSION
INJURY. In vast majority of cases of acute MI, occlusive
coronary artery thrombosis has been demonstrated
superimposed on fibrofatty plaque. The ischaemic injury
to myocardium is reversible if perfusion is restored within
the first 30 minutes of onset of infarction failing which
irreversible ischaemic necrosis of myocardium sets in. The
salvage in early infarcts can be achieved by the following
interventions:
1.
Institution of thrombolytic therapy with thrombolytic
agents such as streptokinase and tissue plasminogen
activator (door-to-needle time  <30 minutes).
2.
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).
3.
Coronary artery stenting.
4.
Coronary artery bypass surgery.
However, attempt at reperfusion is fraught with the
risk of ischaemic reperfusion injury (Chapter 3).  Further
myonecrosis during reperfusion occurs due to rapid influx
of calcium ions and generation of toxic oxygen free
radicals.
Grossly, the myocardial infarct following reperfusion
injury appears haemorrhagic rather than pale.
Microscopically, myofibres show contraction band necrosis
which are transverse and thick eosinophilic bands.

434
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
CHANGES IN EARLY INFARCTS. By special techniques
like electron microscopy, chemical and histochemical studies,
changes can be demonstrated in early infarcts before
detectable light microscopic alterations appear.
1.
Electron microscopic changes. Changes by EM
examination are evident in less than half an hour on onset of
infarction. These changes are as under:
i)
Disappearance of perinuclear glycogen granules within
5 minutes of ischaemia.
ii) Swelling of mitochondria in 20 to 30 minutes.
iii) Disruption of sarcolemma.
iv) Nuclear alterations like peripheral clumping of nuclear
chromatin.
2.
Chemical and histochemical changes. Analysis of tissues
from early infarcts by chemical and histochemical techniques
has shown a number of findings. These are as follows:
i)
Glycogen depletion in myocardial fibres within 30 to 60
minutes of infarction.
ii) Increase in lactic acid in the myocardial fibres.
iii) Loss of K+ from the ischaemic fibres.
iv) Increase of Na+ in the ischaemic cells.
v) Influx of Ca++ into the cells causing irreversible cell injury.
Based on the above observations and on leakage of
enzymes from the ischaemic myocardium, alterations in the
concentrations of various enzymes are detected in the blood
of these patients.
DIAGNOSIS. The diagnosis of acute MI is made on the
observations of 3 types of features—clinical features, ECG
changes, and serum enzyme determinations.
1.
Clinical features. Typically, acute MI has a sudden onset.
The following clinical features usually characterise a case of
acute MI.
i)
Pain: Usually sudden, severe, crushing and prolonged,
substernal or precordial in location, unrelieved by rest or
nitroglycerin, often radiating to one or both the arms, neck
and back.
ii) Indigestion: Pain is often accompanied by epigastric or
substernal discomfort interpreted as ‘heartburn’ with nausea
and vomiting.
iii) Apprehension: The patient is often terrified, restless and
apprehensive due to great fear of death.
iv) Shock: Systolic blood pressure is below 80 mmHg;
lethargy, cold clammy limbs, peripheral cyanosis, weak
pulse, tachycardia or bradycardia are often present.
v) Oliguria: Urine flow is usually less than 20 ml per hour.
vi) Low grade fever: Mild rise in temperature occurs within
24 hours and lasts up to one week, accompanied by
leucocytosis and elevated ESR.
vii) Acute pulmonary oedema: Some cases develop severe
pulmonary congestion due to left ventricular failure and
develop suffocation, dyspnoea, orthopnoea and bubbling
respiration.
2.
ECG changes. The ECG changes are one of the most
important parameters. Most characteristic ECG change is ST
segment elevation in acute MI (termed as STEMI); other
changes inlcude T wave inversion and appearance of wide
deep Q waves (Fig. 16.20).
3.
Serum cardiac markers. Certain proteins and enzymes
are released into the blood from necrotic heart muscle after
acute MI. Measurement of their levels in serum is helpful in
making a diagnosis and plan management. Rapid assay of
some more specific cardiac proteins is available rendering
the estimation of non-specific estimation of SGOT of historical
importance only in current practice. Important myocardial
markers in use nowadays are as under (Fig. 16.21):
i)
Creatine phosphokinase (CK) and CK-MB: CK has three
forms—
CK-MM derived from skeletal muscle;
CK-BB derived from brain and lungs; and
CK-MB, mainly from cardiac muscles and insignificant
amount from extracardiac tissue.
Thus total CK estimation lacks specificity while elevation
of CK-MB isoenzyme is considerably specific for myocardial
damage. CK-MB has further 2 forms—CK-MB2 is the
myocardial form while CK-MB1 is extracardiac form. A ratio
of CK-MB2: CK-MB1 above 1.5 is highly sensitive for the
diagnosis of acute MI after 4-6 hours of onset of myocardial
ischaemia. CK-MB disappears from blood by 48 hours.
ii) Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). Total LDH estimation also
lacks specificity since this enzyme is present in various tissues
besides myocardium such as in skeletal muscle, kidneys,
liver, lungs and red blood cells. However, like CK, LDH too
has two isoforms of which LDH-1 is myocardial-specific.
Figure 16.20
Some common ECG changes in acute myocardial infarction.

435
CHAPTER 16
The Heart
Estimation of ratio of LDH-1: LDH-2 above 1 is reasonably
helpful in making a diagnosis. LDH levels begin to rise after
24 hours, reach peak in 3 to 6 days and return to normal in
14 days.
iii) Cardiac-specific troponins (cTn): Immunoassay of cTn as a
serum cardiac marker has rendered LDH estimation obsolete.
Troponins are contractile muscle proteins present in human
cardiac and skeletal muscle but cardiac troponins are specific
for myocardium. There are two types of cTn:
cardiac troponin T (cTnT); and
cardiac troponin I (cTnI).
Both cTnT and cTnI are not found in the blood normally,
but after myocardial injury their levels rise very high around
the same time when CK-MB is elevated (i.e. after 4-6 hours).
Both troponin levels remain high for much longer duration;
cTnI for 7-10 days and cTnT for 10-14 days.
iv) Myoglobin: Though myoglobin is the first cardiac marker
to become elevated after myocardial infarction, it lacks
cardiac specificity and is excreted in the urine rapidly. Its
levels, thus, return to normal within 24 hours of attack of
acute MI.
COMPLICATIONS. Following an attack of acute MI, only
10-20% cases do not develop major complications and
recover. The remainder 80-90% cases develop one or more
major complications, some of which are fatal. The immediate
mortality from acute MI (sudden cardiac death) is about 25%.
The important complications which may develop following
acute MI are as follows:
1.
Arrhythmias. Arrhythmias (or abnormalities in the
normal heart rhythm) are the most common complication in
acute MI. These occur due to ischaemic injury or irritation to
the conduction system, resulting in abnormal rhythm. Other
causes of arrhythmias include leakage of K+ from ischaemic
muscle cells and increased concentration of lactate and free
fatty acids in the tissue fluid. Arrhythmias may be in the
form of sinus tachycardia or sinus bradycardia, atrial fibril-
lation, premature systoles, and the most serious ventricular
fibrillation responsible for many sudden cardiac deaths.
2.
Congestive heart failure. About half the patients with
MI develop CHF which may be in the form of right
ventricular failure, left ventricular failure or both. CHF is
responsible for about 40% of deaths from acute MI. If the
patient survives, healing may restore normal cardiac function
but in some CHF may persist and require regular treatment
later.
3.
Cardiogenic shock. About 10% of patients with acute MI
develop cardiogenic shock characterised by hypotension with
systolic blood pressure of 80 mmHg or less for many days.
Shock may be accompanied by peripheral circulatory failure,
oliguria and mental confusion.
4.
Mural thrombosis and thromboembolism. The incidence
of thromboembolism from intracardiac thrombi and from
thrombosis in the leg veins is 15-45% in cases of acute MI
and is the major cause of death in 12% cases. Mural
thrombosis in the heart develops due to involvement of the
endocardium and subendocardium in the infarct and due to
slowing of the heart rate. Mural thrombi often form thrombo-
emboli. Another source of thromboemboli is the venous
thrombosis in the leg veins due to prolonged bed rest.
Thromboemboli from either source may cause occlusion of
the pulmonary, renal, mesenteric, splenic, pancreatic or
cerebral arteries and cause infarcts in these organs.
5.
Rupture. Rupture of the heart occurs in up to 5% cases of
acute MI causing death. Rupture occurs most often from the
infarcted ventricular wall into the pericardial cavity causing
haemopericardium and tamponade. Other sites of rupture
are through interventricular septum and rupture of a
papillary muscle in infarct of the left ventricle. Rupture at
any of these sites occurs usually in the first week and is often
fatal.
6.
Cardiac aneurysm. Another 5% of patients of acute MI
develop aneurysm, often of the left ventricle. It occurs in
healed infarcts through thin, fibrous, non-elastic scar tissue.
Cardiac aneurysms impair the function of the heart and are
the common sites for mural thrombi. Rarely, calcification of
the wall of aneurysm may occur.

7.
Pericarditis. Sterile pericarditis appearing on about the
second day is common over transmural infarcts. It is
characterised by fibrinous pericarditis and may be associated
with pericardial effusion. Often, it is of no functional
significance and resolves spontaneously.
8.
Postmyocardial infarction syndrome. About 3 to 4% of
patients who suffered from acute MI develop postmyocardial
infarction syndrome or Dressler’s syndrome subsequently. It
usually occurs 1 to 6 weeks after the attack of MI. It is
characterised by pneumonitis. The symptoms are usually
mild and disappear in a few weeks. The exact pathogenesis
of this syndrome is not known. It may be due to autoimmune
reaction as evidenced by circulating anti-heart antibodies in
the serum of these patients. But these antibodies are also pre-
sent in patients with acute MI who do not develop this
syndrome.
CHRONIC ISCHAEMIC HEART DISEASE
Chronic ischaemic heart disease, ischaemic cardiomyopathy
or myocardial fibrosis, are the terms used for focal or diffuse
fibrosis in the myocardium characteristically found in elderly
patients of progressive IHD. Such small areas of fibrous
scarring are commonly found in the heart of patients who
have history of episodes of angina and attacks of MI some
years back. The patients generally have gradually developing
CHF due to decompensation over a period of years. Occasio-
nally, serious cardiac arrhythmias or infarction may
supervene and cause death.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. In majority of cases, coronary
atherosclerosis causes progressive ischaemic myocardial
damage and replacement by myocardial fibrosis. A small
percentage of cases may result from other causes such as
emboli, coronary arteritis and myocarditis.
The mechanism of development of myocardial fibrosis
can be explained by one of the following concepts:
i)
Myocardial fibrosis represents healing of minute infarcts
involving small scattered groups of myocardial fibres.
ii) An alternate concept of development of myocardial
fibrosis is healing of minute areas of focal myocytolysis—
the myocardial fibres in a small area undergo slow
degeneration due to myocardial ischaemia. These fibres lose
their myofibrils but nuclei remain intact. These foci are
infiltrated by macrophages and eventually are replaced by
proliferating fibroblasts and collagen.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the heart may be
normal in size or hypertrophied. The left ventricular wall
generally shows foci of grey-white fibrosis in brown
myocardium. Healed scars of previous MI may be present.
Valves of the left heart may be distorted, thickened and
show calcification. Coronary arteries invariably show
moderate to severe atherosclerosis.
Microscopically, the characteristic features are as follows
(Fig. 16.22):
i)
There are scattered areas of diffuse myocardial fibrosis,
especially around the small blood vessels in the interstitial
tissue of the myocardium.
ii) Intervening single fibres and groups of myocardial
fibres show variation in fibre size and foci of myocytolysis.
iii) Areas of brown atrophy of the myocardium may also
be present.
iv) Coronary arteries show atherosclerotic plaques and
may have complicated lesions in the form of super-
imposed thrombosis.
SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH
Sudden cardiac death is defined as sudden death within 24
hours of the onset of cardiac symptoms. The most important
cause is coronary atherosclerosis;  less commonly it may be
due to coronary vasospasm and other non-ischaemic causes.
These include: calcific aortic stenosis, myocarditis of various
types, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitral valve prolapse,
endocarditis, and hereditary and acquired defects of the
conduction system. The mechanism of sudden death by
Figure 16.22
Chronic ischaemic heart disease. There is patchy myocardial fibrosis, especially around small blood vessels in the interstitium.
The intervening single cells and groups of myocardial cells show myocytolysis.

437
CHAPTER 16
The Heart
myocardial ischaemia is almost always by fatal arrhythmias,
chiefly ventricular asystole or fibrillation.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. At autopsy, such cases
reveal most commonly critical atherosclerotic coronary
narrowing (more than 75% compromised lumen) in one
or more of the three major coronary arterial trunks with
superimposed thrombosis or plaque-haemorrhage.
Healed and new myocardial infarcts are found in many
cases.
Table 16.5 lists the important forms of coronary artery
pathology in various types of IHD.
HYPERTENSIVE HEART DISEASE
Hypertensive heart disease or hypertensive cardiomyopathy
is the disease of the heart resulting from systemic
hypertension of prolonged duration and manifesting by left
ventricular hypertrophy. Even mild hypertension (blood
pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg) of sufficient duration
may induce hypertensive heart disease. It is the second most
common form of heart disease after IHD. As already pointed
out, hypertension predisposes to atherosclerosis. Therefore,
most patients of hypertensive heart disease have advanced
coronary atherosclerosis and may develop progressive IHD.
Amongst the causes of death in hypertensive patients,
cardiac decompensation leading to CHF accounts for about
one-third of the patients; other causes of death are IHD,
cerebrovascular stroke, renal failure following arteriolar
nephrosclerosis, dissecting aneurysm of the aorta and sudden
cardiac death.
PATHOGENESIS. The pathogenesis of systemic hyper-
tension is discussed later (Chapter 22). Pathogenesis of left
ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) which is most commonly
caused by systemic hypertension is described here.
Stimulus to LVH is pressure overload in systemic
hypertension. Both genetic and haemodynamic factors
contribute to LVH. The stress of pressure on the ventricular
wall causes increased production of myofilaments,
myofibrils, other cell organelles and nuclear enlargement.
Since the adult myocardial fibres do not divide, the fibres
are hypertrophied. However, the sarcomeres may divide to
increase the cell width.
LVH can be diagnosed by ECG. Aggressive control of
hypertension can regress the left ventricular mass but which
antihypertensive agents would do this, in addition to their
role in controlling blood pressure, is not clearly known.
Abnormalities of diastolic function in hypertension are more
common in hypertension and is present in about one-third
of patients with normal systolic function.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the most signifi-
cant finding is marked hypertrophy of the heart, chiefly
of the left ventricle (see Fig. 16.5). The weight of the heart
increases to 500 gm or more (normal weight about 300
gm). The thickness of the left ventricular wall increases
from its normal 13 to 15 mm up to 20 mm or more. The
papillary muscles and trabeculae carneae are rounded and
prominent. Initially, there is concentric hypertrophy of the
left ventricle (without dilatation). But when decompen-
sation and cardiac failure supervene, there is eccentric
hypertrophy (with dilatation) with thinning of the ventri-
cular wall and there may be dilatation and hypertrophy
of right heart as well.
Microscopically, the features are not as prominent as
macroscopic appearance. The changes include
enlargement and degeneration of myocardial fibres with
focal areas of myocardial fibrosis. In advanced cases, there
may be myocardial oedema and foci of necrosis in the
myocardium.
COR  PULMONALE
Cor pulmonale (cor = heart; pulmonale = lung) or pulmonary
heart disease is the disease of right side of the heart resulting

Systemic Pathology
from disorders of the lungs. It is characterised by right
ventricular dilatation or hypertrophy, or both. Thus, cor
pulmonale is the right-sided counterpart of the hypertensive
heart disease described above.
Depending upon the rapidity of development, cor
pulmonale may be acute or chronic:
Acute cor pulmonale occurs following massive pulmonary
embolism resulting in sudden dilatation of the pulmonary
trunk, conus and right ventricle.
Chronic cor pulmonale is more common and is often
preceded by chronic pulmonary hypertension (Chapter 17).
Following chronic lung diseases can cause chronic
pulmonary hypertension and subsequent cor pulmonale:
i) Chronic emphysema
ii) Chronic bronchitis
iii) Pulmonary tuberculosis
iv) Pneumoconiosis
v) Cystic fibrosis
vi) Hyperventilation in marked obesity (Pickwickian
syndrome)
vii) Multiple organised pulmonary emboli.
PATHOGENESIS. Chronic lung diseases as well as diseases
of the pulmonary vessels cause increased pulmonary
vascular resistance. The most common underlying
mechanism causing increased pulmonary blood pressure
(pulmonary hypertension) is by pulmonary vasoconstriction,
activation of coagulation pathway and obliteration of
pulmonary arterial vessels. Pulmonary hypertension causes
pressure overload on the right ventricle and hence right
ventricular enlargement. Initially, there is right ventricular
hypertrophy, but as cardiac decompensation sets in and right
heart failure ensues, dilatation of right ventricle occurs.
The sequence of events involved in the pathogenesis of
cor pulmonale is summarised in Fig. 16.23.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. In acute cor pulmonale,
there is characteristic ovoid dilatation of the right ventricle,
and sometimes of the right atrium. In chronic cor pulmonale,
there is increase in thickness of the right ventricular wall
from its normal 3 to 5 mm up to 10 mm or more. Often,
there is dilatation of the right ventricle too.
RHEUMATIC FEVER AND
RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE
DEFINITION
Rheumatic fever (RF) is a systemic, post-streptococcal, non-
suppurative inflammatory disease, principally affecting the
heart, joints, central nervous system, skin and subcutaneous
tissues. The chronic stage of RF involves all the layers of the
heart (pancarditis) causing major cardiac sequelae referred
to as rheumatic heart disease (RHD). In spite of its name
suggesting an acute arthritis migrating from joint to joint, it
is well known that it is the heart rather than the joints which
is first and major organ affected. William Boyd years ago
gave the dictum ‘rheumatism licks the joint, but bites the whole
heart’.
INCIDENCE
The disease appears most commonly in children between
the age of 5 to 15 years when the streptococcal infection is
most frequent and intense. Both the sexes are affected equally,
though some investigators have noted a slight female
preponderance.
The geographic distribution, incidence and severity of
RF and RHD are generally related to the frequency and
severity of streptococcal pharyngeal infection. The disease
is seen more commonly in poor socioeconomic strata of the
society living in damp and overcrowded places which
promote interpersonal spread of the streptococcal infection.
Its incidence has declined in the developed countries as a
result of improved living conditions and early use of
antibiotics in streptococcal infection. But it is still common
in the developing countries of the world like in India,
Pakistan, some Arab countries, parts of Africa and South
America. In India, RHD and RF continue to a major public
health problem. In a multicentric survey in school-going
children by the Indian Council of Medical Research, an
incidence of 1 to 5.5 per 1000 children has been reported.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS
After a long controversy, the etiologic role of preceding throat
infection with β-haemolytic streptococci of group A in RF is
now well accepted. However, the mechanism of lesions in
the heart, joints and other tissues is not by direct infection
but by induction of hypersensitivity or autoimmunity. Thus,
there are 2 types of evidences in the etiology and
pathogenesis of RF and RHD: the epidemiologic evidence and
the immunologic evidence.
A. EPIDEMIOLOGIC EVIDENCE. There is a body of
clinical and epidemiological evidence to support the concept
that RF occurs following infection of the throat and upper
respiratory tract with β-haemolytic streptococci of Lancefield
group A. These evidences are as under:
1.
There is often a history of infection of the pharynx and
upper respiratory tract with this microorganism about 2 to 3
weeks prior to the attack of RF. This period is usually the
latent period required for sensitisation to the bacteria.
Figure 16.23
Pathogenesis of cor pulmonale (RVH= right ventricular
hypertrophy, RHF= right heart failure).

439
CHAPTER 16
The Heart
2.
Subsequent attacks of streptococcal infection are generally
associated with exacerbations of RF.
3.
A higher incidence of RF has been observed after
outbreaks and epidemics of streptococcal infection of throat
in children from schools or in young men from training
camps.
4.
Administration of antibiotics leads to lowering of the
incidence as well as severity of RF and its recurrences.
5.
Cardiac lesions similar to those seen in RHD have been
produced in experimental animals by induction of repeated
infection with β-haemolytic streptococci of group A.
6.
Patients with RF have elevated titres of antibodies to the
antigens of β-haemolytic streptococci of group A such as anti-
streptolysin O (ASO) and S, anti-streptokinase, anti-
streptohyaluronidase and anti-DNAase B.
7.
Socioeconomic factors like poverty, poor nutrition, density
of population, overcrowding in quarters for sleeping etc are
associated with spread of infection, lack of proper medical
attention, and hence higher incidence of RF.
8.
The geographic distribution of the disease, as already
pointed out, shows higher frequency and severity of the
disease in the developing countries of the world where the
living conditions are substandard and medical facilities are
insufficient. Populations in these regions develop recurrent
throat infections which remain untreated and have higher
incidence of RF.
9.
The role of climate in the development of RF has been
reported by some workers. The incidence of the disease is
higher in subtropical and tropical regions with cold, damp
climate near the rivers and waterways which favour the
spread of infection.
10. There is evidence to support the role of heredity.
Susceptibility to develop RF in families, occurrence in
identical twins and in individuals with HLA class II alleles
supports the inherited characteristic of the disease.
Despite all these evidences, only a small proportion of
patients with streptococcal pharyngeal infection develop
RF—the attack rate is less than 3%. There is a suggestion
that a concomitant virus enhances the effect of streptococci in
individuals who develop RF.
B. IMMUNOLOGIC EVIDENCE. It has been observed that
though throat of patients during acute RF contain
streptococci, the clinical symptoms of RF appear after a delay
of 2-3 weeks and the organisms cannot be grown from the
lesions in the target tissues. This has led to the concept that
lesions have immune pathogenesis.
A susceptible host, on being encountered with group A
streptococcus infection, mounts an autoimmune reaction by
formation of autoantibodies against bacteria. These
autoantibodies cause damage to human tissues due to cross-
reactivity between epitopes in the components of bacteria
and the host. Streptococcal epitopes present on the bacterial
cell wall, cell membrane and the streptococcal M protein,
are immunologically identical to human molecules on
myosin, keratin, actin, laminin, vimentin and N-acetylgluco-
samine. This molecular mimicry and crossreactivity between
streptococcal M protein in particular and the human
molecules forms the basis of autoimmune damage to human
target tissues in RHD i.e. cardiac muscle, valves, joints, skin,
neurons etc. Further evidences in support are as under:
1. Cell wall polysaccharide of group A streptococcus forms
antibodies which are reactive against cardiac valves. This is
supported by observation of persistently elevated
corresponding autoantibodies in patients who have cardiac
valvular involvement than those without cardiac valve
involvement.
2. Hyaluronate capsule of group A streptococcus is identical
to human hyaluronate present in joint tissues and thus these
tissues are the target of attack.
3. Membrane antigens of group A streptococcus react with
sarcolemma of smooth and cardiac muscle, dermal fibroblasts
and neurons of caudate nucleus.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES
RF is generally regarded as an autoimmune focal
inflammatory disorder of the connective tissues
throughout the body. The cardiac lesions of RF in the form
of pancarditis, particularly the valvular lesions, are its
major manifestations. However, supportive connective
tissues at other sites like the synovial membrane,
periarticular tissue, skin and subcutaneous tissue, arterial
wall, lungs, pleura and the CNS are all affected
(extracardiac lesions).
A. Cardiac Lesions
The cardiac manifestations of RF are in the form of focal
inflammatory involvement of the interstitial tissue of all
the three layers of the heart, the so-called pancarditis. The
pathognomonic feature of pancarditis in RF is the presence
of distinctive Aschoff nodules or Aschoff bodies.
THE ASCHOFF NODULES OR BODIES. The Aschoff
nodules or the Aschoff bodies are spheroidal or fusiform
distinct tiny structures, 1-2 mm in size, occurring in the
interstitium of the heart in RF and may be visible to naked
eye. They are especially found in the vicinity of small
blood vessels in the myocardium and endocardium and
occasionally in the pericardium and the adventitia of the
proximal part of the aorta. Lesions similar to the Aschoff
nodules may be found in the extracardiac tissues.
Evolution of fully-developed Aschoff bodies involves 3
stages all of which may be found in the same heart at
different stages of development. These are as follows:
1.  Early (exudative or degenerative) stage. The earliest
sign of injury in the heart in RF is apparent by about 4th
week of illness. Initially, there is oedema of the connective
tissue and increase in acid mucopolysaccharide in the
ground substance. This results in separation of the
collagen fibres by accumulating ground substance.
Eventually, the collagen fibres are fragmented and
disintegrated and the affected focus takes the appearance
and staining characteristics of fibrin. This change is
referred to as fibrinoid degeneration.
2. Intermediate (proliferative or granulomatous) stage.
It is this stage of the Aschoff body which is pathognomonic
of rheumatic conditions (Fig. 16.24). This stage is apparent

440
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
in 4th to 13th week of illness. The early stage of fibrinoid
change is followed by proliferation of cells that includes
infiltration by lymphocytes (mostly T cells), plasma cells,
a few neutrophils and the characteristic cardiac histiocytes
(Anitschkow cells) at the margin of the lesion. Cardiac
histiocytes or Anitschkow cells are present in small
numbers in normal heart but their number is increased in
the Aschoff bodies; therefore they are not characteristic
of RHD. These are large mononuclear cells having central
round nuclei and contain moderate amount of
amphophilic cytoplasm. The nuclei are vesicular and
contain prominent central chromatin mass which in
longitudinal section appears serrated or caterpillar-like,
while in cross-section the chromatin mass appears as a
small rounded body in the centre of the vesicular nucleus,
just like an owl’s eye. Some of these modified cardiac
histiocytes become multinucleate cells containing 1 to 4
nuclei and are called Aschoff cells and are pathognomonic
of RHD.
3. Late (healing or fibrous) stage. The stage of healing by
fibrosis of the Aschoff nodule occurs in about 12 to 16 weeks
after the illness. The nodule becomes oval or fusiform in
shape, about 200 μm wide and 600 μm long. The
Anitschkow cells in the nodule become spindle-shaped
with diminished cytoplasm and the nuclei stain solidly
rather than showing vesicular character. These cells tend
to be arranged in a palisaded manner. With passage of
months and years, the Aschoff body becomes less cellular
and the collagenous tissue is increased. Eventually, it is
replaced by a small fibrocollagenous scar with little
cellularity, frequently in perivascular location.
RHEUMATIC PANCARDITIS. Although all the three
layers of the heart are affected in RF, the intensity of their
involvement is variable.
1.
RHEUMATIC ENDOCARDITIS. Endocardial lesions
of RF may involve the valvular and mural endocardium,
causing rheumatic valvulitis and mural endocarditis,
respectively. Rheumatic valvulitis is chiefly responsible
for the major cardiac manifestations in chronic RHD.
RHEUMATIC VALVULITIS. Grossly, the valves in acute
RF show thickening and loss of translucency of the valve
leaflets or cusps. This is followed by the formation of
characteristic, small (1 to 3 mm in diameter), multiple,
warty vegetations or verrucae, chiefly along the line of
closure of the leaflets and cusps. These tiny vegetations
are almost continuous so that the free margin of the cusps
or leaflets appears as a rough and irregular ridge. The
vegetations in RF appear grey-brown, translucent and are
firmly attached so that they are not likely to get detached
to form emboli, unlike the friable vegetations of infective
endocarditis (page 445).
Though all the four heart valves are affected, their
frequency and severity of involvement varies: mitral valve
alone being the most common site, followed in decreasing
order of frequency, by combined mitral and aortic valve
(Fig. 16.25). The tricuspid and pulmonary valves usually
show infrequent and slight involvement. The higher
incidence of vegetations on left side of the heart is possibly
because of the greater mechanical stresses on the valves
of the left heart, especially along the line of closure of the
valve cusps (Fig. 16.26, A). The occurrence of vegetations
on the atrial surfaces of the atrioventricular valves (mitral
and tricuspid) and on the ventricular surface of the
semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary) further lends

CHAPTER 16
The Heart
support to the role of mechanical pressure on the valves
in the pathogenesis of vegetations.
The chronic stage of RHD is characterised by
permanent deformity of one or more valves, especially
the mitral (in 98% cases alone or along with other valves)
and aortic. The approximate frequency of deformity of
various valves is as under:
Mitral alone = 37% cases.
Mitral + aortic = 27% cases.
Mitral + aortic + tricuspid = 22% cases.
Mitral + tricuspid = 11% cases.
Aortic alone = 2%.
Mitral + aortic + tricuspid + pulmonary = less than
1% cases.
Thus, mitral valve is almost always involved in RHD.
Gross appearance of chronic healed mitral valve in RHD
is characteristically ‘fish mouth’ or ‘button hole’ stenosis.
Mitral stenosis and insufficiency are commonly combined
in chronic RHD; calcific aortic stenosis may also be found.
These healed chronic valvular lesions in RHD occur due
to diffuse fibrocollagenous thickening and calcification of
the valve cusps or leaflets which cause adhesions between
the lateral portions, especially in the region of the
commissures. Thickening, shortening and fusion of the
chordae tendineae further contribute to the chronic
valvular lesions (Fig. 16.26, B).
Microscopically, the inflammatory changes begin in the
region of the valve rings (where the leaflets are attached
to the fibrous annulus) and then extend throughout the
entire leaflet, whereas vegetations are usually located on
the free margin of the leaflets and cusps.
i)
In the early (acute) stage, the histological changes are
oedema of the valve leaflet, presence of increased number
of capillaries and infiltration with lymphocytes, plasma
cells, histiocytes with many Anitschkow cells and a few
polymorphs. Occasionally, Aschoff bodies with central
foci of fibrinoid necrosis and surrounded by palisade of
cardiac histiocytes are seen, but more often the cellular
infiltration is diffuse in acute stage of RF. Vegetations
present at the free margins of cusps appear as eosinophilic,
tiny structures mainly consisting of fibrin with
superimposed platelet-thrombi and do not contain
bacteria (Fig. 16.27, A).
ii) In the healed (chronic) stage, the vegetations have
undergone organisation. The valves show diffuse
thickening as a result of fibrous tissue with hyalinisation,
and often calcification. Vascularisation of the valve cusps
may still be evident in the form of thick-walled blood
vessels with narrowed lumina (Fig. 16.27, B). Typical
Aschoff bodies are rarely seen in the valves at this stage.
RHEUMATIC MURAL ENDOCARDITIS. Mural endo-
cardium may also show features of rheumatic carditis
though the changes are less conspicuous as compared to
valvular changes.
Grossly, the lesions are seen most commonly as
MacCallum’s patch which is the region of endocardial
surface in the posterior wall of the left atrium just above
the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. MacCallum’s patch
appears as a map-like area of thickened, roughened and
wrinkled part of the endocardium (see Fig. 16.25).
Microscopically, the appearance of MacCallum’s patch
is similar to that seen in rheumatic valvulitis. The affected
area shows oedema, fibrinoid change in the collagen, and
cellular infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells and
macrophages with many Anitschkow cells. Typical
Aschoff bodies may sometimes be found.
2.
RHEUMATIC MYOCARDITIS. Grossly, in the early
(acute) stage, the myocardium, especially of the left
ventricle, is soft and flabby. In the intermediate stage, the

442
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
interstitial tissue of the myocardium shows small foci of
necrosis. Later, tiny pale foci of the Aschoff bodies may
be visible throughout the myocardium.
Microscopically, the most characteristic feature of
rheumatic myocarditis is the presence of distinctive
Aschoff bodies. These diagnostic nodules are scattered
throughout the interstitial tissue of the myocardium and
are most frequent in the interventricular septum, left
ventricle and left atrium. Derangements of the conduction
system may, thus, be present. The Aschoff bodies are best
identified in the intermediate stage when they appear as
granulomas with central fibrinoid necrosis and are
surrounded by palisade of Anitschkow cells and
multinucleate Aschoff cells. There is infiltration by
lymphocytes, plasma cells and some neutrophils. In the
late stage, the Aschoff bodies are gradually replaced by
small fibrous scars in the vicinity of blood vessels and the
inflammatory infiltrate subsides. Presence of active
Aschoff bodies along with old healed lesions is indicative
of rheumatic activity.
3.
RHEUMATIC PERICARDITIS. Inflammatory
involvement of the pericardium commonly accompanies
RHD.
Grossly, the usual finding is fibrinous pericarditis in
which there is loss of normal shiny pericardial surface due
to deposition of fibrin on its surface and accumulation of
slight amount of fibrinous exudate in the pericardial sac.
If the parietal pericardium is pulled off from the visceral
pericardium, the two separated surfaces are shaggy due
to thick fibrin covering them. This appearance is often
likened to ‘bread and butter appearance’ i.e. resembling the
buttered surfaces of two slices in a sandwich when they
are gently pulled apart. If fibrinous pericarditis fails to
resolve and, instead, undergoes organisation, the two
layers of the pericardium form fibrous adhesions resulting
in chronic adhesive pericarditis.
Microscopically, fibrin is identified on the surfaces. The
subserosal connective tissue is infiltrated by lymphocytes,
plasma cells, histiocytes and a few neutrophils.
Characteristic Aschoff bodies may be seen which later
undergo organisation and fibrosis. Organisation of the
exudate causes fibrous adhesions between the visceral and
parietal surfaces of the pericardial sac and obliterates the
pericardial cavity.
B. Extracardiac Lesions
Patients of the syndrome of acute rheumatism develop
lesions in connective tissue elsewhere in the body, chiefly
the joints, subcutaneous tissue, arteries, brain and lungs.
1.
POLYARTHRITIS. Acute and painful inflammation of
the synovial membranes of some of the joints, especially the
larger joints of the limbs, is seen in about 90% cases of RF in
adults and less often in children. As pain and swelling
subside in one joint, others tend to get involved, producing
the characteristic ‘migratory polyarthritis’ involving two or
more joints at a time.
Histologically, the changes are transitory. The synovial
membrane and the periarticular connective tissue show
hyperaemia, oedema, fibrinoid change and neutrophilic
infiltration. Sometimes, focal lesions resembling Aschoff
bodies are observed. A serous effusion into the joint cavity
is commonly present.
2.
SUBCUTANEOUS NODULES. The subcutaneous
nodules of RF occur more often in children than in adult.
These nodules are small (0.5 to 2 cm in diameter), spherical
or ovoid and painless. They are attached to deeper structures

CHAPTER 16
The Heart
like tendons, ligaments, fascia or periosteum and therefore
often remain unnoticed by the patient. Characteristic
locations are extensor surfaces of the wrists, elbows, ankles
and knees.
Histologically, the subcutaneous nodules of RF are
representative of giant Aschoff bodies of the heart. They
consist of 3 distinct zones: a central area with fibrinoid
changes, surrounded by a zone of histiocytes and
fibroblasts forming a palisade arrangement, and the
outermost zone of connective tissue which is infiltrated
by non-specific chronic inflammatory cells and
proliferating blood vessels.
It may be mentioned here that histologically similar but
clinically different subcutaneous lesions appear in
rheumatoid arthritis; they are larger, painful and tender and
persist for months to years (Chapter 28).
3.
ERYTHEMA MARGINATUM. This non-pruritic
erythematous rash is characteristic of RF. The lesions occur
mainly on the trunk and proximal parts of the extremities.
The erythematous area develops central clearing and has
slightly elevated red margins. The erythema is transient and
migratory.
4.
RHEUMATIC ARTERITIS. Arteritis in RF involves not
only the coronary arteries and the aorta but also occurs in
arteries of various other organs such as renal, mesenteric and
cerebral arteries. The lesions in the coronaries are seen mainly
in the small intramyocardial branches.
Histologically, the lesions may be like those of
hypersensitivity angiitis (Chapter 15), or sometimes may
resemble polyarteritis nodosa. Occasionally, foci of
fibrinoid necrosis or ill-formed Aschoff bodies may be
present close to the vessel wall.
5.
CHOREA MINOR. Chorea minor or Sydenham’s chorea
or Saint Vitus’ dance is a delayed manifestation of RF as a
result of involvement of the central nervous system. The
condition is characterised by disordered and involuntary
jerky movements of the trunk and the extremities
accompanied by some degree of emotional instability. The
condition occurs more often in younger age, particularly in
girls.
Histologically, the lesions are located in the cerebral
hemispheres, brainstem and the basal ganglia. They
consist of small haemorrhages, oedema and perivascular
infiltration of lymphocytes. There may be endarteritis
obliterans and thrombosis of cortical and meningeal
vessels.
6.
RHEUMATIC PNEUMONITIS AND PLEURITIS.
Involvement of the lungs and pleura occurs rarely in RF.
Pleuritis is often accompanied with serofibrinous pleural
effusion but definite Aschoff bodies are not present. In
rheumatic pneumonitis, the lungs are large, firm and
rubbery.
Histologically, the changes are oedema, capillary
haemorrhages and focal areas of fibrinous exudate in the
alveoli. Aschoff bodies are generally not found.
CLINICAL FEATURES
The first attack of acute RF generally appears 2 to 3 weeks
after streptococcal pharyngitis, most often in children
between the age of 5 to 15 years. With subsequent
streptococcal pharyngitis, there is reactivation of the disease
and similar clinical manifestations appear with each recurrent
attack. The disease generally presents with migratory
polyarthritis and fever. However, RF has widespread
systemic involvement and no single specific laboratory
diagnostic test is available. As per revised WHO criteria
(2004) based on revised Jones’ criteria (first described by Dr.
TD Jones in 1944, and last revised in 1992), following major
and minor criteria are included for diagnosis:
A. Major criteria:
1.
Carditis
2.
Polyarthritis
3.
Chorea (Sydenham’s chorea)
4.
Erythema marginatum
5.
Subcutaneous nodules
B. Minor criteria:
1.
Fever
2.
Arthralgia
3.
Previous history of RF
4.
Laboratory findings  of elevated ESR, raised C-reactive
protein, and leucocytosis
5.
ECG finding of prolonged PR interval.
C. Supportive evidence of preceding group A streptococcal
infection include: positive throat culture for group A
streptococci, raised titres of streptococcal antibodies
(antistreptolysin O and S, antistreptokinase, anti-strepto-
hyaluronidase and anti DNAase B).
Clinical diagnosis of RF and RHD is made in a case with
antecedent laboratory evidence of streptococcal throat
infection in the presence of any two of the major criteria, or
occurrence of one major and two minor criteria.
If the heart is spared in a case of acute RF, the patient
may have complete recovery without any sequelae. However,
once the heart is involved, it is often associated with
reactivation and recurrences of the disease. Myocarditis, in
particular, is the most life-threatening due to involvement
of the conduction system of the heart and results in serious
arrhythmias. The long-term sequelae or stigmata are the
chronic valvular deformities, especially the mitral stenosis,
as already explained on page 441. Initially, a state of
compensation occurs, while later decompensation of the heart
leads to full-blown cardiac failure. Currently, surgical
replacement of the damaged valves can alter the clinical
course of the disease.
The major causes of death in RHD are cardiac failure,
bacterial endocarditis and embolism:
1.
Cardiac failure is the most common cause of death from
RHD. In young patients, cardiac failure occurs due to the

444
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
chronic valvular deformities, while in older patients coronary
artery disease may be superimposed on old RHD.
2.
Bacterial endocarditis of both acute and subacute type may
supervene due to inadequate use of antibiotics.
3.
Embolism in RHD originates most commonly from mural
thrombi in the left atrium and its appendages, in association
with mitral stenosis. The organs most frequently affected are
the brain, kidneys, spleen and lungs.
4.
Sudden death may occur in RHD as a result of ball
thrombus in the left atrium or due to acute coronary
insufficiency in association with aortic stenosis.
NON-RHEUMATIC ENDOCARDITIS
Inflammatory involvement of the endocardial layer of the
heart is called endocarditis. Though in common usage, if not
specified endocarditis would mean inflammation of the
valvular endocardium, several workers designate
endocarditis on the basis of anatomic area of the involved
endocardium such as: valvular for valvular endocardium,
mural for inner lining of the lumina of cardiac chambers,
chordal for the endocardium of the chordae tendineae,
trabecular for the endocardium of trabeculae carneae, and
papillary for the endocardium covering the papillary muscles.
Endocarditis can be broadly grouped into non-infective and
infective types (Table 16.6). Most types of endocarditis are
characterised by the presence of ‘vegetations’ or ‘verrucae’
which have distinct features.
ATYPICAL VERRUCOUS
(LIBMAN-SACKS) ENDOCARDITIS
Libman and Sacks, two American physicians, described a
form of endocarditis in 1924 that is characterised by sterile
endocardial vegetations which are distinguishable from the
vegetations of RHD and bacterial endocarditis.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Atypical verrucous endocarditis is
one of the manifestations of  ‘collagen diseases’. Charac-
teristic lesions of Libman-Sacks endocarditis are seen in 50%
cases of acute systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); other
diseases associated with this form of endocarditis are
systemic sclerosis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
(TTP) and other collagen diseases.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, characteristic
vegetations occur most frequently on the mitral and
tricuspid valves. The vegetations of atypical verrucous
endocarditis are small (1 to 4 mm in diameter), granular,
multiple and tend to occur on both surfaces of affected
valves, in the valve pockets and on the adjoining
ventricular and atrial endocardium. The vegetations are
sterile unless superimposed by bacterial endocarditis.
Unlike vegetations of RHD, the healed vegetations of
Libman-Sacks endocarditis do not produce any significant
valvular deformity. Frequently, fibrinous or serofibrinous
pericarditis with pericardial effusion is associated.
Microscopically, the verrucae of Libman-Sacks
endocarditis are composed of fibrinoid material with
superimposed fibrin and platelet thrombi. The endo-
cardium underlying the verrucae shows characteristic
histological changes which include fibrinoid necrosis,
proliferation of capillaries and infiltration by histiocytes,
plasma cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils and the
pathognomonic haematoxylin bodies of Gross which are
counterparts of LE cells of the blood. Similar inflammatory
changes may be found in the interstitial connective tissue
of the myocardium. The Aschoff bodies are never found
in the endocardium or myocardium.
NON-BACTERIAL THROMBOTIC
(CACHECTIC, MARANTIC) ENDOCARDITIS
Non-bacterial thrombotic, cachectic, marantic or terminal
endocarditis or endocarditis simplex is an involvement of
the heart valves by sterile thrombotic vegetations.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The exact pathogenesis of lesions
in non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is not clear.
Vegetations are found at autopsy in 0.5 to 5% of cases. The
following diseases and conditions are frequently associated
with their presence:
1.
In patients having hypercoagulable state from various
etiologies e.g. advanced cancer (in 50% case of NBTE)
especially mucinous adenocarcinomas, chronic tuberculosis,
renal failure and chronic sepsis. In view of its association
with chronic debilitating and wasting diseases, alternate
names for NBTE such as ‘cachectic’, ‘marantic’ and ‘terminal’
endocarditis are used synonymously.
2.
Occurrence of these lesions in young and well-nourished
patients is explained on the basis of alternative hypothesis such
as allergy, vitamin C deficiency, deep vein thrombosis, and
endocardial trauma (e.g. due to catheter in pulmonary artery
and haemodynamic trauma to the valves).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the verrucae of
NBTE are located on cardiac valves, chiefly mitral, and
less often aortic and tricuspid valve. These verrucae are
usually small (1 to 5 mm in diameter), single or multiple,
brownish and occur along the line of closure of the leaflets
but are more friable than the vegetations of RHD.
Organised and healed vegetations appear as fibrous
nodules. Normal age-related appearance of tag-like
appendage at the margin of the valve cusps known as
‘Lambl’s excrescences’ is an example of such healed
lesions.

CHAPTER 16
The Heart
Microscopically, the vegetations in NBTE are composed
of fibrin along with entangled RBCs, WBCs and platelets.
Vegetations in NBTE are sterile, bland and do not cause
tissue destruction. The underlying valve shows swollen
collagen, fibrinoid change and capillary proliferation but
does not show any inflammatory infiltrate.
Embolic phenomenon is seen in many cases of NBTE and
results in infarcts in the brain, lungs, spleen and kidneys.
The bland vegetations of NBTE on infection may produce
bacterial endocarditis.
INFECTIVE (BACTERIAL) ENDOCARDITIS
DEFINITION. Infective or bacterial endocarditis (IE or BE)
is serious infection of the valvular and mural endocardium
caused by different forms of microorganisms and is
characterised by typical infected and friable vegetations. A
few specific forms of IE are named by the microbial etiologic
agent causing them e.g. tubercle bacilli, fungi etc. Depending
upon the severity of infection, BE is subdivided into 2 clinical
forms:
1.
Acute bacterial endocarditis (ABE) is fulminant and
destructive acute infection of the endocardium by highly
virulent bacteria in a previously normal heart and almost
invariably runs a rapidly fatal course in a period of 2-6 weeks.
2.
Subacute bacterial endocarditis (SABE) or endocarditis
lenta (lenta = slow) is caused by less virulent bacteria in a
previously diseased heart and has a gradual downhill course
in a period of 6 weeks to a few months and sometimes years.
Although classification of bacterial endocarditis into acute
and subacute forms has been largely discarded because the
clinical course is altered by antibiotic treatment, still a few
important distinguishing features are worth describing
(Table 16.7). However, features of the vegetations in the two
forms of BE are difficult to distinguish.
INCIDENCE. Introduction of antibiotic drugs has helped
greatly in lowering the incidence of BE as compared with its
incidence in the pre-antibiotic era. Though BE may occur at
any age, most cases of ABE as well as SABE occur over 50
years of age. Males are affected more often than females.
ETIOLOGY. All cases of BE are caused by infection with
microorganisms in patients having certain predisposing
factors.
A. Infective agents. About 90% cases of BE are caused by
streptococci and staphylococci.
In ABE, the most common causative organisms are viru-
lent strains of staphylococci, chiefly Staphylococcus aureus.
Others are pneumococci, gonococci, β-streptococci and
enterococci.
In SABE, the commonest causative organisms are the
streptococci with low virulence, predominantly Streptococcus
viridans, which forms part of normal flora of the mouth and
pharynx. Other less common etiologic agents include other
strains of streptococci and staphylococci (e.g. Streptococcus
bovis which is the normal inhabitant of gastrointestinal tract,
Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus epidermidis which
is a commensal of the skin), gram-negative enteric bacilli (e.g.
E. coli, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Salmonella), pneumococci,
gonococci and Haemophilus influenzae.
B. Predisposing factors. There are 3 main factors which
predispose to the development of both forms of BE:
1.
Conditions initiating transient bacteraemia, septicaemia
and pyaemia.
2.
Underlying heart disease.
3.
Impaired host defenses.
1.
Bacteraemia, septicaemia and pyaemia: Bacteria gain entrance
to the bloodstream causing transient and clinically silent
bacteraemia in a variety of day-to-day procedures as well as
from other sources of infection. Some of the common
examples are:
i)
Periodontal infections such as trauma from vigorous
brushing of teeth, hard chewing, tooth extraction and other
dental procedures.
ii) Infections of the genitourinary tract such as in catheteri-
sation, cystoscopy, obstetrical procedures including normal
delivery and abortions.
iii) Infections of gastrointestinal and biliary tract.
iv) Surgery of the bowel, biliary tract and genitourinary
tracts.
v) Skin infections such as boils, carbuncles and abscesses.
vi) Upper and lower respiratory tract infections including
bacterial pneumonias.
vii) Intravenous drug abuse.
viii) Cardiac catheterisation and cardiac surgery for
implantation of prosthetic valves.
2.
Underlying heart disease: SABE occurs much more
frequently in previously diseased heart valves, whereas the
ABE is common in previously normal heart. Amongst the
commonly associated underlying heart diseases are the
following:
i)
Chronic rheumatic valvular disease in about 50% cases.
ii) Congenital heart diseases in about 20% cases. These
include VSD, subaortic stenosis, pulmonary stenosis,
bicuspid aortic valve, coarctation of the aorta, and PDA.
iii) Other causes are syphilitic aortic valve disease,
atherosclerotic valvular disease, floppy mitral valve, and
prosthetic heart valves.

Systemic Pathology
3.
Impaired host defenses: All conditions in which there is
depression of specific immunity, deficiency of complement
and defective phagocytic function, predispose to BE.
Following are some of the examples of such conditions:
i)
Impaired specific immunity in lymphomas.
ii) Leukaemias.
iii) Cytotoxic therapy for various forms of cancers and trans-
plant patients.
iv) Deficient functions of neutrophils and macrophages.
PATHOGENESIS. Bacteria causing BE on entering the
bloodstream from any of the above-mentioned routes are
implanted on the cardiac valves or mural endocardium
because they have surface adhesion molecules which mediate
their adherence to injured endocardium. There are several
predisposing conditions which explain the development of
bacterial implants on the valves:
1.
The circulating bacteria are lodged much more frequently
on previously damaged valves from diseases, chiefly RHD,
congenital heart diseases and prosthetic valves, than on
healthy valves.
2.
Conditions producing haemodynamic stress on the valves
are liable to cause damage to the endothelium, favouring
the formation of platelet-fibrin thrombi which get infected
from circulating bacteria.
3.
Another alternative hypothesis is the occurrence of non-
bacterial thrombotic endocarditis from prolonged stress which
is followed by bacterial contamination.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The characteristic patho-
logic feature in both ABE and SABE is the presence of
typical vegetations or verrucae on the valve cusps or
leaflets, and less often, on mural endocardium, which are
quite distinct for other types. A summary of the
distinguishing features of the principal types of vegetations
is presented in Table 16.8.
Grossly, the lesions are found commonly on the valves of
the left heart, most frequently on the mitral, followed in
descending frequency, by the aortic, simultaneous
involvement of both mitral and aortic valves, and quite
rarely on the valves of the right heart. The vegetations in
SABE are more often seen on previously diseased valves,
whereas the vegetations of ABE are often found on
previously normal valves. Like in RHD, the vegetations
are often located on the atrial surface of atrioventricular
valves and ventricular surface of the semilunar valves.
They begin from the contact areas of the valve and may
extend along the surface of the valves and on to the
adjacent endocardium (Fig. 16.28).
The vegetations of BE vary in size from a few
millimeters to several centimeters, grey-tawny to greenish,
irregular, single or multiple, and typically friable. They
may appear flat, filiform, fungating or polypoid. The
vegetations in ABE tend to be bulkier and globular than
those of SABE and are located more often on previously
normal valves, may cause ulceration or perforation of the
underlying valve leaflet, or may produce myocardial
abscesses.
Microscopically, the vegetations of BE consist of 3 zones
(Fig. 16.29):
i)
The outer layer or cap consists of eosinophilic material
composed of fibrin and platelets.
ii) Underneath this layer is the basophilic zone containing
colonies of bacteria. However, bacterial component of the
vegetations may be lacking in treated cases.
iii) The deeper zone consists of non-specific inflamma-
tory reaction in the cusp itself, and in the case of SABE
there may be evidence of repair.
In the acute fulminant form of the disease, the inflam-
matory cell infiltrate chiefly consists of neutrophils and is

accompanied with tissue necrosis and abscesses in the valve
rings and in the myocardium. In the subacute form, there is
healing by granulation tissue, mononuclear inflammatory cell
infiltration and fibroblastic proliferation. Histological
evidence of pre-existing valvular disease such as RHD may
be present in SABE.
COMPLICATIONS AND SEQUELAE. Most cases of BE
present with fever. The acute form of BE is characterised by
high grade fever, chills, weakness and malaise while the
subacute form of the disease has non-specific manifestations
like slight fever, fatigue, loss of weight and flu-like
symptoms. In the early stage, the lesions are confined to the

Systemic Pathology
heart, while subsequent progression of the disease leads to
involvement of extra-cardiac organs.  In general, severe
complications develop early in ABE than in SABE.
Complications and sequelae of BE are divided into cardiac
and extracardiac (Fig. 16.30):
A. Cardiac complications. These include the following:
i)
Valvular stenosis or insufficiency
ii) Perforation, rupture, and aneurysm of valve leaflets
iii) Abscesses in the valve ring
iv) Myocardial abscesses
v) Suppurative pericarditis
vi) Cardiac failure from one or more of the foregoing
complications.
B. Extracardiac complications. Since the vegetations in BE
are typically friable, they tend to get dislodged due to rapid
stream of blood and give rise to embolism which is
responsible for very common and serious extra-cardiac
complications. These are as under:
i)
Emboli originating from the left side of the heart and
entering the systemic circulation affect organs like the spleen,
kidneys, and brain causing infarcts, abscesses and mycotic
aneurysms.
ii) Emboli arising from right side of the heart enter the
pulmonary circulation and produce pulmonary abscesses.
iii) Petechiae may be seen in the skin and conjunctiva due to
either emboli or toxic damage to the capillaries.
iv) In SABE, there are painful, tender nodules on the finger
tips of hands and feet called Osler’s nodes, while in ABE there
is appearance of painless, non-tender subcutaneous
maculopapular lesions on the pulp of the fingers called
Janeway’s spots. In either case, their origin is due to toxic or
allergic inflammation of the vessel wall.
v) Focal necrotising glomerulonephritis is seen more commonly
in SABE than in ABE. Occasionally diffuse glomerulo-
nephritis may occur. Both these have their pathogenesis in
circulating immune complexes (hypersensitivity
phenomenon) (Chapter 22).
Treatment of BE with antibiotics in adequate dosage kills
the bacteria but complications and sequelae of healed
endocardial lesions may occur even after successful therapy.
The causes of death are cardiac failure, persistent infection,
embolism to vital organs, renal failure and rupture of mycotic
aneurysm of cerebral arteries.
SPECIFIC TYPES OF INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS
Besides BE, various other microbes may occasionally produce
infective endocarditis which are named according to the
etiologic agent causing it. These include the following:
1.
Tuberculous endocarditis. Though tubercle bacilli are
bacteria, tuberculous endocarditis is described separate from
the bacterial endocarditis due to specific granulomatous
inflammation found in tuberculosis. It is characterised by
presence of typical tubercles on the valvular as well as mural
endocardium and may form tuberculous thromboemboli.
2.
Syphilitic endocarditis. The endocardial lesions in
syphilis have already been described in relation to syphilitic
aortitis on page 401. The severest manifestation of
cardiovascular syphilis is aortic valvular incompetence.
3.
Fungal endocarditis. Rarely, endocardium may be
infected with fungi such as from Candida albicans, Histoplasma

Complications and sequelae of infective endocarditis.

The Heart
capsulatum, Aspergillus, Mucor, coccidioidomycosis, crypto-
coccosis, blastomycosis and actinomycosis. Opportunistic
fungal infections like candidiasis and aspergillosis are seen
more commonly in patients receiving long-term antibiotic
therapy, intravenous drug abusers and after prosthetic valve
replacement. Fungal endocarditis produces appearance
similar to that in BE but the vegetations are bulkier in fungal
endocarditis.
4.
Viral endocarditis. There is only experimental evidence
of existence of this entity.
5.
Rickettsial endocarditis. Another rare cause of
endocarditis is from infection with rickettsiae in Q fever.
VALVULAR DISEASES AND DEFORMITIES
Valvular diseases are various forms of congenital and
acquired diseases which cause valvular deformities. Many
of them result in cardiac failure. Rheumatic heart disease is
the most common form of acquired valvular disease. Valves
of the left side of the heart are involved much more frequently
than those of the right side of the heart. The mitral valve is
affected most often, followed in descending frequency, by
the aortic valve, and combined mitral and aortic valves. The
valvular deformities may be of 2 types: stenosis and
insufficiency:
Stenosis is the term used for failure of a valve to open
completely during diastole resulting in obstruction to the
forward flow of the blood.
Insufficiency or incompetence or regurgitation is the failure
of a valve to close completely during systole resulting in back
flow or regurgitation of the blood.
The congenital valvular diseases have already been
described (page 425). Various acquired valvular diseases that
may deform the heart valves are listed below:
1.
RHD, the commonest cause (page 438)
2.
Infective endocarditis (page 445)

Carcinoid heart disease.
The major forms of vegetative endocarditis involving the
valves have already been described. Others along with the
consequences of these valvular diseases in the form of
stenosis and insufficiency of the heart valves are described
below.
MITRAL STENOSIS
Mitral stenosis occurs in approximately 40% of all patients
with RHD. About 70% of the patients are women. The latent
period between the rheumatic carditis and development of
symptomatic mitral stenosis is about two decades.
ETIOLOGY. Mitral stenosis is generally rheumatic in origin.
Less common causes include bacterial endocarditis, Libman-
Sacks endocarditis, endocardial fibroelastosis and congenital
parachute mitral valve.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The appearance of the
mitral valve in stenosis varies according to the extent of
involvement. Generally, the valve leaflets are diffusely
thickened by fibrous tissue and/or calcific deposits,
especially towards the closing margin. There are fibrous
adhesions of mitral commissures and fusion and
shortening of chordae tendineae. In less extensive
involvement, the bases of the leaflets of mitral valve are
mobile while the free margins have puckered and
thickened tissue with narrowed orifice; this is called as
‘purse-string puckering’. The more advanced cases have
rigid, fixed and immobile diaphragm-like valve leaflets
with narrow, slit-like or oval mitral opening, commonly
referred to as ‘button-hole’ or ‘fish-mouth’ mitral orifice
(Fig. 16.31,B).
EFFECTS. In normal adults, the mitral orifice is about 5 cm2.
Symptomatic mitral stenosis develops if the valve opening
is reduced to 1 cm2 resulting in significant elevation of left
atrial pressure from the normal of 12 mmHg to about 25
mmHg leading to dilatation of the left atrium. The elevated
left atrial pressure, in turn, raises pressure in the pulmonary
veins and capillaries, reducing the pulmonary function and
causing exertional dyspnoea which is the chief symptom of
mitral stenosis. The effects of mitral stenosis can thus be
summarised as under:
1.
Dilatation and hypertrophy of the left atrium.

Systemic Pathology
2.
Normal-sized or atrophic left ventricle due to reduced
inflow of blood.
3.
Pulmonary hypertension resulting from passive
backward transmission of elevated left artial pressure which
causes:
i) chronic passive congestion of the lungs;
ii) hypertrophy and dilatation of the right ventricle; and
iii) dilatation of the right atrium when right heart failure
supervenes.
MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY
Mitral insufficiency is caused by RHD in about 50% of
patients but in contrast to mitral stenosis, pure mitral
insufficiency occurs more often in men (75%). Subsequently,
mitral insufficiency is associated with some degree of mitral
stenosis.
ETIOLOGY. All the causes of mitral stenosis may produce
mitral insufficiency, RHD being the most common cause. In
addition, mitral insufficiency may result from non-
inflammatory calcification of mitral valve annulus (in the
elderly), myxomatous transformation of mitral valve (floppy
valve syndrome), rupture of a leaflet or of the chordae
tendineae or of a papillary muscle. A few other conditions
cause mitral insufficiency by dilatation of the mitral ring such
as in myocardial infarction, myocarditis and left ventricular
failure in hypertension.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The appearance of the
mitral valve in insufficiency varies according to the
underlying cause. The rheumatic process produces
rigidity, deformity and retraction of the valve leaflets and
fusion of commissures as well as shortening and fusion
of chordae tendineae (Fig. 16.31,C).
In myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve leaflets
(floppy valve syndrome) which is described on page 451,
there is prolapse of one or both leaflets into the left atrium
during systole.
In non-inflammatory calcification of mitral annulus seen
in the aged, there is irregular, stony-hard, bead-like
thickening in the region of mitral annulus without any
associated inflammatory changes. It is thought to reflect
degenerative changes of aging.
EFFECTS. The regurgitant mitral orifice produces
progressive increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume
as well as pressure since the left ventricle cannot empty
completely. This results in rise in left atrial pressure and
dilatation. As a consequence of left atrial hypertension,
pulmonary hypertension occurs resulting in pulmonary
oedema and right heart failure. In symptomatic cases of
mitral insufficiency, the major symptoms are related to
decreased cardiac output (e.g. fatigue and weakness) and
due to pulmonary congestion (e.g. exertional dyspnoea and
orthopnoea) but the features are less well marked than in
mitral stenosis. The effects of mitral insufficiency may be
summarised as under:
1.
Dilatation and hypertrophy of the left ventricle.
2.
Marked dilatation of the left atrium.
3.
Features of pulmonary hypertension such as:
i) chronic passive congestion of the lungs;
ii) hypertrophy and dilatation of the right ventricle; and
 iii) dilatation of the right atrium when right heart failure
supervenes.
AORTIC STENOSIS
Aortic stenosis comprises about one-fourth of all patients
with chronic valvular heart disease. About 80% patients of
symptomatic aortic stenosis are males. It is of 2 main types:
non-calcific and calcific type, the latter being more common.
1.
Non-calcific aortic stenosis. The most common cause of
non-calcific aortic stenosis is chronic RHD. Other causes are
congenital valvular and subaortic stenosis and congenitally
bicuspid aortic valve.
2.
Calcific aortic stenosis. Calcific aortic stenosis is more
common type. Various causes have been ascribed to it. These
include healing by scarring followed by calcification of aortic
valve such as in RHD, bacterial endocarditis, Brucella
endocarditis, Monckeberg’s calcific aortic stenosis (page 392),
healed congenital malformation and familial hypercholes-
terolaemic xanthomatosis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The aortic cusps show
characteristic fibrous thickening and calcific nodularity
of the closing edges. Calcified nodules are often found in
the sinuses of Valsalva. In rheumatic aortic stenosis, the
commissures are fused and calcified, while in non-
rheumatic aortic stenosis there is no commissural fusion
(Fig. 16.32,B).

CHAPTER 16
The Heart
cases (Chapter 20). The lesions are characteristically located
in the valves and endocardium of the right side of the heart.
The pathogenesis of the cardiac lesions is not certain. But in
carcinoid tumour with hepatic metastasis, there is increased
blood level of serotonin secreted by the tumour. The
increased concentration of serotonin reaches the right side
of the heart and causes the lesions but serotonin is inactivated
on passage of the blood through the lungs and hence the left
heart is relatively spared. In addition, high levels of
bradykinin may play contributory role in carcinoid heart
disease. However, chronic infusion of serotonin or bradykinin
in experimental animals has not succeeded in producing
cardiac lesions; hence the exact pathogenesis of carcinoid
heart disease remains obscure.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. In majority of cases, the
lesions are limited to the right side of the heart. Both
pulmonary and tricuspid valves as well as the endo-
cardium of the right chambers show characteristic
cartilage-like fibrous plaques. Similar plaques may occur
on the intima of the great veins, the coronary sinus and
the great arteries. Occasionally, the lesions may be found
on the left side of the heart.
EFFECTS. The thickening and contraction of the cusps and
leaflets of the valves of the outflow tracts of the right heart
result mainly in pulmonary stenosis and tricuspid
regurgitation, and to a lesser extent, pulmonary regurgitation
and tricuspid stenosis.
MYXOMATOUS DEGENERATION OF MITRAL VALVE
(MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE)
Myxomatous or mucoid degeneration of the valves of the
heart is a peculiar condition occurring in young patients
between the age of 20 and 40 years and is more common in
women. The condition is common and seen in 5% of general
adult population. The condition is also known by other
synonyms like ‘floppy valve syndrome’ or ‘mitral valve
prolapse’.
ETIOLOGY. The cause of the condition is not known but in
some cases it may be genetically determined collagen
disorder. Association with Marfan’s syndrome has been
observed in 90% of patients. Others have noted myxomatous
degeneration in cases of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and in
myotonic dystrophy. However, the myxomatous valvular
changes seen in the aged patients are not related to this entity.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Any cardiac valve may be
involved but mitral valve is affected most frequently. The
disease is usually most severe and most common in the
posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. The affected leaflet
shows either excessive or redundant leaflet tissue, which
is opaque white, soft and floppy. Cut section of the valve
reveals mucoid or myxoid appearance. A significant
feature is the ballooning or aneurysmal protrusion of the
affected leaflet and hence the name ‘mitral valve prolapse’
and ‘floppy valve syndrome’.
EFFECTS. Aortic stenosis becomes symptomatic when the
valve orifice is reduced to 1 cm2 from its normal 3 cm2. The
symptoms appear many years later when the heart cannot
compensate and the stenosis is quite severe. The major effect
of aortic stenosis is obstruction to the outflow resulting in
concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle. Later, when
cardiac failure supervenes, there is dilatation as well as
hypertrophy of the left ventricle (eccentric hypertrophy).
The three cardinal symptoms of aortic stenosis are:
exertional dyspnoea, angina pectoris and syncope. Exertional
dyspnoea results from elevation of pulmonary capillary
pressure. Angina pectoris usually results from elevation of
pulmonary capillary pressure and usually develops due to
increased demand of hypertrophied myocardial mass.
Syncope results from accompanying coronary insufficiency.
Sudden death may also occur in an occasional case of aortic
stenosis.
AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY
About three-fourth of all patients with aortic insufficiency
are males with some having family history of Marfan’s
syndrome.
ETIOLOGY. In about 75% of patients, the cause is chronic
RHD. However, isolated aortic insufficiency is less often due
to rheumatic etiology. Other causes include syphilitic
valvulitis, infective endocarditis, congenital subaortic
stenosis (congenitally bicuspid aortic valve), myxomatous
degeneration of aortic valve (floppy valve syndrome),
traumatic rupture of the valve cusps, dissecting aneurysm,
Marfan’s syndrome and ankylosing spondylitis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The aortic valve cusps are
thickened, deformed and shortened and fail to close. There
is generally distension and distortion of the ring
(Fig. 16.31,C).
EFFECTS. As a result of regurgitant aortic orifice, there is
increase of the left ventricular end-diastolic volume. This
leads to hypertrophy and dilatation of the left ventricle
producing massive cardiac enlargement so that the heart may
weigh as much as 1000 gm. Failure of the left ventricle
increases the pressure in the left atrium and eventually
pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure occurs.
The characteristic physical findings in a patient of aortic
insufficiency are awareness of the beatings of the heart,
poundings in the head with each heartbeat, low diastolic and
high pulse pressure, rapidly rising and collapsing water
hammer pulse (Corrigan’s pulse), booming ‘pistol shot’
sound over the femoral artery, and systolic and diastolic
murmur heard over the femoral artery when it is lightly
compressed (Durozier’s sign). Sometimes, angina pectoris
occurs due to increased myocardial demand or due to
coronary insufficiency.
CARCINOID HEART DISEASE
ETIOLOGY. Carcinoid syndrome developing in patients
with extensive hepatic metastases from a carcinoid tumour
is characterised by cardiac manifestations in about half the

452
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Microscopically, the enlarged cusp shows loose
connective tissue with abundant mucoid or myxoid
material due to abundance of mucopolysaccharide.
EFFECTS. Usually the condition does not produce any
symptoms or significant valvular dysfunction. The condition
is recognised during life by the characteristic mid-systolic
click followed by a systolic murmur due to mildly
incompetent mitral valve caused by the mitral valve prolapse.
Occasionally, complications may develop such as
superimposed infective endocarditis, mitral insufficiency and
arrhythmias. Rarely, sudden death from serious ventricular
arrhythmias may occur.
MYOCARDIAL DISEASE
Involvement of the myocardium occurs in three major forms
of diseases already discussed—ischaemic heart disease,
hypertensive heart disease and rheumatic heart disease. In
addition, there are two other broad groups of isolated
myocardial diseases:
I.
Myocarditis i.e. inflammatory involvement of the
myocardium; and
II. Cardiomyopathy i.e. a non-inflammatory myocardial
involvement with unknown (primary) or known (secondary)
etiology.
MYOCARDITIS
Inflammation of the heart muscle is called myocarditis. It is
a rather common form of heart disease that can occur at any
age. Its exact incidence is difficult to ascertain as the
histological examination has been largely confined to autopsy
material. Reports from different studies have estimated the
incidence of myocarditis in 1 to 4% of all autopsies.
A number of classifications of myocarditis have been
proposed in the past as follows:
Interstitial and parenchymatous type, depending upon
whether the inflammation is confined to interstitial tissue or
the parenchyma.
Specific and non-specific type, depending upon whether the
inflammation is granulomatous or non-specific type.
Acute, subacute and chronic type, depending upon the
duration of inflammatory response.
However, currently most commonly used is etiologic
classification given in Table 16.9.
According to this classification, myocarditis is divided
into 4 main etiologic types described below.
I.
INFECTIVE MYOCARDITIS
A number of infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses,
protozoa, parasites, fungi, rickettsiae and spirochaetes may
cause myocarditis by direct invasion or by their toxins. Some
of the common forms are described below.
1.
VIRAL MYOCARDITIS. A number of viral infections
are associated with myocarditis. Some of the common
examples are influenza, poliomyelitis, infectious mono-
nucleosis, hepatitis, smallpox, chickenpox, measles, mumps,
rubella, viral pneumonias, coxsackievirus and HIV infections.
Cardiac involvement occurs in about 5% of viral infections.
Viral myocarditis usually appears after a few days to a few
weeks of viral infections elsewhere in the body. The damage
to the myocardium is caused either by direct viral cytotoxi-
city or by cell-mediated immune reaction. Regardless of the
type of virus, the pathologic changes are similar.
Grossly, the myocardium is pale and flabby with dila-
tation of the chambers. There may be focal or patchy areas
of necrosis.
Histologically, there are changes of acute myocarditis.
Initially, there is oedema and infiltration of the interstitial
tissue by neutrophils and lymphocytes. Later, there is
necrosis of individual myocardial fibres and the infiltrate
consists of lymphocytes and macrophages.
2.
SUPPURATIVE MYOCARDITIS. Pyogenic bacteria,
chiefly Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, which
cause septicaemia and pyaemia may produce suppurative
myocarditis. As already pointed out, acute bacterial
endocarditis may sometimes cause bacterial myocarditis
(page 445).
Grossly, There are either abscesses in the myocardium
or there is diffuse myocardial involvement.
Microscopically, the exudate chiefly consists of neutro-
phils, admixed with lymphocytes, plasma cells and
macrophages. There may be foci of myocardial degene-
ration and necrosis with areas of healing by fibrosis.

CHAPTER 16
The Heart
3.
TOXIC MYOCARDITIS. A number of acute bacterial
infections produce myocarditis by toxins e.g. in diphtheria,
typhoid fever and pneumococcal pneumonia.
Grossly, the appearance is similar to that seen in viral
myocarditis.
Histologically, there are small foci of coagulative necrosis
in the muscle which are surrounded by nonspecific acute
and chronic inflammatory infiltrate.
Toxic myocarditis manifests clinically by cardiac
arrhythmias or acute cardiac failure due to involvement of
the conduction system. It may cause sudden death.
4.
INFECTIVE GRANULOMATOUS MYOCARDITIS.
Tuberculosis, brucellosis and tularaemia are some examples
of bacterial infections characterised by granulomatous
inflammation in the myocardium. Sarcoidosis, though not a
bacterial infection, has histological resemblance to other
granulomatous myocarditis. Tuberculous myocarditis is rare
and occurs either by haematogenous spread or by extension
from tuberculous pericarditis. The condition must be
distinguished from idiopathic granulomatous (giant cell)
myocarditis (described later).
5.
SYPHILITIC MYOCARDITIS. Syphilitic involvement of
the myocardium may occur in 2 forms—a gummatous lesion
consisting of granulomatous inflammation which is more
common, and a primary non-specific myocarditis which is rare.
The syphilitic gummas in the myocardium may be single or
multiple and may be grossly discernible. The gummas may
affect the conduction system of the heart.
6.
RICKETTSIAL MYOCARDITIS. Myocarditis occurs
quite frequently in scrub typhus (R. tsutsugamushi) and Rocky
Mountain typhus fever caused by spotted rickettsii.
Microscopically, there is interstitial oedema and focal or
patchy infiltration by inflammatory cells which include
lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, mast cells and
eosinophils but necrosis and degeneration are generally
not present.
7.
PROTOZOAL MYOCARDITIS. Chagas’ disease and
toxoplasmosis are the two protozoal diseases causing
myocarditis. Chagas’ disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi
frequently attacks myocardium besides involving the skeletal
muscle and the central nervous system. Toxoplasmosis
caused by intracellular protozoan, Toxoplasma gondii,
sometimes causes myocarditis in children and adults.
Microscopically, both these conditions show focal
degeneration and necrosis of the myocardium, oedema
and cellular infiltrate consisting of histiocytes, plasma
cells, lymphocytes and a few polymorphs.The organisms
are found in the muscle fibres.
8.
HELMINTHIC MYOCARDITIS. Echinococcus granulosus
and Trichinella spiralis are the two intestinal helminths which
may cause myocarditis. Echinococcus rarely produces hydatid
cyst in the myocardium while the larvae of Trichinella in
trichinosis cause heavy inflammation in the myocardium as
well as in the interstitial tissue.
9.
FUNGAL MYOCARDITIS. Patients with immuno-
deficiency, cancer and other chronic debilitating diseases are
more prone to develop fungal myocarditis. These include:
candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, actinomyosis,
cryptococcosis, coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis.
II. IDIOPATHIC (FIEDLER’S) MYOCARDITIS
Idiopathic or Fiedler’s myocarditis is an isolated myocarditis
unaccompanied by inflammatory changes in the
endocardium or pericardium and occurs without the usual
apparent causes. The condition is rapidly progressive and
causes sudden severe cardiac failure or sudden death.
Grossly, the heart is soft and flabby. The cardiac chambers
are generally dilated and sometimes show hypertrophy.
There are yellow-grey focal lesions throughout the
myocardium. Mural thrombi are commonly present.
Histologically, two forms of idiopathic myocarditis are
described: diffuse type and giant cell (idiopathic
granulomatous) type.
i)
Diffuse type is more common of the two. It is
characterised by diffuse non-specific inflammatory infil-
trate consisting of lymphocytes, plasma cells, macro-
phages, eosinophils and a few polymorphs in the inter-
stitial tissue without formation of granulomas. Late stage
shows healing by fibrosis.
ii) Giant cell type or idiopathic granulomatous type is
characterised by formation of non-caseating granulomas
consisting of macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells and
multinucleate giant cells. The giant cells are of foreign
body or Langhans’ type or of myogenic origin. The
granulomas do not show presence of acid-fast bacilli or
spirochaetes. Some have suggested relationship of this
condition with sarcoidosis but sarcoid granulomas are
known to occur in the myocardium secondary to
generalised sarcoidosis.
III. MYOCARDITIS IN CONNECTIVE  TISSUE  DISEASES
Inflammatory involvement of the myocardium occurs in a
number of connective tissue diseases such as rheumatoid
arthritis, lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa,
dermatomyositis and scleroderma. The pathologic changes
in the heart muscle are similar to the changes seen in other
organs in these conditions as described elsewhere in relevant
chapters.
IV. MISCELLANEOUS TYPES OF MYOCARDITIS
Apart from the above forms of myocarditis, miscellaneous
group consists of myocarditis caused by a variety of agents—
physical and chemical agents, drugs and metabolic
derangements.
1.
Physical agents. Physical agents like contusion of the
myocardium, heat stroke, cardiac surgery and irradiation can
initiate non-specific myocarditis. The features consist of an
infiltrate of neutrophils, eosinophils and mononuclear cells
and shows contraction-band necrosis of the myocardial
fibres.

454
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
2.
Chemical agents. Toxic chemicals such as arsenic, phos-
phorus and carbon monoxide cause focal areas of
degeneration and necrosis of myocardial fibres and non-
specific inflammatory reaction, chiefly consisting of
lymphocytes and macrophages.
3.
Drugs. Changes similar to those induced by chemical
poisons are produced by certain drugs such as phenothiazine
compounds, sulfonamides, catecholamines and cytotoxic
compounds.
4.
Immunologic agents. Myasthenia gravis, Friedreich’s
ataxia, and progressive muscular dystrophies initiate a state
of autoimmunisation against the myocardium resulting in
focal myocardial degeneration and necrosis with secondary
inflammatory reaction. Later, there may be myocardial
fibrosis.
5.
Metabolic derangements. Uraemia, hypokalaemia and
shock are associated with degeneration and necrosis of the
myocardial fibres, oedema of the interstitial tissue and non-
specific inflammatory reaction.
CARDIOMYOPATHY
Cardiomyopathy literally means disease of the heart muscle
but the term was originally coined to restrict its usage to
myocardial disease of unknown cause. The WHO definition of
cardiomyopathy also excludes heart muscle diseases of
known etiologies. However, the term cardiomyopathy has
been loosely used by various workers for myocardial diseases
of known etiology as well e.g. alcoholic cardiomyopathy,
amyloid cardiomyopathy, ischaemic cardiomyopathy etc.
This controversy is resolved by classifying all cardiomyo-
pathies into two broad groups:
a) primary cardiomyopathy; and
b) secondary cardiomyopathy i.e. myocardial disease with
known underlying cause.
Based on these principles, a classification of primary
cardiomyopathy and its subtypes is presented in Table 16.10.
A. PRIMARY CARDIOMYOPATHY
This is a group of myocardial diseases of unknown cause. It
is subdivided into the following 3 pathophysiologic
categories (Fig. 16.33):
1.
Idiopathic dilated (congestive) cardiomyopathy.
2.
Idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
3.
Idiopathic restrictive or obliterative or infiltrative
cardiomyopathy.
Idiopathic Dilated (Congestive) Cardiomyopathy
This type of cardiomyopathy is characterised by gradually
progressive cardiac failure along with dilatation of all the
four chambers of the heart. The condition occurs more often
in adults and the average survival from onset to death is less
than 5 years. Though the etiology is unknown, a few
hypotheses based on associations with the following
conditions have been proposed:
i) Possible association of viral myocarditis (especially
coxsackievirus B) with dilated cardiomyopathy, due to
presence of viral nucleic acids in the myocardium, has been
noted.
ii) Association with toxic damage from cobalt and
chemotherapy with doxorubicin and other anthracyclines is
implicated in some cases.
iii) Inherited mutations have been implicated due to occurrence
of disease in families. Mutations in certain sarcomere proteins
such as cardiac troponin-T and I, β-and α-myosin, and
α-cardiac actin have been observed. Abnormality in protein

The Heart
due to mutations causes contractile dysfunction. Another
mutation in cytoskeletal protein dystrophin gene on
X-chromosome has been held responsible for muscular
dystrophy as well as dilated cardiomyopathy.
iv) Chronic alcoholism has been found associated with dilated
cardiomyopathy. It may be due to thiamine deficiency
induced by alcohol and resulting in beri-beri heart disease
(Chapter 9). This is referred to as ‘alcoholic cardiomyopathy’
and included by some workers as one of the subtypes of
secondary cardiomyopathy. However, moderate consump-
tion of alcohol provides some cardioprotection against IHD
by raising HDL cholesterol. Another form of alcoholic
cardiomyopathy is associated with consumption of large
quantities of beer (beer drinkers’ myocardiosis). Cobalt added
to the beer so as to improve the appearance of foam is thought
to cause direct toxic injury to the heart in this condition.
v) Peripartum association has been observed in some cases.
Poorly-nourished women may develop this form of
cardiomyopathy within a month before or after delivery
(peripartum cardiomyopathy).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the heart is en-
larged and increased in weight (up to 1000 gm). The most
characteristic feature is prominent dilatation of all the four
chambers giving the heart typical globular appearance.
Thickening of the ventricular walls even if present is
masked by the ventricular dilatation (Fig. 16.33,A). The
endocardium is thickened and mural thrombi are often
found in the ventricles and atria. The cardiac valves are
usually normal.
Microscopically, The endomyocardial biopsies or autopsy
examination of the heart reveal non-specific and variable
changes. There may be hypertrophy of some myocardial
fibres and atrophy of others. Sometimes degenerative
changes and small areas of interstitial fibrosis are found
with focal mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate.
Idiopathic Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
This form of cardiomyopathy is known by various synonyms
like asymmetrical hypertrophy, hypertrophic subaortic
stenosis and Teare’s disease. The disease occurs more
frequently between the age of 25 and 50 years. It is often
asymptomatic but becomes symptomatic due to heavy
physical activity causing dyspnoea, angina, congestive heart
failure and even sudden death. Though idiopathic, following
factors have been implicated:
i)
Autosomal dominant inheritance of the disease is available
in about half the cases suggesting genetic factors in its
causation.
ii) Inherited mutations in genes encoding for sarcomere
proteins have been reported in much larger number of cases
of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than those of dilated
cardiomyopathy. Particularly implicated are the mutations
in heavy and light chains of cardiac β-myosin, troponin-I and
troponin-T. The condition may result from myocardial
ischaemia resulting in fibrosis of the intramyocardial arteries
and compensatory hypertrophy.
iii) Other contributory factors are: increased circulating level
of catecholamines, myocardial ischaemia as a result of
thickened vasculature of the myocardium and abnormally
increased fibrous tissue in the myocardium due to
hypertrophy.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the characteristic
features are cardiac enlargement, increase in weight,
normal or small ventricular cavities and myocardial
hypertrophy. The hypertrophy of the myocardium is
typically asymmetrical and affects the interventricular
septum more than the free walls of the ventricles
(Fig. 16.33,B). This asymmetric septal hypertrophy may
be confined to the apical region of the septum (non-
obstructive type) or may extend up to the level of the mitral
valve causing obstruction to left ventricular outflow in
the form of subaortic stenosis (obstructive type). The
designation of rhabdomyoma of the septum was applied to
this form of cardiomyopathy in the old literature.
Microscopically, the classical feature is the myocardial
cell disorganisation in the ventricular septum. The bundles
of myocardial fibres are irregularly and haphazardly
arranged rather than the usual parallel pattern and are
separated by bands of interstitial fibrous tissue. The
individual muscle cells show hypertrophy and large
prominent nuclei.
Idiopathic Restrictive (Obliterative or Infiltrative)
Cardiomyopathy
This form of cardiomyopathy is characterised by restriction
in ventricular filling due to reduction in the volume of the
ventricles. The common feature in this heterogeneous group
of conditions producing restrictive cardiomyopathy is
abnormal diastolic function. Restrictive cardiomyopathy
includes the following entities:
i)
Cardiac amyloidosis
ii) Endocardial fibroelastosis
iii) Endomyocardial fibrosis
iv) Löeffler’s endocarditis (Fibroplastic parietal endocarditis
with peripheral blood eosinophilia)
v)  Other forms of restrictive cardiomyopathy.
I)
CARDIAC AMYLOIDOSIS. Amyloidosis of the heart
may occur in any form of systemic amyloidosis or may occur
as isolated organ amyloidosis in amyloid of aging and result
in subendocardial deposits (Chapter 4).
II) ENDOCARDIAL FIBROELASTOSIS. This is an
unusual and uncommon form of heart disease occurring
predominantly in infants and children under 2 years of age
and less often in adults. The infantile form is clinically
characterised by sudden breathlessness, cyanosis, cardiac
failure and death whereas the symptoms in the adult form
last for longer duration. The etiology of the condition remains
obscure. However, a number of theories have been proposed.
These are as under:
a) The infantile form is believed to be congenital in origin
occurring due to the effect of intrauterine endocardial anoxia.
The adult form may also be induced by anoxia-causing

456
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
lesions such as anomalous coronary arteries, metabolic
derangements influencing myocardial function etc.
b) It may occur due to haemodynamic pressure overload such
as in congenital septal defects and coarctation of the aorta.
c)
It may be an expression of genetic disorder as noticed in
twins, triplets and siblings. Association of endocardial
fibroelastosis with various congenital malformations in the
heart or elsewhere further supports the genetic theory.
d) Some workers consider this disease a form of connective
tissue disorder.
e) Certain factors causing myocardial injury may initiate the
endocardial disease such as in thiamine deficiency (beri-beri
heart disease) or from preceding idiopathic myocarditis.
f)
Lymphatic obstruction of the heart has been suggested by
some as the causative mechanism.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the characteristic
feature is the diffuse or patchy, rigid, pearly-white
thickening of the mural endocardium (Fig. 16.33,C). Left
ventricle is predominantly involved, followed in
decreasing frequency by the left atrium, right ventricle
and right atrium. Quite often, the valves, especially of the
left heart, are affected. Some cases contain mural thrombi.
Enlargement of the heart is present and is mainly due to
left ventricular hypertrophy but the volume of the
chamber is decreased.
Microscopically, the typical finding is the proliferation
of the collagen and elastic tissue (fibroelastosis)
comprising the thickened endocardium. The fibroelastosis
generally does not extend into the subjacent myocardium.
The lesion is devoid of inflammatory cells.
III) ENDOMYOCARDIAL FIBROSIS. This form of
restrictive cardiomyopathy is a tropical condition prevalent
in Africa, especially in Uganda and Nigeria, but some cases
occur in South India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and tropical South
America. It is seen in children and young adults. The clinical
manifestations consist of congestive heart failure of unknown
cause just as in adult variety of endocardial fibroelastosis.
The etiology of the condition remains obscure but the
geographic distribution suggests the role of certain factors
like malnutrition, viral infections and heavy consumption
of banana (rich in serotonin).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, endomyocardial
fibrosis is characterised by fibrous scarring of the ventri-
cular endocardium that extends to involve the inner third
of the myocardium. The atrioventricular valve leaflets are
often affected but the semilunar valves are uninvolved.
Mural thrombi may be present. The heart may be normal-
sized or hypertrophied but the volume of the affected
chambers is diminished due to fibrous scarring.
Microscopically, the endocardium and parts of inner third
of the myocardium show destruction of normal tissue and
replacement by fibrous tissue. The condition differs from
endocardial fibroelastosis in having mononuclear
inflammatory cell infiltrate and lacking in elastic tissue.
The superficial layer may show dense hyalinised
connective tissue and even calcification.
IV) LÖEFFLER’S ENDOCARDITIS. Also known by the
more descriptive term of ‘fibroplastic parietal endocarditis
with peripheral blood eosinophilia’, the condition is
considered by some as a variant of the entity described above,
endomyocardial fibrosis. However, it differs from the latter
in following respects:
a) There is generally a peripheral blood eosinophilic
leucocytosis.
b) The inflammatory infiltrate in the endocardium and in
the part of affected myocardium chiefly consists of
eosinophils.
c)
The condition has a worse prognosis.
V) OTHER FORMS OF RESTRICTIVE CARDIOMYO-
PATHY. Besides above, restrictive cardiomyopathy may
result from various diverse causes as under:
i) Haemochromatosis due to iron overload from multiple
transfusions, haemoglobinopathies.
ii) Myocardial sarcoidosis.
iii) Carcinoid syndrome.
iv)  Scleroderma.
v) Neoplastic infiltration in the heart.
B. SECONDARY CARDIOMYOPATHY
This is a group of myocardial diseases of known etiologies
or having clinical associations. This, however, excludes well-
defined entities such as ischaemic, hypertensive, valvular,
pericardial, congenital and inflammatory involvements of the
heart. The main entities included in this group are described
elsewhere in the text and are listed below:
1.
Nutritional disorders e.g. chronic alcoholism, thiamine
deficiency causing beri-beri heart disease (Chapter 9).
2.
Toxic chemicals e.g. cobalt, arsenic, lithium and
hydrocarbons.
3.
Drugs e.g. cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, cate-
cholamines.
4.
Metabolic diseases e.g. amyloidosis, haemochromatosis,
glycogen storage diseases, hypo-and hyperthyroidism, hypo-
and hyperkalaemia.
5.
Neuromuscular diseases e.g. Friedreich’s ataxia, muscular
dystrophies.
6.
Infiltrations e.g. from leukaemia and carcinoma.
7.
Connective tissue diseases e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, syste-
mic sclerosis, dermatomyositis, lupus erythematosus.
PERICARDIAL DISEASE
Diseases of the pericardium are usually secondary to, or
associated with, other cardiac and systemic diseases. They
are broadly of 2 types:
I.
Pericardial fluid accumulations
II. Pericarditis
PERICARDIAL FLUID ACCUMULATIONS
Accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac may be watery
or pure blood. Accordingly, it is of 2 types: hydropericardium
(pericardial effusion) and haemopericardium.

457
CHAPTER 16
The Heart
A. HYDROPERICARDIUM (PERICARDIAL EFFUSION).
Accumulation of fluid in the pericardial cavity due to non-
inflammatory causes is called hydropericardium or
pericardial effusion. Normally, the pericardial cavity contains
30 to 50 ml of clear watery fluid. Considerable quantities of
fluid (up to 1000 ml) can be accommodated in the pericardial
cavity without seriously affecting the cardiac function if the
accumulation is slow. But sudden accumulation of a smaller
volume (up to 250 ml) may produce deficient diastolic filling
of the cardiac chambers (cardiac tamponade). Pericardial
effusion is detected by cardiac enlargement in the X-rays and
by faint apex beat.
The various types of effusions and their causes are as
follows:
1.
Serous effusions. This is the most common type
occurring in conditions in which there is generalised oedema
e.g. in cardiac (in CHF), renal, nutritional and hepatic causes.
The serous effusion is clear, watery, straw-coloured with
specific gravity less than 1.015 (transudate). The serosal
surface is smooth and glistening.
2.
Serosanguineous effusion. This type is found following
blunt trauma to chest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
3.
Chylous effusion. Milky or chylous fluid accumulates
in conditions causing lymphatic obstruction.
4.
Cholesterol effusion. This is a rare type of fluid accumu-
lation characterised by the presence of cholesterol crystals
such as in myxoedema.
B. HAEMOPERICARDIUM. Accumulation of pure blood
in the pericardial sac is termed haemopericardium. The
condition must be distinguished from haemorrhagic
pericarditis in which there is escape of small quantities of
blood into the pericardial cavity. Massive and sudden
bleeding into the sac causes compression of the heart leading
to cardiac tamponade. The causes of haemopericardium are
as under:
i)
Rupture of the heart through a myocardial infarct.
ii) Rupture of dissecting aneurysm.
iii) Bleeding diathesis such as in scurvy, acute leukaemias,
thrombocytopenia.
iv) Trauma following cardiopulmonary resuscitation or by
laceration of a coronary artery.
PERICARDITIS
Pericarditis is the inflammation of the pericardial layers and
is generally secondary to diseases in the heart or caused by
systemic diseases. Primary or idiopathic pericarditis is quite
rare. Based on the morphologic appearance, pericarditis is
classified into acute and chronic types, each of which may
have several etiologies. Acute and chronic pericarditis has
further subtypes based on the character of the exudate
(Table 16.11).
A. Acute Pericarditis
Acute bacterial and non-bacterial pericarditis are the most
frequently encountered forms of pericarditis. These may have
the following subtypes:
1.
SEROUS PERICARDITIS. Acute pericarditis may be
accompanied by accumulation of serous effusion which
differs from transudate of hydropericardium in having
increased protein content and higher specific gravity. Its
various causes are as under:
i)
Viral infection e.g. coxsackie A or B viruses, influenza
virus, mumps virus, adenovirus and infectious mono-
nucleosis.
ii) Rheumatic fever.
iii) Rheumatoid arthritis.
iv) Systemic lupus erythematosus.
v) Involvement of the pericardium by malignant tumour in
the vicinity e.g. carcinoma lung, mesothelioma and
mediastinal tumours.
vi) Tuberculous pericarditis in the early stage.
The fluid accumulation is generally not much and ranges
from 50 to 200 ml but may rarely be large enough to cause
cardiac tamponade.
Microscopically, the epicardial and pericardial surfaces
show infiltration by some neutrophils, lymphocytes and
histiocytes. The fluid usually resorbs with the resolution
of underlying disease.
2.
FIBRINOUS AND SEROFIBRINOUS PERICARDITIS.
The response of the pericardium by fibrinous exudate is the
most common type of pericarditis. Quite often, there is
admixture of fibrinous exudate with serous fluid. The various
causes of this type of pericarditis are as follows:
i)
Uraemia
ii) Myocardial infarction
iii) Rheumatic fever
iv) Trauma such as in cardiac surgery
v) Acute bacterial infections.
The amount of fluid accumulation is variable. The cardiac
surface is characteristically covered by dry or moist, shaggy,
fibrinous exudate which gives ‘bread and butter’ appearance.
Clinically, these cases manifest by friction rub. In less
extensive cases of fibrinous or serofibrinous pericarditis,
there is complete resorption of the exudate. In cases with
advanced fibrinous exudate, pericarditis heals by
organisation and develops fibrous adhesions resulting in
adhesive pericarditis.
3.
PURULENT OR FIBRINOPURULENT PERICARDI-
TIS. Purulent or fibrinopurulent pericarditis is mainly caused

Systemic Pathology
by pyogenic bacteria (e.g. staphylococci, streptococci and
pneumococci) and less frequently by fungi and parasites. The
infection may spread to the pericardium by the following
routes:
i)
By direct extension from neighbouring inflammation e.g.
in empyema of the pleural cavity, lobar pneumonia, infective
endocarditis and mediastinal infections.
ii) By haematogenous spread.
iii) By lymphatic permeation.
iv) Direct implantation during cardiac surgery.
Generally, fibrinous or serofibrinous pericarditis precedes
the development of purulent pericarditis. The amount of
exudate is variable and is generally thick, creamy pus, coating
the pericardial surfaces.
Microscopically, besides the purulent exudate on the
pericardial surfaces, the serosal layers show dense
infiltration by neutrophils (Fig. 16.34). Purulent exudate
generally does not resolve completely but instead heals
by organisation resulting in adhesive or chronic
constrictive pericarditis.
4.
HAEMORRHAGIC PERICARDITIS. Haemorrhagic
pericarditis is the one in which the exudate consists of
admixture of an inflammatory effusion of one of the foregoing
types alongwith blood. The causes are as under:
i)
Neoplastic involvement of the pericardium
ii) Haemorrhagic diathesis with effusion
iii) Tuberculosis
iv) Severe acute infections
The outcome of haemorrhagic pericarditis is generally
similar to that of purulent pericarditis.
B. Chronic Pericarditis
Chronic pericarditis is the term used for tuberculous
pericarditis and the healed stage of one of the various forms
of acute pericarditis already described. Included under this
are: tuberculous pericarditis, chronic adhesive pericarditis,
chronic constrictive pericarditis, and the pericardial plaques.
1.
TUBERCULOUS PERICARDITIS. Tuberculous peri-
carditis is the most frequent form of granulomatous
inflammation of the pericardium. The lesions may occur by
one of the following mechanisms:
i)
Direct extension from an adjacent focus of tuberculosis.
ii) By lymphatic spread e.g. from tracheobronchial lymph
nodes, chronic pulmonary tuberculosis or infected pleura.
The exudate is slightly turbid, caseous or blood-stained
with sufficient fibrin. Tubercles are generally visible on the
pericardial surfaces and sometimes caseous areas are also
visible to the naked eye.
Microscopically, typical tuberculous granulomas with
caseation necrosis are seen in the pericardial wall. The
lesions generally do not resolve but heal by fibrosis and
calcification resulting in chronic constrictive pericarditis.
2.
CHRONIC ADHESIVE PERICARDITIS. Chronic
adhesive pericarditis is the stage of organisation and healing
by formation of fibrous adhesions in the pericardium
following preceding fibrinous, suppurative or haemorrhagic
pericarditis. The process begins by formation of granulation
tissue and neovascularisation. Subsequently, fibrous
adhesions develop between the parietal and the visceral
layers of the pericardium and obliterate the pericardial space
(Fig. 16.35,A). Sometimes, fibrous adhesions develop
between the parietal pericardium and the adjacent
mediastinum and is termed as adhesive mediastinopericarditis.
Chronic adhesive pericarditis differs from chronic
constrictive pericarditis in not embarrassing the function of
the heart. However, cardiac hypertrophy and dilatation may
occur in severe cases due to increased workload.
3.
CHRONIC CONSTRICTIVE PERICARDITIS. This is
a rare condition characterised by dense fibrous or fibrocalcific
thickening of the pericardium resulting in mechanical
interference with the function of the heart and reduced
cardiac output. The condition usually results from a long-
standing preceding causes, e.g.
i)
Tuberculous pericarditis
ii) Purulent pericarditis
iii) Haemopericardium
iv) Concato’s disease (polyserositis)
v) Rarely, acute non-specific and viral pericarditis.
The heart is encased in 0.5 to 1 cm thick and dense
collagenous scar which may be calcified. As a result, the heart
fails to dilate during diastole. The dense fibrocollagenous
tissue may cause narrowing of the openings of the vena
cavae, resulting in obstruction to the venous return to the
right heart and consequent right heart failure. In contrast to
chronic adhesive pericarditis, hypertrophy and dilatation do
not occur due to dense fibrous scarring. Instead, the heart
size is normal or smaller (Fig. 16.35,B).
4.
PERICARDIAL PLAQUES (MILK SPOTS, SOLDIERS’
SPOTS). These are opaque, white, shining and well-
circumscribed areas of organisation with fibrosis in the
Figure 16.34
Fibrinopurulent pericarditis. The pericardium is covered
with pink serofibrinous exudates. The space between the layers of the
pericardium contains numerous inflammatory cells, chiefly PMNs.

459
CHAPTER 16
The Heart
pericardium measuring 1 to 3 cm in diameter. They are seen
most frequently on the anterior surface of the right ventricle.
The exact cause is not known but they are generally believed
to arise from healing of preceding pericarditis. The plaque-
like lesions of pericardial thickenings are also termed milk
spots or soldiers’ spots as they were often found at autopsy in
the soldiers in World War I who carried their shoulder bags
causing pressure against the chest wall by the straps which
produced chronic irritation of the pericardium.
TUMOURS OF THE HEART
Tumours of the heart are classified into primary and
secondary, the latter being more common than the former.
PRIMARY TUMOURS
Primary tumours of the heart are quite rare, found in 0.04%
of autopsies. In decreasing order of frequency, the benign
tumours encountered in the heart are: myxoma, lipoma,
fibroelastoma, rhabdomyoma, haemangioma and lymph-
angioma. The malignant tumours are still rarer, the important
ones are: rhabdomyosarcoma, angiosarcoma and malignant
mesothelioma. Out of all these, only myxoma of the heart
requires elaboration.
MYXOMA. This is the most common primary tumour of the
heart comprising about 50% of all primary cardiac tumours.
Majority of them occur in the age range of 30 to 60 years.
Myxomas may be located in any cardiac chamber or the
valves, but 90% of them are situated in the left atrium.
Grossly, they are often single but may be multiple. They
range in size from less than 1 to 10 cm, polypoid, pedun-
culated, spherical, soft and haemorrhagic masses
resembling an organising mural thrombus. Some
investigators actually consider them to be organising
mural thrombi rather than true neoplasms.
Microscopically, the tumour shows the following features:
i)
There is abundant myxoid or mucoid intercellular
stroma positive for mucin.
ii) The cellularity is sparse. The tumour cells are generally
stellate-shaped, spindled and polyhedral, scattered in the
Figure 16.35
Appearance of the heart and the pericardium in chronic
adhesive (A) and chronic constrictive pericarditis (B).
stroma. Occasional multinucleate tumour giant cells are
present.
iii) Numerous capillary-sized blood vessels are found and
the tumour cells may be aggregated around them.
iv) A few lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages are
seen.
v) Foci of haemorrhage and deposits of haemosiderin
granules are often present.
SECONDARY TUMOURS
Metastatic tumours of the heart are more common than the
primary tumours. About 10% cases with disseminated cancer
have metastases in the heart. Most of these result from
haematogenous or lymphatic spread. In descending order
of frequency, primary sites of origin are: carcinoma of the
lung, breast, malignant lymphoma, leukaemia and malignant
melanoma. Occasionally, there may be direct extension of a
primary intrathoracic tumour such as carcinoma of the lung
into the pericardium and into the cardiac chambers.
PATHOLOGY OF CARDIOVASCULAR
INTERVENTIONS
Nowadays, with the development of surgical and non-
surgical coronary revascularisation procedures in coronary
artery disease, it has been possible to study the pathology of
native as well as grafted vessel. However, these invasive
therapeutic interventions are done in conjunction with life
style changes for modifying the risk factors. Besides, the
myocardial tissue by endomyocardial biopsy is also
accessible for histopathologic study.
ENDOMYOCARDIAL BIOPSY
Currently, it is possible to perform endomyocardial biopsy
(EMB) for making a final histopathologic diagnosis in certain
cardiac diseases. The main indications for EMB are:
myocarditis, cardiac transplant cases, restrictive heart
disease, infiltrative heart diseases such as in amyloidosis,
storage disorders etc.
 EMB is done by biopsy forceps introduced via cardiac
catheter into either of the ventricles but preferably right
ventricle is biopsied for its relative ease and safety. The route
for the catheter may be through internal jugular vein or
femoral vein for accessing the right ventricle.
BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY
Balloon angioplasty or percutaneous coronary intervention
(PCI) is a non-surgical procedure that employs percutaneous
insertion and manipulation of a balloon catheter into the
occluded coronary artery. The balloon is inflated to dilate
the stenotic artery which causes endothelial damage, plaque
fracture, medial dissection and haemorrhage in the affected
arterial wall. PCI is accompanied with insertion of coronary
stents in the blocked coronaries with a success rate of
symptoms in over 95% cases. However, case selection for
PCI is important and major indications are 2 or 3 vessel block

460
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
but blockage of left main coronary is a contraindication for
PCI. Unstable angioplasty may be associated with acute
coronary syndromes. PCI is followed by administration of
anti-platelet (oral aspirin) and antithrombin therapy to avoid
occurrence of coronary thrombosis.
Recurrent stenosis after metal stenting in PCI may occur
within 6 months in about 20% patients, more often in patients
of diabetes mellitus. Restenosis is multifactorial in etiology
that includes smooth muscle cell proliferation, extracellular
matrix and local thrombosis. However, widespread use of
drug-delivering stents has made it possible to overcome
several long-term complications of coronary stening.
Currently, stents  with anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory,
cytotoxic and cytostatic agents are commercially available.
CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING
Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) employs the use of
autologous grafts to replace or bypass the blocked coronary
arteries. Most frequently used is autologous graft of
saphenous vein which is reversed (due to valves in the vein)
and transplanted, or left internal mammary artery may be
used being in the operative area of the heart. Long-term
follow-up of CABG surgery has yielded following obser-
vations on pathology of grafted vessel:
1.
In a reversed saphenous vein graft, long-term luminal
patency is 50% after 10 years. Pathologic changes which
develop in grafted vein include thrombosis in early stage,
intimal thickening and graft atherosclerosis with or without
complicated lesions.
2.
Internal mammary artery graft, however, has a patency
of more than 90% after 10 years.
3.
Atherosclerosis with superimposed complications may
develop in native coronary artery distal to the grafted vessel
as well as in the grafted vessel.
CARDIAC  TRANSPLANTATION
Since the first human-to-human cardiac transplant was
carried out successfully by South African surgeon Dr
Christian Barnard in 1967, cardiac transplantation and
prolonged assisted circulation is being done in many
countries in end-stage cardiac diseases, most often in
idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure and IHD.
Worldwide, about 3,000 cardiac transplants are performed
annually. The survival following heart transplants is reported
as: 1 year in 85%, 5 years in 65% and 10 years in 45% cases.
Major complications are transplant rejection reaction,
infections (particularly with Toxoplasma gondii and
cytomegaloviruses), graft coronary atherosclerosis and
higher incidence of malignancy due to long-term adminis-
tration of immunosuppressive therapy. One of the main
problems in cardiac transplant centres is the availability of
donors.
The concept of cardiac stem cells resident in the heart
and possibly of bone marrow stem cells transdifferentiating
into cardiac myocyte has generated interest in treatment of
patients of IHD with transplantation of these stem cells.
Preliminary studies in IHD cases have yielded encouraging
results in clinical improvement and reduction in infarct size
and hold promise for future.

CHAPTER 17
The Respiratory System
LUNGS
NORMAL STRUCTURE
ANATOMY. The normal adult right lung weighs 375 to 550
gm (average 450 gm) and is divided by two fissures into three
lobes—the upper, middle and lower lobes. The weight of the
normal adult left lung is 325 to 450 gm (average 400 gm) and
has one fissure dividing it into two lobes—the upper and
lower lobes, while the middle lobe is represented by the
lingula. The airways of the lungs arise from the trachea by
its division into right and left main bronchi which continue
to divide and subdivide further, eventually terminating into
the alveolar sacs (Fig. 17.1).
The right main bronchus is more vertical so that aspirated
foreign material tends to pass down to the right lung rather
than to the left. The trachea, major bronchi and their
branchings possess cartilage, smooth muscle and mucous
glands in their walls, while the bronchioles have smooth
muscle but lack cartilage as well as the mucous glands.
Between the tracheal bifurcation and the smallest bronchi,
about 8 divisions take place. The bronchioles so formed further
undergo 3 to 4 divisions leading to the terminal bronchioles
which are less than 2 mm in diameter. The part of the lung
tissue distal to a terminal bronchiole is called an acinus. A
cluster of about 5 acini supplied by terminal bronchioles and
enclosed by visible fibrous septa is termed as the pulmonary
lobule. An acinus consists of 3 parts:
1.
Several (usually 3 to 5 generations) respiratory bronchioles
originate from a terminal bronchiole.
2.
Each respiratory bronchiole divides into several alveolar
ducts.
3.
Each alveolar duct opens into many alveolar sacs (alveoli)
which are blind ends of the respiratory passages.
The lungs have double blood supply—oxygenated blood
from the bronchial arteries and venous blood from the
pulmonary arteries, and there is mixing of the blood to some
extent. In case of blockage of one side of circulation, the
supply from the other can maintain the vitality of pulmonary
parenchyma. The bronchial veins drain the blood supplied
by the bronchial arteries. The lungs have abundant
intercommunicating lymphatics on the surface which drain
into the subpleural plexus. Hilar and tracheobronchial lymph
nodes receive the lymph and drain into the thoracic duct.
HISTOLOGY. The bronchi and their subdivisions up to
bronchioles are lined by pseudostratified columnar ciliated
epithelial cells, also called respiratory epithelium. These cells
are admixed with mucus-secreting goblet cells which
decrease in number as the bronchioles are approached. The
mucosa of bronchi contains numerous submucosal mucous
glands and neuroendocrine cells which are bronchial counter-
parts of the argentaffin cells of the alimentary tract
(Chapter 20). The structure of bronchioles differs from that
of bronchi and its subdivisions as well as from alveoli. They
are lined by a single layer of pseudostratified columnar
ciliated epithelium but no mucus cells and hence, unlike the
bronchi, contain no mucus secretion on the surface. They
contain some nonciliated Clara cells which secrete protein
rich in lysozyme and immunoglobulins but unlike the alveoli
contain no surfactant.
The alveolar walls or alveolar septa are the sites of
exchange between the blood and air and have the following
microscopic features (Fig. 17.2):
1.
The capillary endothelium lines the anastomotic capillaries
in the alveolar walls.
2.
The capillary endothelium and the, alveolar lining
epithelial cells are separated by the capillary basement
membrane and some interstitial tissue. The interstitial tissue
consists of scanty amount of collagen, fibroblasts, fine elastic
fibres, smooth muscle cells, a few mast cells and mononuclear
cells.
3.
The alveolar epithelium consists of 2 types of cells: type I or
membranous pneumocytes are the most numerous covering

Systemic Pathology
about 95% of alveolar surface, while type II or granular
pneumocytes project into the alveoli and are covered by
microvilli. Type II pneumocytes are essentially reserve cells
which undergo compensatory hyperplasia when type I
pneumocytes are injured and are also the source of
pulmonary surfactant rich in lecithin. The main functions of
coating of surfactant are to lower the surface tension of the
alveolar lining cells and in maintaining the stability of the
alveoli.
4.
The alveolar macrophages belonging to mononuclear-
phagocyte system are present either free in the alveolar
spaces or are attached to the alveolar cells.
5.
The pores of Kohn are the sites of alveolar connections
between the adjacent alveoli and allow the passage of bacteria
and exudate.
FUNCTIONS. The primary functions of lungs is oxygenation
of the blood and removal of carbon dioxide. The respiratory
tract is particularly exposed to infection as well as to the
hazards of inhalation of pollutants from the inhaled air and
cigarette smoke. There exists a natural mechanism of filtering
and clearing of such pollutants through respiratory
epithelium, tracheobronchial lymphatics and alveolar
macrophages. Besides, the lungs are the only other organ
after heart through which all the blood of the body passes
during circulation. Therefore, cardiovascular diseases have
serious effects on the lungs, and conversely, diseases of the
lungs which interfere with pulmonary blood flow have
significant effects on the heart and systemic circulation.
Following groups of diseases of the respiratory tract are
studied in this chapter:
1. Paediatric lung disease (congenital and acquired)
2. Pulmonary vascular disease
3. Pulmonary infections
4. Chronic obstructive pulomonary disease
5. Chronic restrictive pulmonary disease
6. Tumours of lungs.
PAEDIATRIC LUNG DISEASE
A number of congenital anomalies (e.g. agenesis, hypoplasia,
heterotopic tissue, vascular anomalies, tracheal and bronchial
anomalies, congenital pulmonary overinflation or lobar
emphysema, congenital cysts and bronchopulmonary
sequestration) and certain neonatal acquired lung diseases
(respiratory distress syndrome or hyaline membrane disease,
bronchopulmonary dysplasia, meconium aspiration
syndrome, persistent foetal circulation, atelactasis, collapse
and bronchiolitis) have been described. Some of the
important conditions from point of view of pathology are
discussed below.
CONGENITAL CYSTS
Developmental defects involving deficiency of bronchial or
bronchiolar cartilage, elastic tissue and muscle result in
congenital cystic disease of lungs. A single large cyst of this
type occupying almost a lobe is called pneumatocele. Multiple
small cysts are more common and give sponge-like
appearance to the lung. The cysts are thin-walled and dilated
and generally lined by flattened ciliated epithelium overlying
a thin layer of supportive connective tissue. These cysts may
contain air or may get infected and become abscesses. Cysts
may rupture into bronchi producing haemoptysis, or into
the pleural cavity producing pneumothorax.
BRONCHOPULMONARY SEQUESTRATION
Sequestration is the presence of lobes or segments of lung
tissue which are not connected to the airway system. The
blood supply of the sequestered area is not from the
pulmonary arteries but from the aorta or its branches.
Sequestration may be intralobar or extralobar.
Intralobar sequestration is the sequestered broncho-
pulmonary mass within the pleural covering of the affected
lung.
Extralobar sequestration is the sequestered mass of lung
tissue lying outside the pleural investing layer such as in the
base of left lung or below the diaphragm. The extralobar
sequestration is predominantly seen in infants and children
and is often associated with other congenital malformations.
ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
(HYALINE MEMBRANE DISEASE)
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe, at
times life-threatening, form of progressive respiratory
insufficiency which involves pulmonary tissues diffusely i.e.
involvement of the alveolar epithelium, alveolar lumina and
interstitial tissue. ARDS exists in 2 forms: neonatal and adult
type. Both have the common morphological feature of
formation of hyaline membrane in the alveoli and hence is

shows capillary endothelium, capillary basement membrane and scanty
interstitial tissue and the alveolar lining cells (type I or membranous
pneumocytes and type II or granular pneumocytes).

CHAPTER 17
The Respiratory System
also termed as hyaline membrane disease (HMD). The two
forms of ARDS have different clinical settings, response to
treatment and consequences, etiology, pathogenesis but have
similar morphology, and hence are discussed together below.
CLINICAL FEATURES AND CONSEQUENCES. These are
as under:
Neonatal ARDS occurring in newborn infants begins
with dyspnoea within a few hours after birth with
tachypnoea, hypoxia and cyanosis; in severe cases death may
occur within a few hours.
Adult ARDS is known by various synonyms such as
shock-lung syndrome, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), acute
alveolar injury, traumatic wet lungs and post-traumatic
respiratory insufficiency. The condition was first recognised
in adults during World War II in survivors of non-thoracic
injuries with shock. Adult ARDS also presents clinically by
sudden and severe respiratory distress, tachypnoea,
tachycardia, cyanosis and severe hypoxaemia.
ETIOLOGY. The two forms of ARDS have distinct etiology:
Neonatal ARDS is primarily initiated by hypoxia, either
shortly before birth or immediately afterward. It occurs in
following clinical settings:
1.
Preterm infants
2.
Infants born to diabetic mothers
3.
Delivery by caesarean section
4.
Infants born to mothers with previous premature infants
5.
Excessive sedation of the mother causing depression in
respiration of the infant
6.
Birth asphyxia from various causes such as coils of
umbilical cord around the neck
7.
Male preponderance (1.5 to 2 times) over female babies
due to early maturation of female lungs
8.
Finally, many cases of neonatal ARDS remain idio-
pathic.
Adult ARDS may occur from the following causes:
1.
Shock due to sepsis, trauma, burns
2.
Diffuse pulmonary infections, chiefly viral pneumonia
3.
Pancreatitis
4.
Oxygen toxicity
5.
Inhalation of toxins and irritants e.g. smoke, war gases,
nitrogen dioxide, metal fumes etc.
6.
Narcotic overdose
7.
Drugs e.g. salicylates, colchicine
8.
Aspiration pneumonitis
9.
Fat embolism
10. Radiation.
PATHOGENESIS. In both neonatal and adult type ARDS,
there is damage to alveolocapillary wall triggered by etiologic
factors listed above, and the final pathologic consequence of
formation of hyaline membrane is also similar. However,
how it occurs is different in the neonates than in adults. The
sequence of events in the pathogenesis of both neonatal and
adult ARDS is schematically illustrated in Fig. 17.3 and is
outlined below:
Neonatal ARDS. Entry of air into alveoli is essential for
formation of hyaline membrane i.e. dead born infants do not develop
HMD.
i)
The basic defect in neonatal ARDS is a deficiency of
pulmonary surfactant, normally synthesised by type II alveolar
cells. The production of surfactant is normally increased
shortly before birth but in prematurity and in neonatal
hypoxia from any of the foregoing causes, its synthesis is
decreased. The main function of alveolar surfactant being
lowering of alveolar surface tension, its deficiency leads to
increased alveolar surface tension which in turn causes
atelectasis.
ii) Atelectasis of the lungs results in hypoventilation, pulmo-
nary hypoperfusion and ischaemic damage to capillary
endothelium.
iii) This results in ischaemic necrosis of the alveolocapillary
wall, exudation of plasma proteins including fibrinogen into
the alveoli and eventually formation of hyaline membrane
on the alveolar surface containing largely fibrin.
Adult ARDS. The mechanism of acute injury by etiologic
agents listed above depends upon the imbalance between pro-
inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines:
i) Activated pulmonay macrophages release proinflammatory
cytokines such as IL8, IL1, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF),
while macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) helps to sustain
inflammation in the alveoli. Number of neutrophils in the
alveoli is increased in acute injury. Neutrophils on activation
release products which cause active tissue injury e.g.
proteases, platelet activating factor, oxidants and
leukotrienes.
ii) Besides the role of cytokines in acute injury, a few fibrogenic
cytokines such as transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) and
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) play a role in repair
process by stimulation of proliferation of fibroblast and
collagen.
In either case, injury to the capillary endothelium leads
to increased vascular permeability while injured
pneumocytes, especially type 1, undergo necrosis. The net
effect of injury to both capillary endothelium and alveolar
epithelium is interstitial and intra-alveolar oedema,
congestion, fibrin deposition and formation of hyaline
membranes. As a result of coating of the alveoli with hyaline
membranes, there is loss of surfactant causing collapse called
‘stiff lung’. There is an attempt at regeneration of alveolar
cells by proliferation of type II alveolar cells so as to increase
the secretion of surfactant.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the lungs are
normal in size. They are characteristically stiff, congested,
heavy  and airless so that they sink in water.
Microscopically, the important features are as follows
(Fig. 17.4):
1.
There is presence of collapsed alveoli (atelectasis) alter-
nating with dilated alveoli.
2.
Necrosis of alveolar epithelial cells and formation of
characteristic eosinophilic hyaline membranes lining the
respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and the proximal
alveoli. The membrane is largely composed of fibrin
admixed with cell debris derived from necrotic alveolar
cells.
3.
Interstitial and intra-alveolar oedema, congestion and
intra-alveolar haemorrhages.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
4.
Changes of bronchopneumonia may supervene.
5.
With time, compensatory proliferation of pneumocytes
into alveolar lumen may be seen as tufts of alveolar
epithelium.
6.
In organising stage, there is interstitial fibrosis
obliterating alveolar spaces.
CONSEQUENCES. ARDS in both neonates and adults can
have following consequences:
Figure 17.3
Schematic representation of sequence of events leading to the formation of hyaline membrane in neonatal and adult acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Histological appearance of hyaline membrane disease. There are alternate areas of collapsed and dilated alveolar spaces, many
of which are lined by eosinophilic hyaline membranes.

465
CHAPTER 17
The Respiratory System
1. Death. The mortality rate in neonatal ARDS is high (20 to
30%) and is still higher in babies under 1 kg of body weight.
The stiff lung in adult ARDS fails to respond to oxygen
therapy and is acutely serious and severe respiratory problem
which may be fatal.
2. Resolution. Milder cases of neonatal ARDS recover with
adequate oxygen therapy by ventilator-assist methods in a
few days, while in adult ARDS control of the trigger which
initiated it may result in resolution. The hyaline membrane
is liquefied by the neutrophils and macrophages and thus
absorbed. The cell debris in alveolar lumina are cleared by
the macrophages and restore the normal aeration of the
alveoli.
3. Other sequelae. Besides the two extremes—death and
recovery, other long-term sequelae of ARDS are as under:
i) Some cases of neonatal ARDS who recover may develop
bronchopulmonary dysplasia later on.
ii) In both neonatal and adult ARDS, there may be develop-
ment of desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) due to
pneumocytes  proliferation supervened with inflammation.
iii) Patients of adult ARDS who survive acute episodes may
develop widespread interstitial fibrosis later and progress
to diffuse fibrosing alveolitis (Hamman Rich syndrome).
BRONCHOPULMONARY DYSPLASIA
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia occurs as a complication in
infants treated for neonatal ARDS with oxygen and assisted
ventilation. The toxicity of oxygen and barotrauma from high
pressure of oxygen give rise to subacute or chronic fibrosing
condition of the lungs termed bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
The condition is clinically characterised by persistence of
respiratory distress for upto 3 to 6 months.
Microscopically, there is organisation of hyaline memb-
ranes resulting in fibrous thickening of the alveolar walls,
bronchiolitis, peribronchial fibrosis, and development of
emphysema due to alveolar dilatation. Many bronchioles
show squamous metaplasia.
ATELECTASIS AND COLLAPSE
Atelectasis in the newborn or primary atelectasis is defined as
incomplete expansion of a lung or part of a lung, while
pulmonary collapse or secondary atelectasis is the term used
for reduction in lung size of a previously expanded and well-
aerated lung. Obviously, the former occurs in newborn
whereas the latter may occur at any age.
ATELECTASIS. Stillborn infants have total atelectasis, while
the newborn infants with weak respiratory action develop
incomplete expansion of the lungs and clinical atelectasis.
The common causes are prematurity, cerebral birth injury,
CNS malformations and intrauterine hypoxia.
Grossly, the lungs are small, dark blue, fleshy and non-
crepitant
Microscopically, the alveolar spaces in the affected area
are small with thick interalveolar septa. The alveolar
spaces contain proteinaceous fluid with a few epithelial
squames and meconium. Scattered aerated areas of the
lung are hyperinflated causing interstitial emphysema and
pneumothorax.
COLLAPSE. Pulmonary collapse or secondary atelectasis in
children and adults may occur from various causes such as
compression, obstruction, contraction and lack of pulmonary
surfactant. Accordingly, collapse may be of the following
types:
1.
Compressive collapse. Pressure from outside causes
compressive collapse e.g. by massive pleural effusion,
haemothorax, pneumothorax, intrathoracic tumour, high
diaphragm and spinal deformities. Compressive collapse
involves subpleural regions and affects lower lobes more than
the central areas.
2.
Obstructive/absorptive collapse. Obstruction of a
bronchus or many bronchioles causes absorption of oxygen
in the affected alveoli followed by collapse e.g. by viscid
mucus secretions in bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis,
bronchiectasis, bronchial tumours and aspiration of foreign
bodies. Obstructive collapse is generally less severe than the
compressive collapse and is patchy.
3.
Contraction collapse. This type occurs due to localised
fibrosis in lung causing contraction followed by collapse.
BRONCHIOLITIS AND BRONCHIOLITIS OBLITERANS
Bronchiolitis and bronchiolitis obliterans are the inflam-
matory conditions affecting the small airways occurring
predominantly in older paediatric age group and in quite
elderly persons. A number of etiologic factors have been
stated to cause this condition. These include viral infection
(frequently adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus),
bacterial infection, fungal infection, inhalation of toxic gases
(e.g. in silo-fillers’ disease) and aspiration of gastric contents.
Microscopically, the lumina of affected bronchioles are
narrow and occluded by fibrous plugs. The bronchiolar
walls are inflamed and are infiltrated by lymphocytes and
plasma cells. There are changes of interstitial pneumonitis
and fibrosis in the alveoli around the affected bronchioles.
SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME
Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or crib death is an
uncommon condition seen mainly in the western countries.
It affects infants in the age group of 2 to 6 months. The
condition is seen in premature babies born to mothers who
have been smokers and indulged in drug abuse.
Microscopically, at autopsy the upper respiratory airways
and lungs invariably show petechial haemorrhages.
PULMONARY VASCULAR DISEASE
As stated before, diseases of the heart affect the lungs and
diseases of the lungs affect the heart. This is because of the
peculiar characteristics of pulmonary vasculature. The
pressure in the pulmonary arteries is much lower than in
the systemic arteries. The pulmonary arterial system is

466
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
thinner than the systemic arterial system. They are thin elastic
vessels which can be easily distinguished from thick-walled
bronchial arteries supplying the large airways and the pleura.
General diseases of vascular origin occurring in the lungs
such as pulmonary oedema, pulmonary congestion,
pulmonary embolism and pulmonary infarction, have all
been already discussed in Chapter 5. The other important
disease of pulmonary alveocapillary wall, ARDS, has already
been discussed above. Here, an account of pulmonary
hypertension is given.
PULMONARY HYPERTENSION
Normally, the pulmonary arterial circulation is high-flow and
low-pressure system with much lower blood pressure than
the systemic blood pressure; it does not exceed 30/15 mmHg
even during exercise (normally, blood pressure in the
pulmonary veins is between 3 and 8 mmHg). Pulmonary
hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure in the
pulmonary arterial circulation above 30 mmHg. Pulmonary
hypertension is broadly classified into 2 groups: primary
(idiopathic) and secondary; the latter being more common.
Primary (Idiopathic) Pulmonary Hypertension
Primary or idiopathic pulmonary hypertension is an
uncommon condition of unknown cause. The diagnosis can
be established only after a thorough search for the usual
causes of secondary pulmonary hypertension (discussed
below). The patients are usually young females between the
age of 20 and 40 years, or children around 5 years of age.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Though the etiology of primary
pulmonary hypertension is unknown, a number of etiologic
factors have been suggested to explain its pathogenesis:
1.
A neurohumoral vasoconstrictor mechanism may be invol-
ved leading to chronic vasoconstriction that induces
pulmonary hypertension.
2.
The occurrence of disease in young females has promp-
ted a suggestion that unrecognised thromboemboli or amniotic
fluid emboli during pregnancy may play a role.
3.
There is a suggestion that primary pulmonary hyper-
tension may be a form of collagen vascular disease. This is
supported by occurrence of Raynaud’s phenomenon
preceding the onset of this disease by a number of years in
many patients, and disease association with SLE, scleroderma
and rheumatoid arthritis.
4.
Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease characterised by fibrous
obliteration of small pulmonary veins is believed to be
responsible for some cases of primary pulmonary
hypertension, especially in children. This is generally
considered a consequence of thrombosis or vasculitis.
5.
Ingestion of substances like ‘bush tea’, oral contraceptives
and appetite depressant agents like aminorex are believed
to be related to primary pulmonary hypertension.
6.
Familial occurrence has been reported in a number of cases.
Secondary Pulmonary Hypertension
When pulmonary hypertension occurs secondary to a
recognised lesion in the heart or lungs, it is termed as
secondary pulmonary hypertension. It is the more common
type and may be encountered at any age, but more frequently
over the age of 50 years.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Based on the underlying
mechanism, causes of secondary pulmonary hypertension
are divided into the following 3 groups:
A. Passive pulmonary hypertension. This is the commonest
and is produced by diseases raising pressure in the
pulmonary veins e.g.
1.
Mitral stenosis.
2.
Chronic left ventricular failure (e.g. in severe systemic
hypertension, aortic stenosis, myocardial fibrosis).
B. Hyperkinetic (Reactive) pulmonary hypertension. In
this group are included causes in which the blood enters the
pulmonary arteries in greater volume or at a higher pressure.
For example:
1.
Patent ductus arteriosus.
2.
Atrial or ventricular septal defects.
C. Vaso-occlusive pulmonary hypertension. All such
conditions which produce progressive diminution of the
vascular bed in the lungs are included in this group. Vaso-
occlusive causes may be further sub-divided into 3 types:
1.
Obstructive type, in which there is block in the pulmonary
circulation e.g.
i)
Multiple emboli or thrombi
ii) Sickle cell disease
iii) Schistosomiasis
2.
Obliterative type, in which there is reduction of pulmo-
nary vascular bed by chronic parenchymal lung diseases e.g.
i)
Chronic emphysema
ii) Chronic bronchitis
iii) Bronchiectasis
iv) Pulmonary tuberculosis
v) Pneumoconiosis
3.
Vasoconstrictive type, in which there is widespread and
sustained hypoxic vasoconstriction and alveolar hyper-
ventilation leading to pulmonary hypertension e.g.
i)
In residents at high altitude
ii) Pathologic obesity (Pickwickian disease)
iii) Upper airway disease such as tonsillar hypertrophy
iv) Neuromuscular diseases such as poliomyelitis
v) Severe kyphoscoliosis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Irrespective of the type of
pulmonary hypertension (primary or secondary), chronic
cases invariably lead to cor pulmonale (Chapter 16). The
pathologic changes are confined to the right side of the
heart and pulmonary arterial tree in the lungs. There is
hypertrophy of the right ventricle and dilatation of the
right atrium. The vascular changes are similar in primary
and secondary types and involve the entire arterial tree
from the main pulmonary arteries down to the arterioles.
These changes are as under (Fig. 17.5):
1.
Arterioles and small pulmonary arteries: These
branches show most conspicuous changes. These are as
follows:
i)
Medial hypertrophy.

467
CHAPTER 17
The Respiratory System
ii) Thickening and reduplication of elastic laminae.
iii) Plexiform pulmonary arteriopathy in which there is
intraluminal tuft of capillary formation in dilated thin-
walled arterial branches. These lesions are not so marked
in secondary pulmonary hypertension.
2.
Medium-sized pulmonary arteries:
i)
Medial hypertrophy, which is not so marked in
secondary pulmonary hypertension.
ii) Concentric intimal thickening.
iii) Adventitial fibrosis.
iv) Thickening and reduplication of elastic laminae.
3.
Large pulmonary arteries:
i) Atheromatous deposits.
PULMONARY INFECTIONS
Acute and chronic pulmonary infections are common at all
ages and are a frequent cause of death. They are generally
caused by a wide variety of microorganisms such as bacteria,
viruses, fungi and mycoplasma. Important and common
examples of acute pulmonary infectious diseases discussed
here are pneumonias, lung abscess and fungal infections, while
pulmonary tuberculosis, generally regarded as an example of
chronic lung infections, is discussed in Chapter 6.
PNEUMONIAS
Pneumonia is defined as acute inflammation of the lung
parenchyma distal to the terminal bronchioles (consisting of
the respiratory bronchiole, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs and
alveoli). The terms ‘pneumonia’ and ‘pneumonitis’ are often
used synonymously for inflammation of the lungs, while
‘consolidation’ (meaning solidification) is the term used for
gross and radiologic appearance of the lungs in pneumonia.
PATHOGENESIS. The microorganisms gain entry into the
lungs by one of the following four routes:
1.
Inhalation of the microbes present in the air.
2.
Aspiration of organisms from the nasopharynx or
oropharynx.
3.
Haematogenous spread from a distant focus of infection.
4.
Direct spread from an adjoining site of infection.
The normal lung is free of bacteria because of the presence
of a number of lung defense mechanisms at different levels
such as nasopharyngeal filtering action, mucociliary action
of the lower respiratory airways, the presence of
phagocytosing alveolar macrophages and immunoglobulins.
Failure of these defense mechanisms and presence of certain
predisposing factors result in pneumonias. These conditions
are as under:
1.
Altered consciousness. The oropharyngeal contents may
be aspirated in states causing unconsciousness e.g. in coma,
cranial trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular accidents, drug
overdose, alcoholism etc.
2.
Depressed cough and glottic reflexes. Depression of
effective cough may allow aspiration of gastric contents e.g.
in old age, pain from trauma or thoracoabdominal surgery,
neuromuscular disease, weakness due to malnutrition,
kyphoscoliosis, severe obstructive pulmonary diseases,
endotracheal intubation and tracheostomy.
3.
Impaired mucociliary transport. The normal protection
offered by mucus-covered ciliated epithelium in the airways
from the larynx to the terminal bronchioles is impaired or
destroyed in many conditions favouring passage of bacteria
into the lung parenchyma. These conditions are cigarette
smoking, viral respiratory infections, immotile cilia
syndrome, inhalation of hot or corrosive gases and old age.
4.
Impaired alveolar macrophage function. Pneumonias
may occur when alveolar macrophage function is impaired
e.g. by cigarette smoke, hypoxia, starvation, anaemia,
pulmonary oedema and viral respiratory infections.
5.
Endobronchial obstruction. The effective clearance
mechanism is interfered in endobronchial obstruction from
tumour, foreign body, cystic fibrosis and chronic bronchitis.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
6.
Leucocyte dysfunctions. Disorders of lymphocytes
including congenital and acquired immunodeficiencies (e.g.
AIDS, immunosuppressive therapy) and granulocyte
abnormalities may predispose to pneumonia.
CLASSIFICATION. On the basis of the anatomic part of the
lung parenchyma involved, pneumonias are traditionally
classified into 3 main types:
1.
Lobar pneumonia
2.
Bronchopneumonia (or Lobular pneumonia)
3.
Interstitial pneumonia.
However, now that much is known about etiology and
pathogenesis of pneumonias, current practice is to follow the
etiologic classification (Table 17.1) which divides pneu-
monias into following 3 main groups:
A. Bacterial pneumonia
B. Viral pneumonia
C. Pneumonias from other etiologies.
In the present discussion, a combined approach of
etiologic and morphologic classification will be followed.
A. BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA
Bacterial infection of the lung parenchyma is the most
common cause of pneumonia or consolidation of one or both
the lungs. Two types of acute bacterial pneumonias are
distinguished—lobar pneumonia and broncho-(lobular-)
pneumonia, each with distinct etiologic agent and
morphologic changes. Another type distinguished by some
workers separately is confluent pneumonia which combines
the features of both lobar and bronchopneumonia and
involves larger (confluent) areas in both the lungs irregularly,
while others consider this as a variant of bronchopneumonia.
Lobar Pneumonia
Lobar pneumonia is an acute bacterial infection of a part of a
lobe, the entire lobe, or even two lobes of one or both the
lungs.
ETIOLOGY. Based on the etiologic microbial agent causing
lobar pneumonia, following types of lobar pneumonia are
described:
1.
Pneumococcal pneumonia. More than 90% of all lobar
pneumonias are caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae,
a lancet-shaped diplococcus. Out of various types,
type 3-S. pneumoniae causes particularly virulent form of lobar
pneumonia. Pneumococcal pneumonia in majority of cases
is community-acquired infection.
2.
Staphylococcal pneumonia. Staphylococcus aureus causes
pneumonia by haematogenous spread of infection from
another focus or after viral infections.
3.
Streptococcal pneumonia. β-haemolytic streptococci may
rarely cause pneumonia such as in children after measles or
influenza, in severely debilitated elderly patients and in
diabetics.
4.
Pneumonia by gram-negative aerobic bacteria. Less
common causes of lobar pneumonia are gram-negative
bacteria like Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae
(Friedlander’s bacillus), Pseudomonas, Proteus and Escherichia
coli, H. influenzae commonly causes pneumonia in children
below 3 years of age after a preceding viral infection.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Laennec’s original
description divides lobar pneumonia into 4 sequential
pathologic phases: stage of congestion (initial phase), red
hepatisation (early consolidation), grey hepatisation (late
consolidation) and resolution. However, these classic stages
seen in untreated cases are found much less often
nowadays due to early institution of antibiotic therapy
and improved medical care.
In lobar pneumonia, as the name suggests, part of a
lobe, a whole lobe, or two lobes are involved, sometimes
bilaterally. The lower lobes are affected most commonly.
The sequence of pathologic changes described below
represents the inflammatory response of lungs in bacterial
infection.
1.
STAGE OF CONGESTION: INITIAL PHASE
(Fig. 17.6,A). The initial phase represents the early acute
inflammatory response to bacterial infection and lasts for
1 to 2 days.
Grossly, the affected lobe is enlarged, heavy, dark red and
congested. Cut surface exudes blood-stained frothy fluid.
Histologically, typical features of acute inflammatory
response to the organisms are seen. These are as under
(Fig. 17.7):
i)
Dilatation and congestion of the capillaries in the
alveolar walls.
ii) Pale eosinophilic oedema fluid in the air spaces.
iii) A few red cells and neutrophils in the intra-alveolar
fluid.
iv) Numerous bacteria demonstrated in the alveolar fluid
by Gram’s staining.
2.
RED HEPATISATION: EARLY CONSOLIDATION
(Fig. 17.6,B). This phase lasts for 2 to 4 days. The term
hepatisation in pneumonia refers to liver-like consistency
of the affected lobe on cut section.
Grossly, the affected lobe is red, firm and consolidated.
The cut surface of the involved lobe is airless, red-pink,
dry, granular and has liver-like consistency. The stage of
red hepatisation is accompanied by serofibrinous pleurisy.
Histologically, the following features are observed
(Fig. 17.8):

i)
The oedema fluid of the preceding stage is replaced
by strands of fibrin.
ii) There is marked cellular exudate of neutrophils and
extravasation of red cells.
iii) Many neutrophils show ingested bacteria.
iv) The alveolar septa are less prominent than in the first
stage due to cellular exudation.
3.
GREY HEPATISATION: LATE CONSOLIDATION
(Fig. 17.6,C). This phase lasts for 4 to 8 days.

stage. For details consult the text.

470
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Grossly, the affected lobe is firm and heavy. The cut
surface is dry, granular and grey in appearance with liver-
like consistency (Fig. 17.9, A). The change in colour from
red to grey begins at the hilum and spreads towards the
periphery. Fibrinous pleurisy is prominent.
Histologically, the following changes are present
(Fig. 17.9,B):
i)
The fibrin strands are dense and more numerous.
ii) The cellular exudate of neutrophils is reduced due to
disintegration of many inflammatory cells as evidenced
by their pyknotic nuclei. The red cells are also fewer. The
macrophages begin to appear in the exudate.
iii) The cellular exudate is often separated from the septal
walls by a thin clear space.
iv) The organisms are less numerous and appear as
degenerated forms.
4.
RESOLUTION (Fig. 17.6,D). This stage begins by 8th
to 9th day if no chemotherapy is administered and is
completed in 1 to 3 weeks. However, antibiotic therapy
induces resolution on about 3rd day. Resolution proceeds
in a progressive manner.
Grossly, the previously solid fibrinous constituent is
liquefied by enzymatic action, eventually restoring the
normal aeration in the affected lobe. The process of
softening begins centrally and spreads to the periphery.
The cut surface is grey-red or dirty brown and frothy,
yellow, creamy fluid can be expressed on pressing. The
pleural reaction may also show resolution but may
undergo organisation leading to fibrous obliteration of
pleural cavity.
Histologically, the following features are noted:
i)
Macrophages are the predominant cells in the alveolar
spaces, while neutrophils diminish in number. Many of
the macrophages contain engulfed neutrophils and debris.
ii) Granular and fragmented strands of fibrin in the
alveolar spaces are seen due to progressive enzymatic
digestion.
iii) Alveolar capillaries are engorged.
iv) There is progressive removal of fluid content as well
as cellular exudate from the air spaces, partly by
expectoration but mainly by lymphatics, resulting in
restoration of normal lung parenchyma with aeration.
COMPLICATIONS. Since the advent of antibiotics, serious
complications of lobar pneumonia are uncommon. However,
they may develop in neglected cases and in patients with
impaired immunologic defenses. These are as under:
1.
Organisation. In about 3% of cases, resolution of the
exudate does not occur but instead it undergoes organisation.
There is ingrowth of fibroblasts from the alveolar septa resul-
ting in fibrosed, tough, airless leathery lung tissue. This type
of post-pneumonic fibrosis is called carnification.
2.
Pleural effusion. About 5% of treated cases of lobar
pneumonia develop inflammation of the pleura with effusion.
The pleural effusion usually resolves but sometimes may
undergo organisation with fibrous adhesions between
visceral and parietal pleura.
3.
Empyema. Less than 1% of treated cases of lobar
pneumonia develop encysted pus in the pleural cavity
termed empyema.
4.
Lung abscess. A rare complication of lobar pneumonia
is formation of lung abscess, especially when there is
secondary infection by other organisms.
5.
Metastatic infection. Occasionally, infection in the lungs
and pleural cavity in lobar pneumonia may extend into the
pericardium and the heart causing purulent pericarditis,
bacterial endocarditis and myocarditis. Other forms of
metastatic infection encountered rarely in lobar pneumonias

are otitis media, mastoiditis, meningitis, brain abscess and
purulent arthritis.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Classically, the onset of lobar
pneumonia is sudden. The major symptoms are: shaking
chills, fever, malaise with pleuritic chest pain, dyspnoea and
cough with expectoration which may be mucoid, purulent
or even bloody. The common physical findings are fever,
tachycardia, and tachypnoea, and sometimes cyanosis if the
patient is severely hypoxaemic. There is generally a marked
neutrophilic leucocytosis. Blood cultures are positive in about
30% of cases. Chest radiograph may reveal consolidation.
Culture of the organisms in the sputum and antibiotic
sensitivity are most significant investigations for institution
of specific antibiotics. The response to antibiotics is usually
rapid with clinical improvement in 48 to 72 hours after the
initiation of antibiotics.
Bronchopneumonia  (Lobular Pneumonia)
Bronchopneumonia or lobular pneumonia is infection of the
terminal bronchioles that extends into the surrounding
alveoli resulting in patchy consolidation of the lung. The
condition is particularly frequent at the extremes of life (i.e.
in infancy and old age), as a terminal event in chronic
debilitating diseases and as a secondary infection following
viral respiratory infections such as influenza, measles etc.
ETIOLOGY. The common organisms responsible for
bronchopneumonia are staphylococci, streptococci,
pneumococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,
and gram-negative bacilli like Pseudomonas and coliform
bacteria.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, bronchopneu-
monia is identified by patchy areas of red or grey
consolidation affecting one or more lobes, frequently
found bilaterally and more often involving the lower zones
of the lungs due to gravitation of the secretions. On cut
surface, these patchy consolidated lesions are dry,
granular, firm, red or grey in colour, 3 to 4 cm in diameter,
slightly elevated over the surface and are often centred
around a bronchiole (Fig. 17.10). These patchy areas are
best picked up by passing the fingertips on the cut surface.
Histologically, the following features are observed
(Fig. 17.11):
i)
Acute bronchiolitis.
ii) Suppurative exudate, consisting chiefly of neutrophils,
in the peribronchiolar alveoli.
iii) Thickening of the alveolar septa by congested
capillaries and leucocytic infiltration.
iv) Less involved alveoli contain oedema fluid.
COMPLICATIONS. The complications of lobar pneumonia
may occur in bronchopneumonia as well. However, complete
resolution of bronchopneumonia is uncommon. There is
generally some degree of destruction of the bronchioles
resulting in foci of bronchiolar fibrosis that may eventually
cause bronchiectasis.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The patients of bronchopneumonia
are generally infants or elderly individuals. There may be
history of preceding bed-ridden illness, chronic debility,
aspiration of gastric contents or upper respiratory infection.
For initial 2 to 3 days, there are features of acute bronchitis
but subsequently signs and symptoms similar to those of
lobar pneumonia appear. Blood examination usually shows
a neutrophilic leucocytosis. Chest radiograph shows mottled,
focal opacities in both the lungs, chiefly in the lower zones.
The salient features of the two main types of bacterial
pneumonias are contrasted in Table 17.2.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
B. VIRAL AND MYCOPLASMAL PNEUMONIA
(PRIMARY ATYPICAL PNEUMONIA)
Viral and mycoplasmal pneumonia is characterised by
patchy inflammatory changes, largely confined to interstitial
tissue of the lungs, without any alveolar exudate. Other terms
used for these respiratory tract infections are interstitial
pneumonitis, reflecting the interstitial location of the
inflammation, and primary atypical pneumonia, atypicality
being the absence of alveolar exudate commonly present in
other pneumonias. Interstitial pneumonitis may occur in all
ages. Most of the cases are mild and transient; exceptionally
it may be severe and fulminant.
ETIOLOGY. Interstitial pneumonitis is caused by a wide
variety of agents, the most common being respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV). Others are Mycoplasma pneumoniae and many
viruses such as influenza and parainfluenza viruses,
adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, coxsackieviruses and cyto-
megaloviruses (CMV). Occasionally, psittacosis (Chlamydia)
and Q fever (Coxiella) are associated with interstitial
pneumonitis.
Infections of the respiratory tract with these organisms
are quite common. In most cases, the infection remains
confined to the upper respiratory tract presenting as common
cold. Occasionally, it may extend lower down to involve the
interstitium of the lungs. The circumstances favouring such

The Respiratory System
extension of infection are malnutrition, chronic debilitating
diseases and alcoholism.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Irrespective of the etio-
logic agent, the pathologic changes are similar in all cases.
Grossly, depending upon the severity of infection, the
involvement may be patchy to massive and widespread
consolidation of one or both the lungs. The lungs are
heavy, congested and subcrepitant. Sectioned surface of
the lung exudes small amount of frothy or bloody fluid.
The pleural reaction is usually infrequent and mild.
Histologically, hallmark of viral pneumonias is the
interstitial nature of the inflammatory reaction. The
microscopic features are as under (Fig. 17.12):
i)
Interstitial inflammation: There is thickening of
alveolar walls due to congestion, oedema and mono-
nuclear inflammatory infiltrate comprised by lympho-
cytes, macrophages and some plasma cells.
ii) Necrotising bronchiolitis: This is characterised by foci
of necrosis of the bronchiolar epithelium, inspissated
secretions in the lumina and mononuclear infiltrate in the
walls and lumina.
iii) Reactive changes: The lining epithelial cells of the
bronchioles and alveoli proliferate in the presence of virus
and may form multinucleate giant cells and syncytia in
the bronchiolar and alveolar walls. Occasionally, viral
inclusions (intranuclear and/or intracytoplasmic) are
found, especially in pneumonitis caused by CMV.
iv) Alveolar changes: In severe cases, the alveolar lumina
may contain oedema fluid, fibrin, scanty inflammatory
exudate and coating of alveolar walls by pink, hyaline
membrane similar to the one seen in respiratory distress
syndrome (page 462). Alveolar changes are prominent if
bacterial infection supervenes.
COMPLICATIONS. The major complication of interstitial
pneumonitis is superimposed bacterial infection and its
complications. Most cases of interstitial pneumonitis recover
completely. In more severe cases, there may be interstitial
fibrosis and permanent damage.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Majority of cases of interstitial
pneumonitis initially have upper respiratory symptoms with
fever, headache and muscle-aches. A few days later appears
dry, hacking, non-productive cough with retrosternal
burning due to tracheitis and bronchitis. Blood film shows

characteristic neutrophilic leucocytosis. Chest radiograph
may show patchy or diffuse consolidation. Cold agglutinin
titres in the serum are elevated in almost half the cases of
mycoplasmal pneumonia, 20% cases of adenovirus infection
but absent in other forms of viral pneumonia. Isolation of
the etiologic agent, otherwise, is difficult.
C. OTHER TYPES OF PNEUMONIAS
Some other types of pneumonias caused by infective agents
(such as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and Legionella
pneumonia) and certain non-infective varieties (e.g. aspiration
pneumonia, hypostatic pneumonia and lipid pneumonia) are
described here.
Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia
Pneumocystis carinii, a protozoon widespread in the
environment, causes pneumonia by inhalation of the
organisms as an opportunistic infection in neonates and
immunosuppressed people. Almost 100% cases of HIV/
AIDS develop opportunistic infection during the course of
disease, most commonly Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
Table 17.3 lists the various etiologic types of pneumonias
associated with HIV infection due to profound immuno-
suppression. Other immunosuppressed groups are patients
on chemotherapy for organ transplant and tumours,
malnutrition, agammaglobulinaemia etc.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the affected parts
of the lung are consolidated, dry and grey.
Microscopically, the features are as under:
i)
Interstitial pneumonitis with thickening and
mononuclear infiltration of the alveolar walls.
ii) Alveolar lumina contain pink frothy fluid containing
the organisms.
iii) By Gomori’s methenamine-silver (GMS) stain, the
characteristic oval or crescentic cysts, about 5 μm in
diameter and surrounded by numerous tiny black dot-
like trophozoites of P. carinii are demonstrable in the frothy
fluid.
iv) No significant inflammatory exudate is seen in the air
spaces.
CLINICAL FEATURES. There is rapid onset of dyspnoea,
tachycardia, cyanosis and non-productive cough. If
untreated, it causes death in one or two weeks. Chest
radiograph shows diffuse alveolar and interstitial infiltrate.
Legionella Pneumonia
Legionella pneumonia or Legionnaire’s disease is an epidemic
illness caused by gram-negative bacilli, Legionella pneumophila
that thrives in aquatic environment. It was first recognised
following investigation into high mortality among those
attending American Legion Convention in Philadelphia in
July 1976. The epidemic occurs in summer months by spread
of organisms through contaminated drinking water or in air-
conditioning cooling towers. Impaired host defenses in the
form of immunodeficiency, corticosteroid therapy, old age
and cigarette smoking play important roles.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, there are chan-
ges of widespread bronchopneumonia involving many
lobes and there may be consolidation of the entire lung.
Pleural effusion is frequently present.
Histologically, the changes are not distinctive. Common
features are as under:
i)
Intra-alveolar exudate, initially of neutrophils but later
composed mainly of macrophages.
ii) Alveolar septa show foci of hyperplasia of the lining
epithelium and thrombosis of vessels in the septa.
iii) The organisms may be demonstrated in the macro-
phages by special stains or by immunofluorescent
techniques.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The disease begins with malaise,
headache and muscle-aches followed by high fever, chills,
cough and tachypnoea. Systemic manifestations unrelated
to pathologic changes in the lungs are seen due to
bacteraemia and include abdominal pain, watery diarrhoea,
proteinuria and mild hepatic dysfunction.
Aspiration (Inhalation) Pneumonia
Aspiration or inhalation pneumonia results from inhalation
of different agents into the lungs. These substances include
food, gastric contents, foreign body and infected material
from oral cavity. A number of factors predispose to inhalation
pneumonia which include: unconsciousness, drunkenness,
neurological disorders affecting swallowing, drowning,
necrotic oropharyngeal tumours, in premature infants and
congenital tracheo-oesophageal fistula. Some patients die
immediately from asphyxiation or laryngospasm without
developing pneumonia.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Pathologic changes vary
depending upon the particulate matter aspirated but in
general right lung is affected more often due to direct path
from the main bronchus:
1.
Aspiration of small amount of sterile foreign matter
such as acidic gastric contents produce chemical
pneumonitis. It is characterised by haemorrhagic
pulmonary oedema with presence of particles in the
bronchioles. Patients rapidly develop cyanosis, dyspnoea,
shock and bloody sputum and are often likely to die of
cardiac failure. If the patient survives the acute episode,
secondary bacterial infection is likely to occur.

The Respiratory System
2.
Non-sterile aspirate causes widespread broncho-
pneumonia with multiple areas of necrosis and suppu-
ration. A granulomatous reaction with foreign body giant
cells may surround the aspirated vegetable matter.
Hypostatic Pneumonia
Hypostatic pneumonia is the term used for collection of
oedema fluid and secretions in the dependent parts of the
lungs in severely debilitated, bed-ridden patients. The
accumulated fluid in the basal zone and posterior part of
lungs gets infected by bacteria from the upper respiratory
tract and sets in bacterial pneumonia. Hypostatic pneumonia
is a common terminal event in the old, feeble, comatose
patients.
Lipid Pneumonia
Another variety of non-infective pneumonia is lipid
pneumonia which is of 2 types: exogenous and endogenous.
1.
Exogenous lipid pneumonia. This is caused by aspiration
of a variety of oily materials. These are: inhalation of oily
nasal drops, regurgitation of oily medicines from stomach
(e.g. liquid paraffin), administration of oily vitamin
preparation to reluctant children or to debilitated old
patients.
2.
Endogenous lipid pneumonia. Endogenous origin of
lipids causing pneumonic consolidation is more common.
The sources of origin are tissue breakdown following
obstruction to airways e.g. obstruction by bronchogenic
cancer, tuberculosis and bronchiectasis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the exogenous
lipid pneumonia affects the right lung more frequently
due to direct path from the main bronchus. Quite often,
the lesions are bilateral. The affected part of the lungs is
consolidated. Cut surface is characteristically ‘golden
yellow’.
Microscopically, the features are as under:
i)
Lipid is finely dispersed in the cytoplasm of
macrophages forming foamy macrophages within the
alveolar spaces.
ii) There may be formation of cholesterol clefts due to
liberation of cholesterol and other lipids.
iii) Formation of granulomas with foreign body giant cells
may be seen around the large lipid droplets.
LUNG ABSCESS
Lung abscess is a localised area of necrosis of lung tissue
with suppuration. It is of 2 types (Fig. 17.13):
Primary lung abscess that develops in an otherwise normal
lung. The commonest cause is aspiration of infected material.
Secondary lung abscess that develops as a complication of
some other disease of the lung or from another site.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The microorganisms commonly
isolated from the lungs in lung abscess are streptococci,
staphylococci and various gram-negative organisms. These
are introduced into the lungs from one of the following
mechanisms:
1.
Aspiration of infected foreign material. A number of
foreign materials such as food, decaying teeth, gastric
contents, severely infected gingivae and teeth, and necrotic
tissue from lesions in the mouth, upper respiratory tract or
nasopharynx may be aspirated. This occurs particularly in
favourable circumstances such as during sleep,
unconsciousness, anaesthesia, general debility and acute
alcoholism.
2.
Preceding bacterial infection. Preceding broncho-
pneumonia in a debilitated patient may develop into lung
abscess. Other infective conditions like tuberculosis,
bronchiectasis and mycotic infections may occasionally result
in formation of lung abscess.
3.
Bronchial obstruction. An abscess may form distal to an
obstructed bronchus such as from bronchial tumour or from
impacted foreign body.
4.
Septic embolism. Infected emboli originating from
pyaemia, thrombophlebitis or from vegetative bacterial
endocarditis may be disseminated in the venous circulation
and reach the right side of the heart from where they are
lodged in the lung and result in multiple abscesses.
5.
Miscellaneous. Rarely lung abscesses may occur from
following causes:
i)
Infection in pulmonary infarcts.
ii) Amoebic abscesses due to infection with Entamoeba
histolytica.
iii) Trauma to the lungs.
iv) Direct extension from a suppurative focus in the
mediastinum, oesophagus, subphrenic area or spine.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Abscesses due to aspira-
tion are more likely to be in right lung due to more vertical
main bronchus and are frequently single. They are
commonly located in the lower part of the right upper
lobe or apex of right lower lobe. Abscesses developing

abscess—mostly single, large, commonly due to aspiration, located most

476
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
from preceding pneumonia and septic or pyaemic
abscesses are often multiple and scattered throughout the
lung.
Grossly, abscesses may be of variable size from a few
millimeters to large cavities, 5 to 6 cm in diameter. The
cavity often contains exudate. An acute lung abscess is
initially surrounded by acute pneumonia and has poorly-
defined ragged wall. With passage of time, the abscess
becomes chronic and develops fibrous wall (Fig. 17.14,A).
Histologically, the characteristic feature is the destruction
of lung parenchyma with suppurative exudate in the lung
cavity. The cavity is initially surrounded by acute
inflammation in the wall but later there is replacement by
chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate composed of
lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages. In more
chronic cases, there is considerable fibroblastic
proliferation forming a fibrocollagenic wall (Fig. 17.14,B).
CLINICAL FEATURES. The clinical manifestations are
fever, malaise, loss of weight, cough, purulent expectoration
and haemoptysis in half the cases. Clubbing of the fingers
and toes appears in about 20% of patients. Secondary
amyloidosis may occur in chronic long-standing cases.
FUNGAL INFECTIONS OF LUNG
Fungal infections of the lung are more common than
tuberculosis in the US. These infections in healthy individuals
are rarely serious but in immunosuppressed individuals may
prove fatal. General aspects of mycotic infections are covered
in Chapter 7. Here, some common examples of fungal
infections of the lung are briefly given:
1.
Aspergillosis. Aspergillosis is the most common fungal
infection of the lung caused by Aspergillus fumigatus that
grows best in cool, wet climate. The infection may result in
allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, aspergilloma and
necrotising bronchitis. Immunocompromised persons develop
more serious manifestations of aspergillus infection,
especially in leukaemic patients on cytotoxic drug therapy
and HIV/AIDS. Extensive haematogenous spread of
aspergillus infection may result in widespread changes in
lung tissue due to arterial occlusion, thrombosis and
infarction.
Grossly, pulmonary aspergillosis may occur within
preexisting pulmonary cavities or in bronchiectasis as fungal
ball.
Microscopically, the fungus may appear as a tangled mass
within the cavity. The organisms are identified by their
characteristic morphology— thin septate hyphae with
dichotomous branching at acute angles which stain positive
for fungal stains such as PAS and silver impregnation
technique (Fig. 17.15). The wall of the cavity shows chronic
inflammatory cells.
2.
Mucormycosis. Mucormycosis or phycomycosis is
caused by Mucor and Rhizopus. The infection in the lung
occurs in a similar way as in aspergillosis. The pulmonary
lesions are especially common in patients of diabetic
ketoacidosis. Mucor is distinguished by its broad, non-parallel,
nonseptate hyphae which branch at an obtuse angle.
Mucormycosis is more often angioinvasive, and
disseminates; hence it is more destructive than aspergillosis.
3.
Candidiasis. Candidiasis or moniliasis caused by Candida
albicans is a normal commensal in oral cavity, gut and vagina
but attains pathologic form in immunocompromised host.
Angioinvasive growth of the organism may occur in the
airways.
4. Histoplasmosis. It is caused by oval organism, Histoplasma
capsulatum, by inhalation of infected dust or bird droppings.
The condition may remain asymptomatic or may produce
lesions similar to the Ghon’s complex.
Figure 17.14

abscess formed by necrosed alveoli and dense acute and chronic inflammatory cells.

477
CHAPTER 17
The Respiratory System
5.
Cryptococcosis. It is caused by Cryptococcus neoformans
which is round yeast having a halo around it due to shrinkage
in tissue sections. The infection occurs from infection by
inhalation of pigeon droppings. The lesions in the body may
range from a small parenchymal granuloma in the lung to
cryptococcal meningitis.
6.
Coccidioidomycosis. Coccidioidomycosis is caused by
Coccidioides immitis which are spherical spores. The infection
in human beings is acquired by close contact with infected
dogs. The lesions consist of peripheral parenchymal
granuloma in the lung.
7.
Blastomycosis. It is an uncommon condition caused by
Blastomyces dermatitidis. The lesions result from inhalation
of spores in the ground. Pathological features may present
as Ghon’s complex-like lesion, as a pneumonic consolidation,
and as multiple skin nodules.
PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS
The classical and most common example of chronic infection
of the lungs is pulmonary tuberculosis. Pulmonary lesions
caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other mycobacteria
have already been discussed along with general aspects of
tuberculosis and other granulomatous inflammations in
Chapter 6.
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or chronic
obstructive airway disease (COAD) are commonly used
clinical terms for a group of pathological conditions in which
there is chronic, partial or complete, obstruction to the airflow
at any level from trachea to the smallest airways resulting in
functional disability of the lungs i.e. they are diffuse lung
diseases. The following 4 entities are included in COPD:
I.
Chronic bronchitis
II. Emphysema
III. Bronchial asthma
IV. Bronchiectasis
Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are quite common
and often occur together. Now, small airways disease
involving inflammation of small bronchi and bronchioles
(bronchiolitis) has also been added to the group of COPD.
CHRONIC BRONCHITIS
Chronic bronchitis is a common condition defined clinically
as persistent cough with expectoration on most days for at
least three months of the year for two or more consecutive
years. The cough is caused by oversecretion of mucus. In
spite of its name, chronic inflammation of the bronchi is not
a prominent feature. The condition is more common in
middle-aged males than females; approximately 20% of adult
men and 5% of adult women have chronic bronchitis, but
only a minority of them develop serious disabling COPD or
cor pulmonale. Quite frequently, chronic bronchitis is
associated with emphysema.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The two most important etiologic
factors responsible for majority of cases of chronic bronchitis
are: cigarette smoking and atmospheric pollution. Other
contributory factors are occupation, infection, familial and
genetic factors.
1.
Smoking. The most commonly identified factor
implicated in causation of chronic bronchitis and in
emphysema is heavy smoking. Heavy cigarette smokers have
4 to 10 times higher proneness to develop chronic bronchitis.
Prolonged cigarette smoking appears to act on the lungs in a
number of ways:
i)
It impairs ciliary movement.
ii) It inhibits the function of alveolar macrophages.
iii) It leads to hypertrophy and hyperplasia of mucus-
secreting glands.

for fungi, Gomory’s methenamine silver (GMS).

478
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
iv) It causes considerable obstruction of small airways.
v) It stimulates the vagus and causes bronchoconstriction.
2.
Atmospheric pollution. The incidence of chronic
bronchitis is higher in industrialised urban areas where air
is polluted. Some of the atmospheric pollutants which
increase the risk of developing chronic bronchitis are sulfur
dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate dust and toxic fumes.
3.
Occupation. Workers engaged in certain occupations
such as in cotton mills (byssinosis), plastic factories etc. are
exposed to various organic or inorganic dusts which
contribute to disabling chronic bronchitis in such individuals.
4.
Infection. Bacterial, viral and mycoplasmal infections do
not initiate chronic bronchitis but usually occur secondary
to bronchitis. Cigarette smoke, however, predisposes to
infection responsible for acute exacerbation in chronic
bronchitis.
5.
Familial and genetic factors. There appears to be a
poorly-defined familial tendency and genetic predisposition
to develop disabling chronic bronchitis. However, it is more
likely that nonsmoker family members who remain in the
air-pollution of home are significantly exposed to smoke
(passive smoking) and hence have increased blood levels of
carbon monoxide.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the bronchial
wall is thickened, hyperaemic and oedematous. Lumina
of the bronchi and bronchioles may contain mucus plugs
and purulent exudate.
Microscopically, just as there is clinical definition, there
is histologic definition of chronic bronchitis by increased
Reid index. Reid index is the ratio between thickness of
the submucosal mucus glands (i.e. hypertrophy and
hyperplasia) in the cartilage-containing large airways to
that of the total bronchial wall (Fig. 17.16). The increase
in thickness can be quantitatively assessed by micrometer
lens. The bronchial epithelium may show squamous
metaplasia and dysplasia. There is little chronic
inflammatory cell infiltrate. The non-cartilage containing
small airways show goblet cell hyperplasia and intra-
luminal and peribronchial fibrosis.
CLINICAL FEATURES. There is considerable overlap of
clinical features of chronic bronchitis and pulmonary
emphysema (discussed below) as quite often the two coexist.
The contrasting features of ‘predominant emphysema’ and
‘predominant bronchitis’ are presented in Table 17.5. Some
important features of ‘predominant bronchitis’ are as under:
1.
Persistent cough with copious expectoration of long
duration; initially beginning in a heavy smoker with ‘morning
catarrh’ or ‘throat clearing’ which worsens in winter.
2.
Recurrent respiratory infections are common.
3.
Dyspnoea is generally not prominent at rest but is more
on exertion.
4.
Patients are called ‘blue bloaters’ due to cyanosis and
oedema.
5.
Features of right heart failure (cor pulmonale) are
common.
6.
Chest X-ray shows enlarged heart with prominent
vessels.
EMPHYSEMA
The WHO has defined pulmonary emphysema as
combination of permanent dilatation of air spaces distal to
the terminal bronchioles and the destruction of the walls of
dilated air spaces. Thus, emphysema is defined morphologically,
while chronic bronchitis is defined clinically. Since the two
conditions coexist frequently and show considerable overlap
in their clinical features, it is usual to label patients as
‘predominant emphysema’ and ‘predominant bronchitis’.
CLASSIFICATION. As mentioned in the beginning of this
chapter, a lobule is composed of about 5 acini distal to a
terminal bronchiole and that an acinus consists of 3 to 5
generations of respiratory bronchioles and a variable number
of alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs (page 461). As per WHO
definition of pulmonary emphysema, it is classified according
to the portion of the acinus involved, into 5 types: centri-
acinar, panacinar (panlobular), para-septal (distal acinar),
irregular (para-cicatricial) and mixed (unclassified)
emphysema. A number of other conditions to which the term
‘emphysema’ is loosely applied are, in fact, examples of
‘overinflation’. A classification based on these principles is
outlined in Table 17.4.

CHAPTER 17
The Respiratory System
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The commonest form of COPD is
the combination of chronic bronchitis and pulmonary
emphysema. Chronic bronchitis, however, does not always
lead to emphysema nor all cases of emphysema have changes
of chronic bronchitis. The association of the two conditions
is principally linked to the common etiologic factors— most
importantly tobacco smoke and air pollutants. Other less
significant contributory factors are occupational exposure,
infection and somewhat poorly-understood familial and
genetic influences. All these factors have already been
discussed above.
However, pathogenesis of the most significant event in
emphysema, the destruction of the alveolar walls, is not linked
to bronchial changes but is closely related to deficiency of
serum alpha-1-antitrypsin (α1-protease inhibitor) commonly
termed protease-antiprotease hypothesis detailed below.
Protease-antiprotease hypothesis. Alpha-1-antitrypsin (α-
1-AT), also called α1-protease inhibitor (α-1-Pi), is a
glycoprotein that forms the normal constituent of the α1-
globulin fraction of the plasma proteins on serum
electrophoresis. The single gene locus that codes for α-1-AT
is located on the long arm of chromosome 15. It is normally
synthesised in the liver and is distributed in the circulating
blood, tissue fluids and macrophages. The normal function
of α1-AT is to inhibit proteases and hence its name α1-
protease inhibitor. The proteases (mainly elastases) are
derived from neutrophils. Neutrophil elastase has the
capability of digesting lung parenchyma but is inhibited from
doing so by anti-elastase effect of α1-AT.
 There are several known alleles of α1-AT which have an
autosomal codominant inheritance pattern and are classified
as normal  (PiMM), deficient (PiZZ), null type (Pi null null)
having no detectable level, and dysfunctional (PiSS) type
having about half the normal level.
The most common abnormal phenotype in classic α1-AT
deficiency is homozygous state PiZZ resulting from a single
amino acid substitution Glu→Lys which causes spontaneous
polymerisation of α1-AT and inhibits its release  from the
liver. The remaining material of α1-AT in the liver causes
hepatic cirrhosis (Chapter 22).
Clinically significant deficiency is also associated with
homozygous Pi null null and heterozygous Pi nullZ.
The heterozygote pattern of PiMZ has intermediate levels
which is not sufficient to produce clinical deficiency, but
heterozygote individuals who smoke heavily have higher
risk of developing emphysema.
The α1-AT deficiency develops in adults and causes
pulmonary emphysema in smokers as well as in non-
smokers, though the smokers become symptomatic about
15 years earlier than non-smokers. The other organ showing
effects of α1-AT deficiency is the liver which may develop
obstructive jaundice early in infancy, and cirrhosis and
hepatoma late in adulthood (Chapter 22).
The mechanism of alveolar wall destruction in
emphysema by elastolytic action is based on the imbalance
between proteases (chiefly elastase) and anti-proteases (chiefly
anti-elastase):
By decreased anti-elastase activity i.e. deficiency of α-1
antitrypsin.
By increased activity of elastase i.e. increased neutrophilic
infiltration in the lungs causing excessive elaboration of
neutrophil elastase.
There are enough evidences to suggest that smoking
promotes emphysema by both decreasing the amount of anti-
elastase as well as by increasing the elastolytic protease in
the lungs. These are as under:
1.
Oxidant in cigarette smoke has inhibitory influence on
α-1-antitrypsin, thus lowering the level of anti-elastase
activity.

Systemic Pathology
2.
Smokers have up to ten times more phagocytes and
neutrophils in their lungs than nonsmokers; thus they have
very high elastase activity.
Pathogenesis of emphysema by protease-antiprotease
mechanism is diagrammatically illustrated in Fig. 17.17.
PATHOLOGIC FEATURES. Emphysema can be
diagnosed with certainty only by gross and histologic
examination of sections of whole lung. The lungs should
be perfused with formalin under pressure in inflated state
to grade the severity of emphysema with naked eye.
Grossly, the lungs are voluminous, pale with little blood.
The edges of the lungs are rounded. Mild cases show
dilatation of air spaces visible with hand lens. Advanced
cases show subpleural bullae and blebs bulging outwards
from the surface of the lungs with rib markings between
them. The bullae are air-filled cyst-like or bubble-like
structures, larger than 1 cm in diameter (Fig. 17.18). They
are formed by the rupture of adjacent air spaces while
blebs are the result of rupture of alveoli directly into the
subpleural interstitial tissue and are the common cause
of spontaneous pneumothorax.
Microscopically, depending upon the type of emphysema,
there is dilatation of air spaces and destruction of septal
walls of part of acinus involved i.e. respiratory bron-
chioles, alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs. Changes of
bronchitis may be present. Bullae and blebs when present
show fibrosis and chronic inflammation of the walls.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Cases of ‘predominant emphysema’
develop clinical features after about one-third of the
pulmonary parenchyma is damaged which occurs most
severely in panacinar emphysema. The age at the time of
diagnosis is often a decade later (about 60 years) than the
age for predominant bronchitis (about 50 years). Though
there is considerable overlap between the clinical features of
chronic bronchitis and emphysema, the following features
generally characterise ‘predominant emphysema’
(Table 17.5):
1.
There is long history of slowly increasing severe
exertional dyspnoea.
2.
Patient is quite distressed with obvious use of accessory
muscles of respiration.

After these general comments about morphologic and
clinical features of emphysema, the specific pathologic
changes in individual types of ‘emphysema’ and
‘overinflation’ as classified in Table 17.4 are described below.
Morphology of Individual Types of Emphysema
1.
CENTRIACINAR (CENTRILOBULAR) EMPHYSEMA.
Centriacinar or centrilobular emphysema is one of the
common types. It is characterised by initial involvement of
respiratory bronchioles i.e. the central or proximal part of
the acinus (Fig. 17.19,B). This is the type of emphysema that
usually coexists with chronic bronchitis and occurs
predominantly in smokers and in coal miners’ pneumo-
coniosis (page 488).
Grossly, the lesions are more common and more severe
in the upper lobes of the lungs. The characteristic
appearance is obvious in cut surface of the lung. It shows
distended air spaces in the centre of the lobules
surrounded by a rim of normal lung parenchyma in the
same lobule. The lobules are separated from each other
by fine fibrous tissue septa. Large amount of black
pigment is often present in the walls of emphysematous
spaces. In more severe cases, distal parts of acini are also
involved and the appearance may closely resemble
panacinar emphysema.
Microscopically, there is distension and destruction of the
respiratory bronchiole in the centre of lobules, surroun-
ded peripherally by normal uninvolved alveoli. The
terminal bronchioles supplying the acini show chronic
inflammation and are narrowed.
2.
PANACINAR (PANLOBULAR) EMPHYSEMA.
Panacinar or panlobular emphysema is the other common
type. In this type, all portions of the acinus are affected but
not of the entire lung (Fig. 17.19,C). Panacinar emphysema
is most often associated with α1-antitrypsin deficiency in
middle-aged smokers and is the one that produces the most
characteristic anatomical changes in the lung in emphysema.
Grossly, in contrast to centriacinar emphysema, the
panacinar emphysema involves lower zone of lungs more
frequently and more severely than the upper zone. The
involvement may be confined to a few lobules, or may be
more widespread affecting a lobe or part of a lobe of the
lung. The lungs are enlarged and overinflated.
Figure 17.19
The anatomic regions of involvement in an acinus in major forms of emphysema.

482
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Microscopically, usually all the alveoli within a lobule
are affected to the same degree. All portions of acini are
distended—respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and
alveoli, are all dilated and their walls stretched and thin.
Ruptured alveolar walls and spurs of broken septa are
seen between the adjacent alveoli. The capillaries are
stretched and thinned. Special stains show loss of elastic
tissue. Inflammatory changes are usually absent
(Fig. 17.20).
3.
PARASEPTAL (DISTAL ACINAR) EMPHYSEMA. This
type of emphysema involves distal part of acinus while the
proximal part is normal. Paraseptal or distal acinar
emphysema is localised along the pleura and along the
perilobular septa. The involvement is seen adjacent to the
areas of fibrosis and atelectasis and involves upper part of
lungs more severely than the lower. This form of emphysema
is seldom associated with COPD but is the common cause of
spontaneous pneumothorax in young adults. Grossly, the
subpleural portion of the lung shows air-filled cysts, 0.5 to
2 cm in diameter.
4.
IRREGULAR (PARA-CICATRICIAL) EMPHYSEMA.
This is the most common form of emphysema, seen
surrounding scars from any cause. The involvement is
irregular as regards the portion of acinus involved as well as
within the lung as a whole. During life, irregular emphysema
is often asymptomatic and may be only an incidental autopsy
finding.
5.
MIXED (UNCLASSIFIED) EMPHYSEMA. Quite often,
the same lung may show more than one type of emphysema.
It is usually due to more severe involvement resulting in loss
of clearcut distinction between one type of emphysema and
the other. Thus, the lungs of an elderly smoker at autopsy
may show continuation of centriacinar emphysema in the
upper lobes, panacinar in the lower lobes, and paraseptal
emphysema in the subpleural region.
Morphology of Types of Overinflation
Under this heading are covered a group of lung conditions
of heterogeneous etiology characterised by overinflation of
the parts of acini but without significant destruction of the
walls and are sometimes loosely termed emphysema.
1.
COMPENSATORY OVERINFLATION (COMPEN-
SATORY EMPHYSEMA). When part of a lung or a lobe of
lung is surgically removed, the residual lung parenchyma
undergoes compensatory hyperinflation so as to fill the
pleural cavity. Histologic examination shows dilatation of
alveoli but no destruction of septal walls and hence the term
compensatory overinflation is preferable over ‘compensatory
emphysema’.
2.
SENILE HYPERINFLATION (AGING LUNG, SENILE
EMPHYSEMA). In old people, the lungs become voluminous
due to loss of elastic tissue, thinning and atrophy of the
alveolar ducts and alveoli. The alveoli are thin-walled and
distended throughout the lungs but there is no significant
destruction of the septal walls and, therefore, preferable
designation is ‘senile hyperinflation’ over ‘senile
emphysema.’
3.
OBSTRUCTIVE OVERINFLATION (INFANTILE
LOBAR EMPHYSEMA). Partial obstruction to the bronchial
tree such as by a tumour or a foreign body causes
overinflation of the region supplied by obstructed bronchus.
Infantile lobar emphysema is a variant of obstructive
overinflation occurring in infants in the first few days of life
who develop respiratory distress or who have congenital
hypoplasia of bronchial cartilage. In all such cases, air enters
the lungs during inspiration but cannot leave on expiration
resulting in ballooning up of the affected part of the lung.
4.
UNILATERAL TRANSLUCENT LUNG (UNILATE-
RAL EMPHYSEMA). This is a form of overinflation in which
one lung or one of its lobes or segments of a lobe are
radiolucent. The condition occurs in adults and there is
generally a history of serious pulmonary infection in
childhood, probably bronchiolitis obliterans. The affected

483
CHAPTER 17
The Respiratory System
lung is grossly overinflated. Microscopy shows overinflated
alveoli and there is histologic evidence of preceding
widespread bronchiolitis obliterans.
5.
INTERSTITIAL EMPHYSEMA (SURGICAL EMPHY-
SEMA). The entry of air into the connective tissue framework
of the lung is called interstitial or surgical emphysema. The
usual sources of entry of air into stroma of the lung are
rupture of alveoli or of larger airways. The causes are as
under:
i)
Violent coughing with bronchiolar obstruction e.g. in
children with whooping cough, bronchitis, in patients with
obstruction to the airways by foreign bodies, blood clots and
exposure to irritant gases.
ii) Rupture of the oesophagus, trauma to the lung, or major
bronchus and trachea.
iii) Entry of air through surgical incision.
iv) Fractured rib puncturing the lung parenchyma.
v) Sudden change in atmospheric pressure e.g. in
decompression sickness.
The condition may affect patients of all ages. On rupture
of alveoli, the leaked air enters the fibrous connective tissue
of the alveolar walls from where it extends into the fibrous
septa of the lung, into the mediastinum, the pleura, and even
the subcutaneous tissues. Escape of air into the pleural cavity
may cause pneumothorax. Collection of small quantities of
air is generally harmless and is resorbed. However, extensive
accumulation of air in surgical emphysema may produce
impaired blood flow in the lungs. Pneumo-mediastinum may
produce symptoms resembling myocardial infarction.
Histologically, the alveoli are distended but septal walls
are not damaged; therefore it is not true emphysema.
There are clear spaces of leaked out air in connective tissue
septa.
BRONCHIAL ASTHMA
Asthma is a disease of airways that is characterised by
increased responsiveness of the tracheobronchial tree to a
variety of stimuli resulting in widespread spasmodic
narrowing of the air passages which may be relieved
spontaneously or by therapy. Asthma is an episodic disease
manifested clinically by paroxysms of dyspnoea, cough and
wheezing. However, a severe and unremitting form of the
disease termed status asthmaticus may prove fatal.
Bronchial asthma is common and prevalent worldwide;
in the United States about 4% of population is reported to
suffer from this disease. It occurs at all ages but nearly 50%
of cases develop it before the age of 10 years. In adults, both
sexes are affected equally but in children there is 2:1 male-
female ratio.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS AND TYPES. Based on the stimuli
initiating bronchial asthma, two broad etiologic types are
traditionally described: extrinsic (allergic, atopic) and intrinsic
(idiosyncratic, non-atopic) asthma. A third type is a mixed pattern
in which the features do not fit clearly into either of the two
main types. The contrasting features of the two main types
are summed up in Table 17.6.
1.
Extrinsic (atopic, allergic) asthma. This is the most
common type of asthma. It usually begins in childhood or in
early adult life. Most patients of this type of asthma have
personal and/or family history of preceding allergic diseases
such as rhinitis, urticaria or infantile eczema. Hyper-
sensitivity to various extrinsic antigenic substances or
‘allergens’ is usually present in these cases. Most of these
allergens cause ill-effects by inhalation e.g. house dust,
pollens, animal danders, moulds etc. Occupational asthma
stimulated by fumes, gases and organic and chemical dusts
is a variant of extrinsic asthma. There are increased levels of
IgE in the serum and positive skin test with the specific
offending inhaled antigen representing an IgE-mediated type
I hypersensitivity reaction which includes an ‘acute
immediate response’ and a ‘late phase reaction’:
Acute immediate response is initiated by IgE-sensitised mast
cells (tissue counterparts of circulating basophils) on the
mucosal surface. Mast cells on degranulation release
mediators like histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins,
platelet activating factor and chemotactic factors for
eosinophils and neutrophils. The net effects of these
mediators are bronchoconstriction, oedema, mucus
hypersecretion and accumulation of eosinophils and
neutrophils.
Late phase reaction follows the acute immediate response
and is responsible for the prolonged manifestations of
asthma. It is caused by excessive mobilisation of blood
leucocytes that include basophils besides eosinophils and

neutrophils. These result in further release of mediators
which accentuate the above-mentioned effects. In addition,
inflammatory injury is caused by neutrophils and by major
basic protein (MBP) of eosinophils.
2.
Intrinsic (idiosyncratic, non-atopic) asthma. This type
of asthma develops later in adult life with negative personal
or family history of allergy, negative skin test and normal
serum levels of IgE. Most of these patients develop typical
symptom-complex after an upper respiratory tract infection
by viruses. Associated nasal polypi and chronic bronchitis
are commonly present. There are no recognisable allergens
but about 10% of patients become hypersensitive to drugs,
most notably to small doses of aspirin (aspirin-sensitive
asthma).
3.
Mixed type. Many patients do not clearly fit into either
of the above two categories and have mixed features of both.
Those patients who develop asthma in early life have strong
allergic component, while those who develop the disease late
tend to be non-allergic. Either type of asthma can be
precipitated by cold, exercise and emotional stress.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The pathologic changes
are similar in both major types of asthma. The pathologic
material examined is generally autopsy of lungs in
patients dying of status asthmaticus but the changes are
expected to be similar in non-fatal cases.
Grossly, the lungs are overdistended due to over-inflation.
The cut surface shows characteristic occlusion of the
bronchi and bronchioles by viscid mucus plugs.
Microscopically, the following changes are observed
(Fig. 17.21):
1.
The mucus plugs contain normal or degenerated
respiratory epithelium forming twisted strips called
Curschmann’s spirals.
2.
The sputum usually contains numerous eosinophils
and diamond-shaped crystals derived from eosinophils
called Charcot-Leyden crystals.
3.
The bronchial wall shows thickened basement
membrane of the bronchial epithelium, submucosal
oedema and inflammatory infiltrate consisting of
lymphocytes and plasma cells with prominence of eosino-
phils. There is hypertrophy of submucosal glands as well
as of the bronchial smooth muscle.
4.
Changes of bronchitis and emphysema may super-
vene, especially in intrinsic asthma.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Asthmatic patients suffer from
episodes of acute exacerbations interspersed with symptom-
free periods. Characteristic clinical features are paroxysms
of dyspnoea, cough and wheezing. Most attacks typically
last for a few minutes to hours. When attacks occur
continuously it may result in more serious condition called
status asthmaticus. The clinical diagnosis is supported by
demonstration of circulation eosinophilia and sputum
demonstration of Curschmann’s spirals and Charcot-Leyden
crystals. More chronic cases may develop cor pulmonale.
BRONCHIECTASIS
Bronchiectasis is defined as abnormal and irreversible
dilatation of the bronchi and bronchioles (greater than 2 mm
in diameter) developing secondary to inflammatory
weakening of the bronchial walls. The most characteristic
clinical manifestation of bronchiectasis is persistent cough
with expectoration of copious amounts of foul-smelling,
purulent sputum. Post-infectious cases commonly develop
in childhood and in early adult life.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The origin of inflammatory destruc-
tive process of bronchial walls is nearly always a result of
two basic mechanisms: endobronchial obstruction and
infection.
Endobronchial obstruction by foreign body, neoplastic
growth or enlarged lymph nodes causes resorption of air
distal to the obstruction with consequent atelectasis and
retention of secretions.
Infection may be secondary to local obstruction and
impaired systemic defense mechanism promoting bacterial
growth, or infection may be a primary event i.e.
bronchiectasis developing in suppurative necrotising
pneumonia.
These 2 mechanisms—endobronchial obstruction and
infection, are seen in a number of clinical settings as under:
1.
Hereditary and congenital factors. Several hereditary
and congenital factors may result secondarily in diffuse
bronchiectasis:
i)
Congenital bronchiectasis caused by developmental defect
of the bronchial system.
ii) Cystic fibrosis, a generalised defect of exocrine gland
secretions, results in obstruction, infection and bronchiectasis
(Chapter 22).
iii) Hereditary immune deficiency diseases are often associated
with high incidence of bronchiectasis.
iv) Immotile cilia syndrome that includes Kartagener’s
syndrome (bronchiectasis, situs inversus and sinusitis) is
characterised by ultrastructural changes in the microtubules
causing immotility of cilia of the respiratory tract epithelium,
sperms and other cells. Males in this syndrome are often
infertile (Chapter 23).

Charcot-Leyden crystals found in mucus plugs in patients with bronchial
asthma.

485
CHAPTER 17
The Respiratory System
v) Atopic bronchial asthma patients have often positive family
history of allergic diseases and may rarely develop diffuse
bronchiectasis.
2.
Obstruction. Post-obstructive bronchiectasis, unlike the
congenital-hereditary forms, is of the localised variety,
usually confined to one part of the bronchial system. The
causes of endobronchial obstruction include foreign bodies,
endobronchial tumours, compression by enlarged hilar
lymph nodes and post-inflammatory scarring (e.g. in healed
tuberculosis) all of which favour the development of post-
obstructive bronchiectasis.
3.
As secondary complication. Necrotising pneumonias such
as in staphylococcal suppurative pneumonia and tuberculosis
may develop bronchiectasis as a complication.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The disease charac-
teristically affects distal bronchi and bronchioles beyond
the segmental bronchi.
Grossly, the lungs may be involved diffusely or
segmentally. Bilateral involvement of lower lobes occurs
most frequently. More vertical air passages of left lower
lobe are more often involved than the right. The pleura is
usually fibrotic and thickened with adhesions to the chest
wall.  The dilated airways, depending upon their gross or
bronchographic appearance, have been subclassified into
the following different types (Fig. 17.22):
i)
Cylindrical: the most common type characterised by
tube-like bronchial dilatation.
ii) Fusiform: having spindle-shaped bronchial dilatation.
iii) Saccular: having rounded sac-like bronchial distension.
iv) Varicose: having irregular bronchial enlargements.
Cut surface of the affected lobes, generally the lower
zones, shows characteristic honey-combed appearance. The
bronchi are extensively dilated nearly to the pleura, their
walls are thickened and the lumina are filled with mucus or
muco-pus. The intervening lung parenchyma is reduced and
fibrotic (Fig. 17.23).
Microscopically, fully-developed cases show the
following histologic features (Fig. 17.24):
i)
The bronchial epithelium may be normal, ulcerated
or may show squamous metaplasia.
ii) The bronchial wall shows infiltration by acute and
chronic inflammatory cells and destruction of normal
muscle and elastic tissue with replacement by fibrosis.
iii) The intervening lung parenchyma shows fibrosis,
while the surrounding lung tissue shows changes of
interstitial pneumonia.
iv) The pleura in the affected area is adherent and shows
bands of fibrous tissue between the bronchus and the
pleura.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
CLINICAL FEATURES. The clinical manifestations of
bronchiectasis typically consist of chronic cough with foul-
smelling sputum production, haemoptysis and recurrent
pneumonia. Sinusitis is a common accompaniment of diffuse
bronchiectasis. Late complications occurring in cases
uncontrolled for years include development of clubbing of
the fingers, metastatic abscesses (often to the brain),
amyloidosis and cor pulmonale.
CHRONIC RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE
The second large group of diffuse lung disease is ‘chronic
restrictive pulmonary disease’ characterised by reduced
expansion of lung parenchyma with decreased total lung
capacity. This group of diseases must be distinguished from
the foregoing COPD (Table 17.7).
Restrictive lung disease includes 2 types of conditions:
A. Restriction due to chest wall disorder: It includes
following conditions:
1.
Kyphoscoliosis
2.
Poliomyelitis
3.
Severe obesity
4.
Pleural diseases.
As a group, these conditions cause restriction to
expansion of lungs due to alterations in chest wall, pleura
and neuromuscular apparatus, but are primarily not lung
parenchymal diseases.
B. Restriction due to interstitial and infiltrative diseases.
Commonly called as ‘interstitial lung diseases (ILDs)’, these
are diseases characterised by non-infectious diffuse
parenchymal involvement of the lung i.e. the alveolar lumina
and alveolar epithelium, capillary basement membrane, the
intervening space, perivascular tissue and lymphatic tissue.
Diffuse lung parenchymal involvement may be primary, or
it may be involved secondarily as a part of some other multi-
organ disease process. The term ‘infiltrative’ is used here to
denote the radiologic appearance of lungs in chest
radiographs which show characteristic diffuse interstitial
ground-glass opacities. The ILDs consist of more than 200
heterogeneous conditions which have common clinical,
radiologic, and functional manifestations but diverse
pathological features. As a group, ILDs have high mortality

and morbidity.  Depending upon the underlying pathologic
findings, ILDs have been broadly classified into 2 groups,
each further subdivided into those with known and unknown
causes:
Conditions with predominant non-specific inflammation
(alveolitis, interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis).
Conditions with predominant granulomatous inflam-
mation.
Based on this, an abbreviated classification of ILDs is
given in Table 17.8.
The exact pathogenesis of ILDs from injury to fibrosis is
not known. However, it can be explained on immune basis
as under (Fig. 17.25):
i) There is local inflammatory reaction in the alveoli in response
to various exogenous and endogenous stimuli in the form of
lymphocytes (both B and T) and macrophages.
ii) Activated macrophages cause recruitment of neutrophils
and also produce fibrogenic and chemotactic cytokines.
Neutrophils liberate proteases and oxidants which injure the
type I pneumocytes resulting in initial microscopic alveolitis,
while cytokines cause subsequent proliferation of type II
pneumocytes and fibrosis.
iii) The result is inflammatory destruction of the pulmonary
parenchyma followed by fibrosis. Eventually, there is
widespread destruction of alveolar capillary walls resulting
in end-stage lung or ‘honeycomb lung’.
The major common clinical manifestations of restrictive
lung diseases are exertional dyspnoea, non-persistent
productive cough, tachypnoea, cyanosis and sometimes
haemoptysis but no wheezing so characteristic of COPD.
Important and common examples of ILDs are discussed
below.
PNEUMOCONIOSES
Pneumoconiosis is the term used for lung diseases caused
by inhalation of dust, mostly at work (pneumo = lung; conis =
dust in Greek). These diseases are, therefore, also called ‘dust
diseases’ or ‘occupational lung diseases’.
The type of lung disease varies according to the nature
of inhaled dust. Some dusts are inert and cause no reaction
and no damage at all, while others cause immunologic
damage and predispose to tuberculosis or to neoplasia. The
factors which determine the extent of damage caused by
inhaled dusts are as under:
1.
size and shape of the particles;
2.
their solubility and physicochemical composition;
3.
the amount of dust retained in the lungs;
4.
the additional effect of other irritants such as tobacco
smoke; and
5.
host factors such as efficiency of clearance mechanism
and immune status of the host.
In general, most of the inhaled dust particles larger than
5 μm reach the terminal airways where they are ingested by

Systemic Pathology
alveolar macrophages. Most of these too are eliminated by
expectoration but the remaining accumulate in alveolar
tissue. Of particular interest are the particles smaller than
1 μm which are deposited in the alveoli most efficiently. Most
of the dust-laden macrophages accumulated in the alveoli
die leaving the dust, around which fibrous tissue is formed.
Some macrophages enter the lymphatics and reach regional
lymph nodes. The tissue response to inhaled dust may be
one of the following three types:
Fibrous nodules e.g. in coal-workers’ pneumoconiosis and
silicosis.
Interstitial fibrosis e.g. in asbestosis.
Hypersensitivity reaction e.g. in berylliosis.
A comprehensive list of various types of occupational
lung diseases caused by inorganic (mineral) dusts and orga-
nic dusts is presented in Table 17.9. The more common
examples of pneumoconioses are described here.
Coal-Workers’ Pneumoconiosis
This is the commonest form of pneumoconiosis and is defined
as the lung disease resulting from inhalation of coal dust
particles, especially in coal-miners engaged in handling soft
bituminous coal for a number of years, often 20 to 30 years.
It exists in 2 forms—a milder form of the disease called simple
coal workers’ pneumoconiosis and an advanced form termed
progressive massive fibrosis (complicated coal-miners’
pneumoconiosis). Anthracosis, on the other hand, is not a lung
disease in true sense but is the common, benign and
asymptomatic accumulation of carbon dust in the lungs of
most urban dwellers due to atmospheric pollution and
cigarette smoke (anthacite refers to coal). Anthracotic pigment
is deposited in the macrophages in the alveoli and around
the respiratory bronchioles and into the draining lymph
nodes but does not produce any respiratory difficulty or
radiologic changes.
PATHOGENESIS. Pathogenetically, it appears that
anthracosis, simple coal-workers’ pneumoconiosis and
progressive massive fibrosis are different stages in the evolu-
tion of fully-developed coal-workers’ pneumoconiosis.
However, progressive massive fibrosis develops in a small
proportion of cases (2-8%) of simple coal-workers’ pneumo-
coniosis. A number of predisposing factors have been
implicated in this transformation as follows:
1.
Older age of the miners.
2.
Severity of coal dust burden engulfed by macrophages.
3.
Prolonged exposure (20 to 30 years) to coal dust.
4.
Concomitant tuberculosis.
5.
Additional role of silica dust.
Activation of alveolar macrophage plays the most
significant role in the pathogenesis of progressive massive
fibrosis by release of various mediators (Fig. 17.26,A):
i)
Free radicals which are reactive oxygen species which
damage the lung parenchyma.
ii) Chemotactic factors for various leucocytes (leukotrienes,
TNF, IL-8 and IL-6) resulting in infiltration into pulmonary
tissues by these inflammatory cells which on activation cause
further damage.
iii) Fibrogenic cytokines such as IL-1, TNF and platelet derived
growth factor (PDGF) which stimulate healing by fibrosis
due to proliferation of fibroblasts at the damaged tissue site.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. In life, the pathologic
changes in lung in coal-workers’ pneumoconiosis are
graded by radiologic appearance according to the size and
extent of opacities. The pathologic findings at autopsy of
lungs in the major forms of coal-workers’ pneumoconiosis
are considered below under 3 headings: simple coal-
workers’ pneumoconiosis, progressive massive fibrosis
and rheumatoid pneumoconiosis (Caplan’s syndrome).
SIMPLE COAL-WORKERS’ PNEUMOCONIOSIS.
Grossly, the lung parenchyma shows small, black focal
lesions, measuring less than 5 mm in diameter and evenly
distributed throughout the lung but have a tendency to
be more numerous in the upper lobes. These are termed
coal macules, and if palpable are called nodules. The air
spaces around coal macules are dilated with little
destruction of alveolar walls (Fig. 17.26,A). Though some
workers have called it centrilobular emphysema of coal-
miners (page 481), others prefer not to consider it
emphysema because there is no significant destruction of
alveolar walls. Similar blackish pigmentations are found
on the pleural surface and in the regional lymph nodes
(Fig. 17.27).
Histologically, the following features are seen (Fig. 17.28):
1.
Coal macules are composed of aggregates of dust-
laden macrophages. These are present in the alveoli and
in the bronchiolar and alveolar walls.

The Respiratory System
2.
There is some increase in the network of reticulin and
collagen in the coal macules.
3.
Respiratory bronchioles and alveoli surrounding the
macules are distended without significant destruction of
the alveolar walls.
PROGRESSIVE MASSIVE FIBROSIS. Grossly, besides
the coal macules and nodules of simple pneumoconiosis,
there are larger, hard, black scattered areas measuring
more than 2 cm in diameter and sometimes massive. They
are usually bilateral and located more often in the upper
parts of the lungs posteriorly. Sometimes, these masses
break down centrally due to ischaemic necrosis or due to
tuberculosis forming cavities filled with black semifluid
resembling India ink. The pleura and the regional lymph
nodes are also blackened and fibrotic (Fig. 17.27).
Histologically, the following features are present:
1.
The fibrous lesions are composed almost entirely of
dense collagen and carbon pigment.
2.
The wall of respiratory bronchioles and pulmonary
vessels included in the massive scars are thickened and
their lumina obliterated.
Figure 17.26
Pathogenesis of three common forms of pneumoconiosis. A, Coal-workers’  pneumoconiosis. The macrophages phagocytose
large amount of coal dust particles which are then passed into the interstitial tissue of the lung and aggregate around respiratory bronchiole and
cause focal dust emphysema. B, Silicosis. The tiny silica particles are toxic to macrophages. The dead macrophages release fibrogenic factor and
eventually result in silicotic nodule. C, Asbestosis. Asbestos fibres initiate lot of interstitial fibrosis and also form asbestos bodies.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
3.
There is scanty inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes
and plasma cells around the areas of massive scars.
4.
The alveoli surrounding the scars are markedly
dilated.
Progressive massive fibrosis probably has immuno-
logical pathogenetic basis as described above.
RHEUMATOID PNEUMOCONIOSIS (CAPLAN’S
SYNDROME). The development of rheumatoid arthritis
in a few cases of coal-workers’ pneumoconiosis, silicosis
or asbestosis is termed rheumatoid pneumoconiosis or
Caplan’s syndrome.
Grossly, the lungs have rounded, firm nodules with
central necrosis, cavitation or calcification.
Histologically, the lung lesions are modified rheumatoid
nodules with central zone of dust-laden fibrinoid necrosis
enclosed by palisading fibroblasts and mononuclear cells.
The lung lesions in Caplan’s syndrome have immuno-
logical basis for their origin as evidenced by detection of
rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies.
CLINICAL FEATURES.  Simple coal-workers’ pneumo-
coniosis is the mild form of disease characterised by chronic
cough with black expectoration. The radiological findings of
nodularities in the lungs appear after working for several
years in coal-mines. Progressive massive fibrosis is, however,
a serious disabling condition manifested by progressive
dyspnoea and chronic cough with jet-black sputum.
Recurrent bacterial infections may produce purulent sputum.
More advanced cases develop pulmonary hypertension and
right ventricular hypertrophy (cor pulmonale). The radio-
logical appearance may suggest tuberculosis or cancer.
Tuberculosis and rheumatoid arthritis are more common in
coal miners than the general population. Coal workers have
increased risk of developing carcinomas of the stomach,
probably due to swallowing of coal dust containing
carcinogens. But bronchogenic carcinoma does not appear
to be more common in coal-miners than in other groups.
Silicosis
Historically, silicosis used to be called ‘knife grinders’ lung.
Silicosis is caused by prolonged inhalation of silicon dioxide,
commonly called silica. Silica constitutes about one-fourth
of earth’s crust. Therefore, a number of occupations engaged
in silceous rocks or sand and products manufactured from
them are at increased risk. These include miners (e.g. of
granite, sandstone, slate, coal, gold, tin and copper), quarry
workers, tunnellers, sandblasters, grinders, ceramic workers,
foundry workers and those involved in the manufacture of
abrasives containing silica. Peculiar to India are the occu-
pational exposure to pencil, slate and agate-grinding industry
carrying high risk of silicosis (agate = very hard stone
containing silica). According to an Indian Council of Medical
Research report, it is estimated that about 3 million workers
in India are at high potential risk of silica exposure employed
in a variety of occupations including construction workers.
An infrequent acute form of silicosis called accelerated silicosis
produces irregular fibrosis adjoining the alveoli which is
filled with lipoproteinaceous exudate and resembles alveolar
proteinosis (page 494). However, if not specified, silicosis
refers to the common chronic form of the disease characterised
by formation of small collagenous silicotic nodules.
PATHOGENESIS. Silicosis appears after prolonged
exposure to silica dust, often a few decades. Besides, it
depends upon a number of other factors such as total dose,
duration of exposure, the type of silica inhaled and individual
host factors. The mechanisms involved in the formation of
silicotic nodules are not clearly understood. The following
sequence of events has been proposed and schematically
illustrated in Fig. 17.26, B:
1.
Silica particles between 0.5 to 5 μm size on reaching the
alveoli are taken by the macrophages which undergo
necrosis. New macrophages engulf the debris and thus a
repetitive cycle of phagocytosis and necrosis is set up.
2.
Some silica-laden macrophages are carried to the respi-
ratory bronchioles, alveoli and in the interstitial tissue. Some
of the silica dust is transported to the subpleural and
interlobar lymphatics and into the regional lymph nodes. The
cellular aggregates containing silica become associated with
lymphocytes, plasma cells, mast cells and fibroblasts.
3.
Silica dust is fibrogenic. Crystalline form, particularly
quartz, is more fibrogenic than non-crystalline form of silica.
4.
Simultaneously, there is activation of T and B lymphocytes.
This results in increased serum levels of immunoglobulins
(IgG and IgM), antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor and
circulating immune complexes as well as proliferation of T
cells.
5.
As noted above, silica is cytotoxic and kills the macro-
phages which engulf it. The released silica dust activates
viable macrophages leading to secretion of macrophage-
derived growth factors such as interleukin-1 that favour
fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis.
Figure 17.28

pneumoconiosis. Coal macules composed of aggregates of dust-laden
macrophages and collagens are seen surrounding respiratory
bronchioles. The alveoli and respiratory bronchioles surrounding the coal

491
CHAPTER 17
The Respiratory System
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the chronic silico-
tic lung is studded with well-circumscribed, hard, fibrotic
nodules, 1 to 5 mm in diameters. They are scattered
throughout the lung parenchyma but are initially more
often located in the upper zones of the lungs. These
nodular lesions frequently have simultaneous deposition
of coal-dust and may develop calcification. The pleura is
grossly thickened and adherent to the chest wall. There
may be similar fibrotic nodules on the pleura and within
the regional lymph nodes. The nodular lesions are
detectable as egg-shell shadows in chest X-rays. The
lesions may undergo ischaemic necrosis and develop
cavitation, or be complicated by tuberculosis and
rheumatoid pneumoconiosis (Fig. 17.29).
Histologically, the following features are observed
(Fig. 17.30):
1.
The silicotic nodules are located in the region of
respiratory bronchioles, adjacent alveoli, pulmonary
arteries, in the pleura and the regional lymph nodes.
2.
The silicotic nodules consist of central hyalinised
material with scanty cellularity and some amount of dust.
The hyalinised centre is surrounded by concentric
laminations of collagen which is further enclosed by more
cellular connective tissue, dust-filled macrophages and a
few lymphocytes and plasma cells. Some of these nodules
may have calcium deposits.
3.
The collagenous nodules have cleft-like spaces
between the lamellae of collagen which when examined
polariscopically may demonstrate numerous birefringent
particles of silica.
4.
The severe and progressive form of the disease may
result in coalescence of adjacent nodules and cause
complicated silicosis similar to progressive massive
fibrosis of coal-workers’ pneumoconiosis (described
above).
5.
The intervening lung parenchyma may show
hyperinflation or emphysema.
6.
Cavitation when present may be due to ischaemic
necrosis in the nodules, or may reveal changes of tuber-
culosis or rheumatoid pneumoconiosis (Caplan’s
syndrome), discussed already.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The functional effects of silicosis
develop slowly and insidiously. The main presenting
complaint is dyspnoea. In time, the patient may develop
features of obstructive or restrictive pattern of disease. Other
complications such as pulmonary tuberculosis, rheumatoid
arthritis (Caplan’s syndrome) and cor pulmonale may occur.
The chest radiograph initially shows fine nodularity, while
later there are larger and coalescent nodules. Silicosis does
not carry increased risk of developing bronchogenic
carcinoma.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Asbestos Disease
Asbestos as a mineral is known to mankind for more than
4000 years but its harmful effects have come to light during
the last few decades. Asbestos is a Greek word meaning
‘unquenchable’. In general, if coal is lot of dust and little fibrosis,
asbestos is little dust and a lot of fibrosis. Prolonged exposure
for a number of years to asbestos dust produces three types
of severe diseases: asbestosis of lungs, pleural disease and
tumours. In nature, asbestos exists as long thin fibrils which
are fire-resistant and can be spun into yarns and fabrics
suitable for thermal and electrical insulation and has many
applications in industries. Particularly at risk are workers
engaged in mining, fabrication and manufacture of a number
of products from asbestos such as asbestos pipes, tiles, roofs,
textiles, insulating boards, sewer and water conduits, brake
lining, clutch castings etc.
There are two major geometric forms of asbestos:
Serpentine consisting of curly and flexible fibres. It
includes the most common chemical form chrysotile (white
asbestos) comprising more than 90% of commercially used
asbestos.
Amphibole consists of straight, stiff and rigid fibres. It
includes the less common chemical forms crocidolite (blue
asbestos), amosite (brown asbestos), tremolite, anthophyllite and
actinolyte. However, the group of amphibole, though less
common, is more important since it is associated with
induction of malignant pleural tumours, particularly in
association with crocidolite.
However, in view of long term harmful effects of asbestos
exposure, it has been mostly replaced with synthetic mineral
fibres such as fiberglass in developed countries since 1975
but it continues to be used in developing countries of the
world.
PATHOGENESIS. Overexposure to asbestos for more than
a decade may produce asbestosis of the lung, pleural lesions
and certain tumours. How asbestos causes all these lesions
is not clearly understood but the following mechanisms have
been suggested (Fig. 17.26,C):
1.
The inhaled asbestos fibres are phagocytosed by alveolar
macrophages from where they reach the interstitium. Some of
the engulfed dust is transported via lymphatics to the pleura
and regional lymph nodes.
2.
The asbestos-laden macrophages release chemo-attractants
for neutrophils and for more macrophages, thus inciting
cellular reaction around them.
3.
Asbestos fibres are coated with glycoprotein and
endogenous haemosiderin to produce characteristic beaded
or dumbbell-shaped asbestos bodies.
4.
All types of asbestos are fibrogenic and result in interstitial
fibrosis. Fibroblastic proliferation may occur via macrophage-
derived growth factor such as interleukin-1. Alternatively,
fibrosis may occur as a reparative response to tissue injury
by lysosomal enzymes released from macrophages and
neutrophils or by toxic free radicals.
5.
A few immunological abnormalities such as antinuclear
antibodies and rheumatoid factor have been found in cases
of asbestosis but their role in the genesis of disease is not
clear.
6.
Asbestos fibres are carcinogenic, the most carcinogenic
being crocidolite. There is high incidence of bronchogenic
carcinoma in asbestosis which is explained on the basis of
the role of asbestos fibres as tumour promoters or by causing
cell death of the airways so that it is exposed to the
carcinogenic effect of cigarette smoke. The development of
pleural mesothelioma in these cases is probably by carrying
of asbestos fibres via lymphatics to the pleura.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. As stated already, over-
exposure to asbestos is associated with 3 types of lesions:
asbestosis, pleural disease and certain tumours.
A. ASBESTOSIS. The gross pulmonary fibrosis caused
by asbestos exposure and histologic demonstration of
asbestos bodies on asbestos fibres is termed asbestosis.
Grossly, the affected lungs are small and firm with
cartilage-like thickening of the pleura. The sectioned
surface shows variable degree of pulmonary fibrosis,
especially in the subpleural areas and in the bases of lungs
(Fig. 17.31). The advanced cases may show cystic changes.
Histologically, the following changes are observed:
1.
There is non-specific interstitial fibrosis.
2.
There is presence of characteristic asbestos bodies in the
involved areas (Fig. 17.32). These are asbestos fibres coated
with glycoprotein and haemosiderin and appear beaded
or dumbbell-shaped. The coating stains positively for
Prussian blue reaction.

matic appearance.

CHAPTER 17
The Respiratory System
3.
There may be changes of emphysema in the
pulmonary parenchyma between the areas of interstitial
fibrosis.
4.
The involvement of hilar lymph nodes in asbestosis is
not as significant as in silicosis.
B. PLEURAL DISEASE. Pleural disease in asbestos
exposure may produce one of the following 3 types of
lesions:
1.
Pleural effusion. It develops in about 5% of asbestos
workers and is usually serious type. Pleural effusion is
generally accompanied by subpleural asbestosis.
2.
Visceral pleural fibrosis. Quite often, asbestosis is
associated with dense fibrous thickening of the visceral
pleura encasing the lung.
3.
Pleural plaques. Fibrocalcific pleural plaques are the
most common lesions associated with asbestos exposure.
Grossly, the lesions appear as circumscribed, flat, small
(upto 1 cm in diameter), firm or hard, bilateral nodules.
They are seen more often on the posterolateral part of
parietal pleura and on the pleural surface of the
diaphragm.
Microscopically, they consist of hyalinised collagenous
tissue which may be calcified so that they are visible on
chest X-ray. Asbestos bodies are generally not found
within the plaques.
C. TUMOURS. Asbestos exposure predisposes to a
number of cancers, most importantly bronchogenic
carcinoma (page 496) and malignant mesothelioma (page
505). A few others are: carcinomas of oesophagus,
stomach, colon, kidneys and larynx and various lymphoid
malignancies.
1.
Bronchogenic carcinoma is the most common
malignancy in asbestos workers. Its incidence is 5 times
higher in non-smoker asbestos workers than the non-
smoker general population and 10 times higher in smoker
asbestos workers than the other smokers.
2.
Malignant mesothelioma is an uncommon tumour
but association with asbestos exposure is present in 30 to
80% of cases with mesothelioma. The exposure need not
be heavy because mesothelioma is known to develop in
people living near asbestos plants or in wives of asbestos
workers.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Asbestosis is a slow and insidious
illness. The patient may remain asymptomatic for a number
of years in spite of radiological evidence of calcific pleural
plaques and parenchymatous changes. However, onset of
interstitial fibrosis brings about dyspnoea with dry or
productive cough. More advanced cases show development
of Caplan’s syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, cor
pulmonale and various forms of cancers.
Berylliosis
Berylliosis is caused by heavy exposure to dust or fumes of
metallic beryllium or its salts. Beryllium was used in the past
in fluorescent tubes and light bulbs but currently it is
principally used in nuclear and aerospace industries and in
the manufacture of electrical and electronic equipments. Two
forms of pulmonary berylliosis are recognised—acute  and
chronic.
ACUTE BERYLLIOSIS. Acute berylliosis occurs in
individuals who are unusually sensitive to it and are heavily
exposed to it for 2 to 4 weeks. The pulmonary reaction is in
the form of an exudative chemical pneumonitis in which the
alveoli are filled with protein-rich fluid with formation of
hyaline membrane. The patient develops sudden dyspnoea,
hyperapnoea and substernal pain. Most patients recover
completely.
CHRONIC BERYLLIOSIS. Chronic berylliosis develops in
individuals who are sensitised to it for a number of years,
often after a delay of 20 or more years. The disease is a cell-
mediated hypersensitivity reaction in which the metal
beryllium acts as a hapten. The condition is characterised by
development of non-caseating epithelioid granulomas like
those of sarcoidosis. These granulomas are diffusely scattered
throughout the lung parenchyma. The granulomas have
giant cells which frequently contain 3 types of inclusions:
1.
Birefringent crystals.
2.
Concentrically-laminated haematoxyphilic Schaumann or
conchoid bodies.
3.
Acidophilic stellate-shaped asteroid bodies.
These inclusions are described in giant cells of
granulomas in sarcoidosis too (Chapter 6). Similar sarcoid-
like granulomas can occur in other organs such as in the liver,
kidneys, spleen or lymph nodes in chronic berylliosis.
ILD ASSOCIATED WITH IMMUNOLOGIC LUNG DISEASES
Hypersensitivity (Allergic) Pneumonitis
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is a group of immunologically-
mediated ILDs occurring in workers inhaling a variety of
organic (biologic) antigenic materials. The condition may
have an acute onset due to isolated exposure or may be chronic
due to repeated low-dose exposure.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. A list of important organic
(biologic) dusts which may be inhaled to produce hyper-
sensitivity pneumonitis is already given in Table 17.9. The
immunologic mechanisms underlying hypersensitivity
pneumonitis from any of these causes appear to be either
type III immune-complex disease or type IV delayed-
hypersensitivity reaction.
1.
Farmers’ lung is the classic example resulting from
exposure to thermophilic actinomycetes generated by humid
and warm mouldy hay.
2.
Bagassosis occurs in individuals engaged in manufacture
of paper and cardboard from sugarcane bagasse. Spores of
thermophilic actinomycetes grow rapidly in mouldy
sugarcane bagasse which are inhaled.
3.
Byssinosis is an occupational lung disease occurring in
workers exposed to fibres of cotton, flex and hemp for a
number of years. The role of immunologic mechanisms in
byssinosis is not as clear as in exposure to other organic dusts.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
4.
Bird-breeders’ (Bird-fanciers’) lung occurs in pigeon
breeders, parrot breeders, chicken farmers and bird-fanciers
who are exposed to bird-droppings and danders from their
feathers.
5.
Mushroom-workers’ lung is found in mushroom
cultivators exposed to mushroom compost dust.
6.
Malt-workers’ lung is seen in distillery and brewery
workers who are exposed to mouldy barley and malt dust.
7.
Maple-bark disease occurs in those involved in stripping
of maple bark and inhale mouldy maple bark (maple tree is
grown in northern hemisphere for timber and its leaf is the
national emblem of Canada).
8.
Silo-fillers’ disease occurs in individuals who enter the
silo (silo is an airtight store-house of fodder for farm animals)
in which toxic fumes of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide are
formed due to fermentation of silage. The condition is
generally rapidly fatal; less often it may lead to ILD.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The pathologic changes
primarily involve the alveoli in contrast to bronchiolar
involvement in asthma. The changes vary depending upon
whether the biopsy is examined in early stage or in late
stage.
In early stage, the alveolar walls are diffusely infiltrated
with lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages. A
proportion of cases show granulomas consisting of
histiocytes and giant cells of foreign body or Langhans’
type.
In chronic cases, the lungs show interstitial fibrosis with
some inflammatory infiltrate. Honeycombing of the lung
may be present.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The clinical features vary according
to the stage. In acute cases, there is generally sudden attack
of fever, myalgia, dyspnoea, cough and leucocytosis. In more
chronic cases, there are signs of slowly progressive
respiratory failure, dyspnoea and cyanosis as seen in other
interstitial lung diseases.
Pulmonary Infiltrates with Eosinophilia
Pulmonary eosinophilia, eosinophilic pneumonias or
pulmonary infiltration with eosinophilia (PIE) syndrome are
a group of immunologically-mediated lung diseases
characterised by combination of 2 features:
Infiltration of the lungs in chest radiographs.
Elevated eosinophil count in the peripheral blood.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. PIE syndrome has a number of
diverse causes and pathogenesis. These are as under:
1.
Löeffler’s syndrome is characterised by eosinophilia in
the blood and typical wandering radiologic shadows,
appearing in some part of the lung for a few days, and then
disappearing to appear again somewhere else in the lung.
The condition is generally self-limiting and mild, associated
with slight fever and a few respiratory symptoms. The
etiology is unknown.
2.
Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia is caused by the
passage of larvae of worms through the lungs e.g. in filariasis,
ascariasis, strongyloidosis, toxocariasis and ancylostomiasis.
3.
Secondary chronic pulmonary eosinophilia occurs
secondary to adverse drug reactions; infection with fungi,
bacteria, and helminths; allergic bronchopulmonary
aspergillosis and in association with asthma.
4.
Idiopathic chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is
characterised by prominent focal areas of consolidation of
the lung. The condition is clinically diagnosed by excluding
other known causes of pulmonary eosinophilia.
5.
Hypereosinophilic syndrome is occurrence of eosino-
philia of over 1500/μl for more than 6 months without any
identifiable cause and without eosinophilic infiltrates in the
lungs and other organs.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The lesions in the lungs
are similar in all cases of hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
Grossly, the lungs usually show patchy consolidation.
Microscopically, there is thickening of the alveolar walls
by oedema and exudate, chiefly of eosinophils, and some
lymphocytes and plasma cells. The alveolar lumina also
contain eosinophils. Occasionally, small granulomas may
be present.
Goodpasture’s Syndrome
Goodpasture’s syndrome or pulmonary haemorrhage
syndrome is combination of necrotising haemorrhagic
interstitial pneumonitis and rapidly progressive
glomerulonephritis. The renal lesions of Goodpasture’s
syndrome are described in Chapter 22.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The condition results from
immunologic damage produced by anti-basement membrane
antibodies formed against antigens common to the
glomerular and pulmonary basement membranes. The
trigger for initiation of this autoimmune response is not clear;
it could be virus infection, exposure to hydrocarbons and
smoking.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the lungs are
heavy with red-brown areas of consolidation.
Microscopically, the features vary according to the stage
of the disease:
In acute stage, there are focal areas of haemorrhages in
the alveoli and focal necrosis in the alveolar walls.
In more chronic cases, there is organisation of the
haemorrhage leading to interstitial fibrosis and filling of
alveoli with haemosiderin-laden macrophages.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The condition occurs commonly in
2nd or 3rd decades of life with preponderance in males. The
pulmonary manifestations generally precede the renal
disease. Most cases present with haemoptysis accompanied
with dyspnoea, fatigue, weakness and anaemia. Renal
manifestations soon appear which include haematuria,
proteinuria, uraemia and progressive renal failure.
Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis
Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a rare chronic disease in
which the distal airspaces of the lungs are filled with
granular, PAS-positive, eosinophilic material with abundant

495
CHAPTER 17
The Respiratory System
lipid in it. The condition can occur at any age from infancy
to old age.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The etiology and pathogenesis of
alveolar proteinosis are unknown. A number of possibilities
have been suggested:
Since the alveolar material is combination of lipid and
protein, it is not simply an overproduction of surfactant.
Alveolar proteinosis may have an occupational etiology
as seen in patients heavily exposed to silica.
It may have an etiologic association with haematologic
malignancies.
There may be defective alveolar clearance of debris.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, usually both
lungs are involved, particularly the lower lobes. The lungs
are heavier with areas of consolidation. Sectioned surface
exudes abundant turbid fluid.
Histologically, the hallmark of the condition is presence
of homogeneous, granular, eosinophilic material which
stains brightly with PAS. Often, the material contains
cholesterol clefts. There is no significant inflammatory
infiltrate in the affected alveoli. Biochemically, the material
consists of serum proteins of low molecular weight,
cholesterol and phospholipids similar to surfactant.
Electron microscopy reveals that the material consists of
necrotic alveolar macrophages and desquamated alveolar
epithelial cells.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The condition is manifested
clinically by dyspnoea, cough, chest pain, pyrexia, fatigue
and loss of weight. Chest X-ray shows confluent areas of
consolidation. Occasionally, alveolar proteinosis may recover
spontaneously but more often it is a fatal condition.
ILD ASSOCIATED WITH
CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASES
A number of connective tissue diseases or collagen diseases
may result in chronic interstitial fibrosis and destruction of
blood vessels. These diseases are described in detail in
Chapter 4 but the lung involvement in important forms of
collagen diseases is briefly considered here.
1.
SCLERODERMA (PROGRESSIVE SYSTEMIC
SCLEROSIS). The lungs are involved in 80% cases of
scleroderma. Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis is the most
common form of pulmonary involvement. The disease
usually involves the lower lobes and subpleural regions of
the lungs and may lead to honeycombing of the lung. There
is increased risk of development of cancer of the lung in
pulmonary fibrosis in scleroderma.
2.
RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. Pulmonary involvement
in rheumatoid arthritis may result in pleural effusion,
interstitial pneumonitis, necrobiotic nodules and rheumatoid
pneumoconiosis (Caplan’s syndrome, page 490). The
parenchymatous lesions in rheumatoid arthritis are most
commonly seen in the lower lobe. Necrobiotic nodules are
the most specific manifestations of rheumatoid disease and
closely resemble the subcutaneous nodules commonly found
in rheumatoid arthritis.
3.
SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS. Patients with
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) commonly develop
some form of lung disease during the course. The most
common manifestation of SLE is pleurisy with small amount
of pleural effusion that may contain LE cells. Other
pulmonary lesions in SLE are interstitial pneumonitis,
pulmonary haemorrhage and vasculitis.
4.
SJÖGREN’S SYNDROME. Patients with Sjögren’s
syndrome often have rheumatoid arthritis and associated
pulmonary changes. Involvement of the bronchial mucous
gland by a process similar to that in the salivary glands can
lead to inadequate bronchial clearance and repeated
infections.
5.
DERMATOMYOSITIS AND POLYMYOSITIS.
Interstitial pneumonitis and interstitial fibrosis commonly
accompany dermatomyositis and polymyositis.
6.
WEGENER’S GRANULOMATOSIS. Wegener’s
granulomatosis is an necro-inflammatory lesion having
4 components—granulomas of the upper respiratory tract,
granulomas of the lungs, systemic vasculitis (page 403) and
focal necrotising glomerulonephritis. Localised or limited form
of the disease occurs in the lungs without involvement of
other organs. Pulmonary involvement is in the form of single
or multiple granulomas.
Microscopically, these granulomas have foci of fibrinoid
necrosis and intense infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells
and macrophages with scattered multinucleate giant cells.
Besides necrotising granulomas, there is associated
vasculitis.
IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is the most common form of
diffuse interstitial pneumonia and has bad prognosis
compared with other forms of lung fibrosis. Diffuse inter-
stitial fibrosis can occur as a result of a number of pathologic
entities such as pneumoconiosis, hypersensitivity
pneumonitis and collagen-vascular disease. However, in half
the cases of diffuse interstitial fibrosis, no apparent cause or
underlying disease is identifiable. Such cases are included
under the entity ‘idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis’ in the United
States and ‘cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis’ in Britain.
PATHOGENESIS. The pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmo-
nary fibrosis is unknown and the condition is diagnosed by
excluding all known causes of interstitial fibrosis. However,
a few evidences point toward immunologic mechanism:
1.
High levels of autoantibodies such as rheumatoid factor
and antinuclear antibodies.
2.
Elevated titres of circulating immune complexes.
3.
Immunofluorescent demonstration of the deposits of
immunoglobulins and complement on the alveolar walls in
biopsy specimens.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The lung involvement in
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is often bilateral and
widespread.

496
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Grossly, the lungs are firm, heavier with reduced volume.
Honeycombing (i.e. enlarged, thick-walled air spaces)
develops in parts of lung, particularly in the subpleural
region.
Histologically, the changes vary according to the stage
of the disease.
In early stage, there is widening of the alveolar septa
by oedema and cellular infiltrate by mononuclear
inflammatory cells. The alveolar lining cells may show
hyperplasia at places and are flattened at other places.
There is often formation of hyaline membranes. The
alveolar spaces contain exudate consisting of
macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils. Many of the
macrophages contain lamellar bodies derived from
surfactant of the necrotic alveolar lining epithelial cells.
Based on the observation of desquamative component in
the cellular exudate, some authors label the early stage of
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as ‘desquamative interstitial
pneumonitis’.
In advanced stage, there is organisation of the alveolar
exudate and replacement fibrosis in the alveoli as well as
in the interstitial septal wall with variable amount of
inflammation. Eventually, there are small cystic areas
(honeycomb lung) with alternating areas of fibrosis
containing thick-walled and narrowed vessels. This stage
is often referred to as ‘chronic interstitial pneumonitis’ or
‘usual interstitial pneumonitis’.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Middle-aged males are affected
more frequently. The usual features are of respiratory
difficulty beginning with dry cough and slowly progressing
dyspnoea. More advanced cases may develop clubbing of
fingers and cor pulmonale. A rapidly progressive form of
the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with death within 6 weeks
to 6 months is termed Hamman-Rich syndrome.
ILD ASSOCIATED WITH SMOKING
Long-term consequences of smoking is associated with
following non-neoplastic respiratory insufficiency:
Smoking-related COPD:  due to chronic bronchitis and
emphysema.
Smoking-related ILD: i.e. chronic restrictive pulmo-
nary disease due to desquamative interstitial pneumonia
(DIP), respiratory bronchiolitis-associated ILD, and
pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (eosinophilic
granuloma of the lung).
DESQUAMATIVE INTERSTITIAL PNEUMONIA (DIP).
It is an uncommon condition occurring exclusively in
smokers in 4th to 5th decades of life and is more common in
males. Most patients present with dyspnoea and cough.
Chest X-ray shows peculiar diffuse hazy opacities which
characterize all ILDs. DIP was earlier thought to represent
forerunner lesion in the sequence of development of
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, DIP has minimal
fibrosis and has a far better prognosis on cessation of smoking
compared to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
Microscopically, the features are as under:
i)
Hallmark finding is collections of large number of
intraalveolar macrophages having abundant cytoplasm
and containing brown-black pigment and are termed as
smokers’ macrophages.
ii) The intervening septa contain a few lymphocytes,
plasma cells and an occasional eosinophil.
iii) Late cases show mild interstitial fibrosis.
RESPIRATORY BRONCHIOLITIS-ASSOCIATED ILD.
Respiratory bronchiolitis is a far more common lesion in
chronic smokers than DIP and is considered a milder form
of DIP having similar clinical presentation. Respiratory
bronchiolitis-associated ILD is the term used for advanced
cases who develop impaired pulmonary function and
radiologic features.
The condition resolves following cessation of smoking.
Microscopically, it is characterised by following features:
i) Patchy and bronchiolocentric location of similar
smokers’ macrophages as are seen in DIP.
ii) Peribronchial infiltrate of lymphocytes and histiocytes.
iii) There may be mild peribronchial fibrosis.
iv) Centriacinar emphysema may coexist.
PULMONARY LANGERHANS CELL HISTIOCYTOSIS.
This is an uncommon smoking-related ILD occurring in
younger men (20-40 years). Clinically, the features may vary
from an asymptomatic state to a rapidly progressive course.
Symptomatic cases present with cough, dyspnoea, weight
loss and fever. CT scan shows presence of ill-defined stellate
nodules and thin-walled cysts.
Discontinuation of smoking leads to reversal of the
condition.
Microscopically, the features are as under:
i) There is presence of poorly-defined nodules distributed
in peribronchiolar location while intervening lung
parenchyma is uninvolved.
ii) Characteristically, these nodules are sclerosing and
contain Langerhans cells along with other inflammatory
cells.
iii) Progressive cases have fibrosis with concomitant cystic
change.
TUMOURS OF LUNGS
A number of benign and malignant tumours occur in the
lungs but the primary lung cancer, commonly termed
bronchogenic carcinoma, is the most common (95% of all
primary lung tumours). The lung is also the commonest site
for metastasis from carcinomas and sarcomas. A histologic
classification of various benign and malignant tumours of
lungs as recommended by the World Health Organisation is
given in Table 17.10.
BRONCHOGENIC CARCINOMA
The term bronchogenic carcinoma is commonly used for
cancer of the lungs which includes carcinomas arising from

497
CHAPTER 17
The Respiratory System
the respiratory epithelium lining the bronchi, bronchioles and
alveoli.
INCIDENCE AND CLASSIFICATION. Lung cancer is the
most common primary malignant tumour in men and
accounts for nearly 30% of all cancer deaths in both sexes in
developing countries. Currently, the incidence of lung cancer
in females in the United States has already exceeded breast
cancer as a cause of death in women. Cancer of the lung is a
disease of middle and late life with peak incidence in 55-65
years of age, after which there is gradual fall in its incidence.
Of late, there has been slight decline in lung cancer deaths in
males due to smoking cessation efforts which started in the
West 4 decades back and has started yielding results.
However, worldwide the scene on its incidence and
prognosis are quite grim; data from International Agency
for Research on Cancer estimate that worldwide by the year
2030 there would be about 10 million deaths per year from
lung cancer.
There are 5 main histologic types of lung cancer:
i)
Squamous cell or epidermoid carcinoma
ii)  Small cell carcinoma
iii) Adenocarcinoma (including bronchioalveolar
carcinoma)
iv) Large cell carcinoma
v) Combined squamous cell carcinoma and adeno-
carcinoma (adenosquamous carcinoma).
As per reports on international data for the last 25
years, while there has been decline in the incidence of
small cell carcinoma, incidence of adenocarcinoma of the
lung has risen and has surpassed squamous cell carcinoma
as the most frequent histologic subtype of lung cancer.
However, for therapeutic purposes, bronchogenic
carcinoma can be classified into 3 groups:
1.
Small cell carcinomas, SCC (20-25%)
2.
Non-small cell carcinomas, NSCC (70-75%) (includes
squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell
carcinoma)
3.
Combined/mixed patterns (5-10%).
ETIOLOGY. The high incidence of lung cancer is associated
with a number of etiologic factors, most important of which
is cigarette smoking.
1.
Smoking. The most important factor for high incidence
of all forms of bronchogenic carcinoma is tobacco smoking.
About 80% of the lung cancer occurs in active smokers. A
number of evidences support the positive relationship of lung
cancer with tobacco smoking (see page 237):
i)
Total dose: There is a direct statistical correlation between
death rate from lung cancer and the total amount of cigarettes
smoked e.g.
An average regular smoker has 10 times greater risk of
developing lung cancer than a non-smoker.
The risk of smokers of more than 2 packs (40 cigarettes)
per day for 20 years is 60-70 times greater than a non-smoker.
Cessation of smoking by a regular smoker results in
gradual decline in the chances of developing lung cancer.
After 10 years of abstinence from smoking, the risk declines
but never returns to the non-smoker level.
Pipe and cigar smokers, though have higher risk than
non-smokers but are at lesser risk than cigarette smokers.
ii) Histologic alterations: The association of tobacco
smoking is strongest for squamous cell carcinoma and small
cell carcinoma of the lung. More than 90% of smokers have
sequential epithelial changes in the respiratory tract in the
form of squamous metaplasia, dysplasia and carcinoma in
situ (Fig. 17.33).
iii)  Mechanism: How tobacco smoking causes lung cancer
is not quite clear. However, following facts have been
observed:
Analysis of the tar from cigarette smoke has revealed a
number of known carcinogens (e.g. polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, nitrosamines) and tumour promoters (e.g.
phenol derivatives).
In experimental animal studies, it has been possible to
induce cancer by skin painting experiments with smoke-tar.

Systemic Pathology
However, it has not been possible to reproduce pattern of
human respiratory tract cancer, probably because of the
difficulty in reproducing human smoking methods in
animals.
2.
Other factors. Although smoking is the dominant
etiologic factor in lung cancer, 15% cases of lung cancer occur
in non-smokers, more so in women probably related to
hormonal factors. A few other factors implicated in lung
cancer are as follows:
i) Atmospheric pollution. There is increased risk of developing
bronchogenic carcinoma in non-smokers living in
industrialised and smoky cities than in the less polluted rural
areas. It is possible that specific industrial pollutants may be
at fault as evidenced by high rates for lung cancer in people
living in the neighbourhood of petrochemical industries.
ii) Occupational causes. There are a number of well-esta-
blished occupational causes of lung cancer. These include
workers exposed to asbestos, radiation of all types, bis-ethers,
nickel, beryllium, arsenic, metallic iron and iron-oxide. Some
industrial carcinogens and cigarette smoking have
cocarcinogenic effect, particularly in uranium mines and
asbestos workers.
iii) Dietary factors. Susceptibility to respiratory cancers is
increased in vitamin A deficiency. Smokers with low vitamin
A intake have a greater risk of lung cancer than those with
vitamin A-rich diet. The incidence of lung cancer is inversely
related to socioeconomic level reflecting their dietary pattern.
iv) Chronic scarring. Peripheral adenocarcinomas occur more
frequently in areas of chronic scarring caused by chronic
inflammatory changes, old tuberculosis, asbestosis, chronic
interstitial fibrosis, old infarcts and in scleroderma.
MOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS. Molecular studies have
revealed that there are several genetic alterations in cancer
stem cells which produce clones of malignant cells to form
tumour mass. Following genetic changes have been found:
1. Activation of growth-promoting oncogenes: Mutation in
K-RAS oncogene has been seen as the dominant change in
lung cancer. Besides, there is mutation in tyrosine kinase
domain of EGFR oncogene in cases of adenocarcinoma lung
in non-smokers. Other mutations include BRAF, PIK3CA and
MYC family, and overexpression of bcl-2 and other
antiapoptotic proteins.
2. Inactivation of tumour-suppressor genes. Inactivation of
tumour suppressor genes has been found as another
molecular mechanism in lung cancer. Many tumour
suppressor genes have been found on chromosome 3p in lung
cancer cases. These include inactivation of  p53 and Rb gene.
Besides, some tumour-acquired promoter genes have been
identified in lung cancer e.g. p16, RASSFIA etc, which cause
loss of normal function of growth-regulatory tumour
suppressor genes.
3. Autocrine growth factors. Studies have shown that lung
cancer is a multistep process—initiator carcinogen causing
mutation, followed by action of tumour promoters.  Nicotine
acts as both initiator as well as promoter carcinogen.
Derivatives of nicotine in  smoke unmask and expresses
nicotine  acetylcholine receptors which activate the signaling
pathway in tumour, blocking the  apoptosis. Promoters also
include several hormones which are elaborated by lung
cancer by autocrine pathway as part of paraneoplastic
syndrome.
4. Inherited predisposition. Although not common, but there
are a few examples of inheritance of lung cancer as under:
i) Patients of Li-Fraumeni syndrome who inherit p53
mutation may develop lung cancer.
ii) Clinical cases of retinoblastoma having mutation in Rb
gene are predisposed to develop lung cancer if they live up
to adulthood.
iii) First-degree relatives of lung cancer patients have a 2-3
fold higher risk of developing lung cancer in their lifetime.
iv) Mutations of cytochrome P450 system have been
identified in lung cancer patients; P450 metabolises chemical
carcinogen in tobacco smoke (page 216).
5. Molecular targets for therapy and survival prediction.
Knowledge on the insight into molecular biology and
pathogenesis of lung cancer has applications in discovering
newer molecules for targeted therapy, predicting response
to treatment and survival:
i) EGFR mutations and NSCC therapy: It has been reported
that 70% cases of NSCC have overexpression of EGFR protein
Figure 17.33
Schematic representation of sequential development of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.

499
CHAPTER 17
The Respiratory System
or amplification of the EGFR gene. EGFR belonging to ERBB
(HER) family of protooncogenes through mutation in its
tyrosine kinase (TK) domain plays a role in both extracelluar
and intracellular signaling resulting in tumour cell
proliferation, metastasis and antiapoptotic action. Targeted
molecular therapy against these mutations in EGFR include
EGFR-TK inhibitor  oral therapy.
ii) VEGF and monoclonal therapy: Although not mutated, VEGF
is excessively produced in lung cancer and contributes to
tumour angiogenesis. Monoclonal antibody therapy against
EGFR in conjunction with chemotherapy has been used for
curtailing tumour angiogenesis in lung caner.
iii) Molecular signature gene for prediction: Recent proteomic
studies at research level have shown that each patient has
unique protein pattern in the serum (i.e. molecular
signatures) which may be used for early diagnosis, predict
drug resistance, response to treatment and survival, but these
are yet to be applied in clinical settings.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Bronchogenic carcinoma
can occur anywhere in the lung but the most common
location is hilar, followed in descending frequency by
peripheral type.
Grossly, these 2 main types show variation in appearance:
1.
Hilar type (Fig. 17.34,A): Most commonly, the lung
cancer arises in the main bronchus or one of its segmental
branches in the hilar parts of the lung, more often on the
right side. The tumour begins as a small roughened area
on the bronchial mucosa at the bifurcation. As the tumour
enlarges, it thickens the bronchial mucosa producing
nodular or ulcerated surface. As the nodules coalesce, the
carcinoma grows into a friable spherical mass, 1 to 5 cm
in diameter, narrowing and occluding the lumen. The cut
surface of the tumour is yellowish-white with foci of
necrosis and haemorrhages which may produce cavitary
lesions (Table 17.11 sums up a list of common conditions
having pulmonany cavitary lesions or ‘honey-comb lung’
during the course of different lung diseases). It is common
to find secondary changes in bronchogenic carcinoma of
lung such as bronchopneumonia, abscess formation and
bronchiectasis as a result of obstruction and intercurrent
infections. The tumour soon spreads within the lungs by
direct extension or by lymphatics, and to distant sites by
lymphatic or haematogenous routes, as described later.
2.
Peripheral type (Fig. 17.34,B): A small proportion of
lung cancers, chiefly adenocarcinomas including
bronchioloalveolar carcinomas, originate from a small
peripheral bronchiole but the exact site of origin may not
be discernible. The tumour may be a single nodule or
multiple nodules in the periphery of the lung producing
pneumonia-like consolidation of a large part of the lung.
The cut surface of the tumour is greyish and mucoid.
Histologically, as per the WHO classification outlined in
Table 17.10, five main histologic types of bronchogenic
carcinoma are distinguished which is important because
of prognostic and therapeutic considerations. However,
from clinical point of view, distinction between small cell
(SCC) and non-small cell carcinomas (NSCC) is important
because the two not only differ in morphology, but there
are major differences in immunophenotyping and
response to treatment discussed above. The major
differences between SCC and NSCC of the lung are
summed up in Table 17.12.
1.
Squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma: This has been
the most common histologic subtype of bronchogenic
carcinoma until recently and is found more commonly in
men, often with history of tobacco smoking. These
tumours usually arise in a large bronchus and are prone
to massive necrosis and cavitation (Fig. 17.35). The tumour
is diagnosed microscopically by identification of either
intercellular bridges or keratinisation. The tumour may
show varying histologic grades of differentiation such as
well-differentiated, moderately-differentiated and poorly-
differentiated (Fig. 17.36). Occasionally, a variant of
squamous cell carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, having
biphasic pattern of growth due to the presence of a

component of squamous cell carcinoma and the other
sarcoma-like spindle cell component, is found.
Usually the spread of squamous cell carcinoma is more
rapid than the other histologic types of NSCC. Frequently,
the edge of the growth and the adjoining uninvolved
bronchi show squamous metaplasia, epithelial dysplasia
and carcinoma in situ.
2.
Small cell carcinoma: Small cell carcinomas are
frequently hilar or central in location, have strong
relationship to cigarette smoking and are highly malignant
tumours. They are most often associated with ectopic
hormone production because of the presence of
neurosecretory granules in majority of tumour cells which
are similar to those found in argentaffin or Kulchitsky cells
normally found in bronchial epithelium. By immuno-
histochemistry, these tumour cells are positive for
neuroendocrine markers: chromogranin, neuron-specific
enolase (NSE) and synaptophysin. Small cell carcinomas
have 3 subtypes:
i)
Oat cell carcinoma is composed of uniform, small cells,
larger than lymphocytes with dense, round or oval nuclei
having diffuse chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli and very
sparse cytoplasm (oat = a form of grain). These cells are
organised into cords, aggregates and ribbons or around
small blood vessels forming pseudorosettes (Fig. 17.37).
ii) Small cell carcinoma, intermediate cell type is composed of
cells slightly larger than those of oat cell carcinoma and
have similar nuclear characteristics but have more
abundant cytoplasm. These cells are organised into lobules.
iii) Combined oat cell carcinoma is a tumour in which there
is a definite component of oat cell carcinoma with
squamous cell and/or adenocarcinoma.
3.
Adenocarcinoma: Adenocarcinoma, also called
peripheral carcinoma due to its location and scar carcinoma
due to its association with areas of chronic scarring, is the
most common bronchogenic carcinoma in women and is

slow-growing. Recent estimates on adenocarcinoma place
this as the most frequent histologic subtype of lung cancer.
Adenocarcinoma is further subclassified into 4 types:
i)
Acinar adenocarcinoma which has predominance of
glandular structure and often occurs in the larger bronchi.
ii) Papillary adenocarcinoma which has a pronounced
papillary configuration and is frequently peripherally
located in the lungs and is found in relation to pulmonary
scars (scar carcinoma).
iii) Bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma is characterised by
cuboidal to tall columnar and mucus-secreting epithelial
cells growing along the existing alveoli and forming
numerous papillary structures (Fig. 17.38). Ultrastruc-
turally, these tumour cells resemble Clara cells or less often
type II pneumocytes.
iv) Solid carcinoma is a poorly-differentiated adenocarci-
noma lacking acini, tubules or papillae but having mucus-
containing vacuoles in many tumour cells.
4.
Large cell carcinoma: These are undifferentiated
carcinomas which lack the specific features by which they
could be assigned into squamous cell carcinoma or
adenocarcinoma. Large cell carcinomas are more common
in men, have strong association with cigarette smoking
and are highly malignant tumours. The tumour cells have
large nuclei, prominent nucleoli, abundant cytoplasm and
well-defined cell borders. Variants of large cell
undifferentiated carcinomas include giant cell carcinoma
with prominence of highly pleomorphic multinucleate
cells and clear cell carcinoma composed of cells with clear
or foamy cytoplasm without mucin.
5.
Adenosquamous carcinoma: These are a small
proportion of peripheral scar carcinomas having clear
evidence of both keratinisation and glandular
differentiation.
SPREAD. Bronchogenic carcinoma can invade the adjoin-
ing structures directly, or may spread by lymphatic and
haematogenous routes.

Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Islands of invading malignant squamous cells are seen. A few well-developed cell nests
with keratinisation are evident.

502
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
1.
Direct spread. The tumour extends directly by invading
through the wall of the bronchus and destroys and replaces
the peribronchial lung tissue. As it grows further, it spreads
to the opposite bronchus and lung, into the pleural cavity,
the pericardium and the myocardium and along the great
vessels of the heart causing their constriction. Extension of
the cancer located at the apex of the lung into the thoracic
cage may involve brachial plexus and the sympathetic chain
causing pain and sensory disturbances, so called Pancoast’s
syndrome.
2.
Lymphatic spread. Initially, hilar lymph nodes are
affected. Later, lymphatic metastases occur to the other
groups leading to spread to mediastinal, cervical,
supraclavicular and para-aortic lymph nodes. Invasion of the
thoracic duct may produce chylous ascites.
3.
Haematogenous spread. Distant metastases via blood
stream are widespread and early. The sites affected, in
descending order of involvement, are: the liver, adrenals,
bones, pancreas, brain, opposite lung, kidneys and thyroid.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Symptoms of lung cancer are quite
variable and result from local effects, effects due to occlusion
of a bronchus, direct and distant metastases, and
paraneoplastic syndromes. Diagnostic aids include radiologic
examination and CT scan of the chest, cytologic examination
of the sputum, bronchial washings and bronchioalveolar
lavage.
1.
Local symptoms. Most common local complaints are
cough, chest pain, dyspnoea and haemoptysis. (A list of
various causes of haemoptysis is summed up in Table 17.13).
2.
Bronchial obstructive symptoms. Occlusion of a
bronchus may result in bronchopneumonia, lung abscess and
bronchiectasis in the lung tissue distal to the site of
obstruction and cause their attendant symptoms like fever,
productive cough, pleural effusion and weight loss.
3.
Symptoms due to metastases. Distant spread may
produce varying features and sometimes these are the first
manifestation of lung cancer. These include: superior vena
caval syndrome, painful bony lesions, paralysis of recurrent
nerve and other neurologic manifestations resulting from
brain metastases.
4.
Paraneoplastic syndromes. A number of paraneoplastic
syndromes (page 231) are associated with lung cancer. These
include the following:
i)
Ectopic hormone production: Different hormonal
syndromes are characteristic of different histologic types of
lung cancer. Small cell carcinomas are associated most often
with ectopic hormone production. The various hormones
elaborated by lung cancer are as follows:
a) ACTH, producing Cushing’s syndrome.
b) ADH, inducing hyponatraemia.
c) Parathormone, causing hypercalcaemia.
d) Calcitonin, producing hypocalcaemia.
e) Gonadotropins, causing gynaecomastia.
f)
Serotonin, associated with carcinoid syndrome.

neuropathy and subacute cerebellar degeneration.
b) Skeletal e.g. clubbing and hypertrophic osteoarthro-
pathy.
c)
Cutaneous e.g. acanthosis nigricans and dermato-
myopathy.
d) Cardiovascular e.g. migratory thrombophlebitis
(Trousseau’s syndrome), nonbacterial thrombotic
endocarditis.
e) Haematologic e.g. abnormalities in coagulation and
leukaemoid reaction.
STAGING AND PROGNOSIS. The widely accepted clinical
staging of lung cancer is according to the TNM classification,
combining features of primary Tumours, Nodal involvement
and distant Metastases. TNM staging divides all lung cancers
into the following 4 stages:
Occult: Malignant cells in the bronchopulmonary secretions
but no evidence of primary tumour or metastasis.
Stage I: Tumour less than 3 cm, with or without ipsilateral
nodal involvement, no distant metastasis.
Stage II: Tumour larger than 3 cm, with ipsilateral hilar lymph
node involvement, no distant metastasis.
Stage III: Tumour of any size, involving adjacent structures,
involving contralateral lymph nodes or distant metastasis.
In general, tumour size larger than 5 cm has worse
prognosis. Symptomatic patients, particularly with systemic
symptoms, fare far badly than the nonsymptomatic patients.
The overall prognosis of bronchogenic carcinoma is dismal.
However, 5-year survival rate with surgery combined with
radiotherapy or chemotherapy in the last 30 years has
doubled from its earlier rate of about 9% to present rate of
15%. Adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma which
are localised, are resectable and have a slightly better
prognosis. Small cell carcinoma has the worst prognosis since
surgical treatment is ineffective though the tumour is
sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
BRONCHIAL CARCINOID AND
OTHER NEUROENDOCRINE  TUMOURS
Neuroendocrine tumours of the lung represent a continuum
spectrum of lung tumours with progressively increasing
aggressiveness which include: typical carcinoid (least
aggressive), atypical carcinoid, and large cell endocrine
carcinoma, and also small cell carcinoma (most aggressive).
All these tumours arise from neuroendocrine (Kulchitsky)
cells of bronchial mucosa. Formerly, bronchial carcinoids
used to be classified as ‘bronchial adenomas’ but now it is
known that they are locally invasive and have the capacity
to metastasise. Bronchial carcinoids tend to occur at a
younger age than bronchogenic carcinoma, often appearing
below the age of 40 years, and are not related to cigarette
smoking.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Bronchial carcinoids
resemble their intestinal counterparts described in
Chapter 20.
Grossly, bronchial carcinoids most commonly arise from
a major bronchus and project into the bronchial lumen as
a spherical polypoid mass, 3-4 cm in diameter. Less
commonly, the tumour may grow into the bronchial wall
and produce collar-button like lesion. The overlying
bronchial mucosa is usually intact. Cut surface of the
tumour is yellow-tan in colour.
Histologically, the tumour is composed of uniform
cuboidal cells forming aggregates, trabeculae or ribbons
separated by fine fibrous septa. The tumour cells have
abundant, finely granular cytoplasm and oval central
nuclei with clumped nuclear chromatin. Mitoses are rare
and necrosis is uncommon (Fig. 17.39). The secretory
granules of bronchial carcinoids resemble those of other
foregut carcinoids and stain positively with argyrophilic
stains in which exogenous reducing agent is added for
the reaction. Immunohistochemically, markers for
neuroendocrine stain positive and include NSE,
chromogranin, synaptophysin and neurofilaments.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Bronchial carcinoids occur at a
relatively early age and have equal sex incidence. Most of
the symptoms in bronchial carcinoids occur as a result of
bronchial obstruction such as cough, haemoptysis, atelectasis
and secondary infection. About 5-10% of bronchial carcinoids
metastasise to the liver and these cases are capable of
producing carcinoid syndrome (Chapter 20).
HAMARTOMA
Hamartoma is a tumour-like lesion composed of an abnormal
admixture of pulmonary tissue components and is
discovered incidentally as a coin-lesion in the chest-X-ray.
Figure 17.39
Central carcinoid of the lung. The tumour shows a
characteristic nested of cells separated by fibrovascular septa. These
nests are composed of uniform cuboidal cells having granular cytoplasm.

504
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Pulmonary hamartomas are of 2 types: chondromatous and
leiomyomatous.
Chondromatous hamartoma is more common and
usually asymptomatic. It forms a solitary, spherical mass,
2-5 cm in diameter, usually at the periphery of the lung.
Typically, it shows nodules of cartilage associated with
fibrous and adipose tissue admixed with bronchial
epithelium.
Leiomyomatous hamartoma has a prominent smooth
muscle component and bronchiolar structures. They are
frequently multiple, 1-2 mm in diameter and are more
commonly located near the pleura.
METASTATIC LUNG TUMOURS
Secondary tumours of the lungs are more common than the
primary pulmonary tumours. Metastases from carcinomas
as well as sarcomas arising from anywhere in the body may
spread to the lung by haematogenous or lymphatic routes,
or by direct extension. Blood-borne metastases are the most
common since emboli of tumour cells from any malignant
tumour entering the systemic venous circulation are likely
to be lodged in the lungs. Metastases are most common in
the peripheral part of the lung forming single or multiple,
discrete nodular lesions which appear radiologically as
‘cannon-ball secondaries’ (Fig. 17.40). Less frequently, the
metastatic growth is confined to peribronchiolar and
perivascular locations which is due to spread via lymphatics.
Most common sources of metastases in the lungs are:
carcinomas of the bowel, breast, thyroid, kidney, pancreas,
lung (ipsilateral or contralateral) and liver. Other tumours
which frequently metastasise to the lungs are osteogenic
sarcoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms’ tumour, melanoma,
lymphomas and leukaemias.
PLEURA
NORMAL STRUCTURE
Visceral pleura covers the lungs and extends into the fissures
while the parietal pleura limits the mediastinum and covers
the dome of the diaphragm and inner aspect of the chest wall.
The two layers between them enclose pleural cavity which
contains less than 15 ml of clear serous fluid.
Microscopically, both the pleural layers are lined by a single
layer of flattened mesothelial cells facing each other.
Underneath the lining cells is a thin layer of connective tissue.
Diseases affecting the pleura are nearly always secondary
to some other underlying disease. Broadly, they fall into
inflammations, non-inflammatory pleural effusions,
pneumothorax, and tumours.
INFLAMMATIONS
Inflammatory involvement of the pleura is commonly termed
pleuritis or pleurisy. Depending upon the character of resultant
exudate, it can be divided into serous, fibrinous and
serofibrinous, suppurative or empyema, and haemorrhagic
pleuritis.
1.
SEROUS, FIBRINOUS AND SEROFIBRINOUS
PLEURITIS. Acute inflammation of the pleural sac (acute
pleuritis) can result in serous, serofibrinous and fibrinous
exudate. Most of the causes of such pleuritis are infective in
origin, particularly within the lungs, such as tuberculosis,
pneumonias, pulmonary infarcts, lung abscess and
bronchiectasis. Other causes include a few collagen diseases
(e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and disseminated lupus
erythematosus), uraemia, metastatic involvement of the
pleura, irradiation of lung tumours and diffuse systemic
infections (e.g. typhoid fever, tularaemia, blastomycosis and
coccidioidomycosis).
Pleurisy causes pain in the chest on breathing and a
friction rub is audible on auscultation. In most patients, the
exudate is minimal and is resorbed resulting in resolution.
Repeated attacks of pleurisy may result in organisation
leading to fibrous adhesions and obliteration of the pleural
cavity.
2.
SUPPURATIVE PLEURITIS (EMPYEMA THORACIS).
Bacterial or mycotic infection of the pleural cavity that
converts a serofibrinous effusion into purulent exudate is
termed suppurative pleuritis or empyema thoracis. The most
common cause is direct spread of pyogenic infection from
the lung. Other causes are direct extension from subdia-
phragmatic abscess or liver abscess and penetrating injuries
to the chest wall. Occasionally, the spread may occur by
haematogenous or lymphatic routes.
In empyema, the exudate is yellow-green, creamy pus
that accumulates in large volumes. Empyema is eventually
replaced by granulation tissue and fibrous tissue. In time,
tough fibrocollagenic adhesions develop which obliterate the
cavity, and with passage of years, calcification may occur.
The effect of these is serious respiratory difficulty due to
inadequate pulmonary expansion.
Figure 17.40
Metastatic deposits in the lung.  Large parts of the
lung parenchyma are replaced by multiple, variable-sized, circumscribed
nodular masses which are grey-white in colour. Some of these show
areas of haemorrhage and necrosis.

505
CHAPTER 17
The Respiratory System
3.
HAEMORRHAGIC PLEURITIS. Haemorrhagic
pleuritis differs from haemothorax in having inflammatory
cells or exfoliated tumour cells in the exudate. The causes of
haemorrhagic pleuritis are metastatic involvement of the
pleura, bleeding disorders and rickettsial diseases.
NON-INFLAMMATORY PLEURAL EFFUSIONS
These include fluid collections in the pleural cavity such as
hydrothorax, haemothorax and chylothorax.
1.
HYDROTHORAX. Hydrothorax is non-inflammatory
accumulation of serous fluid within the pleural cavities.
Hydrothorax may be unilateral or bilateral depending upon
the underlying cause. Occasionally, an effusion is limited to
part of a pleural cavity by preexisting pleural adhesions.
The most common cause of hydrothorax, often bilateral,
is congestive heart failure. Other causes are renal failure,
cirrhosis of liver, Meig’s syndrome (Chapter 24), pulmonary
oedema and primary and secondary tumours of the lungs.
The non-inflammatory serous effusion in hydrothorax is
clear and straw-coloured and has the characteristics of
transudate with a specific gravity of under 1.012, protein
content below 1 gm/dl and little cellular content.
If the fluid collection in pleural cavity is less than 300 ml
(normal is less than 15 ml), no signs or symptoms are
produced and may be apparent in chest X-ray in standing
posture as obliterated costodiaphragmatic angle. If the
pleural cavity contains abundant fluid, it imparts a
characteristic opaque radiographic appearance to the affected
side with deviation of trachea to the opposite side. In such
cases, symptoms such as respiratory embarrassment and
dyspnoea are produced which are promptly relieved on
withdrawal of fluid.
2.
HAEMOTHORAX. Accumulation of pure blood in the
pleural cavity is termed as haemothorax. The most common
causes of haemothorax are trauma to the chest wall or to the
thoracic viscera and rupture of aortic aneurysm. It is
important to remove the blood from the pleural cavity as
early as possible. Otherwise the blood will clot and organise,
resulting in fibrous adhesions and obliteration of the pleural
cavity.
3.
CHYLOTHORAX. Chylothorax is an uncommon
condition in which there is accumulation of milky fluid of
lymphatic origin into the pleural cavity. Chylothorax results
most commonly from rupture of the thoracic duct by trauma
or obstruction of the thoracic duct such as by malignant
tumours, most often malignant lymphomas. Chylothorax is
more often confined to the left side. Chylous effusion is milky
due to high content of finely emulsified fats in the chyle.
PNEUMOTHORAX
An accumulation of air in the pleural cavity is called
pneumothorax. It may occur in one of the three circum-
stances: spontaneous, traumatic and therapeutic.
i)
Spontaneous pneumothorax occurs due to spontaneous
rupture of alveoli in any form of pulmonary disease. Most
commonly, spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in association
with emphysema, asthma and tuberculosis. Other causes
include chronic bronchitis in an old patient, bronchiectasis,
pulmonary infarction and bronchial cancer. In young
patients, recurrent spontaneous rupture of peripheral
subpleural blebs may occur without any cause resulting in
disabling condition termed spontaneous idiopathic
pneumothorax.
ii) Traumatic pneumothorax is caused by trauma to the
chest wall or lungs, ruptured oesophagus or stomach, and
surgical operations of the thorax.
iii) Therapeutic (artificial) pneumothorax used to be
employed formerly in the treatment of chronic pulmonary
tuberculosis in which air was introduced into the pleural sac
so as to collapse the lung and limit its respiratory movements.
The effects of pneumothorax due to any cause depend
upon the amount of air collected in the pleural cavity. If the
quantity of air in the pleura is small, it is resorbed. Larger
volume of air collection in the pleural cavity causes dyspnoea
and pain in the chest. Pneumothorax causes lung collapse
and pulls the mediastinum to the unaffected side.
Occasionally, the defect in the lungs is such that it acts as
flap-valve and allows entry of air during inspiration but does
not permit its escape during expiration, creating tension
pneumothorax which requires urgent relief of pressure so as
to relieve severe dyspnoea and circulatory failure.
TUMOURS OF PLEURA
Pleural tumours may be primary or secondary. In line with
pulmonary tumours, the secondary tumours in the pleura
are more common. The only important primary tumour of
pleura is mesothelioma.
MESOTHELIOMA
Mesothelioma is an uncommon tumour arising from
mesothelial lining of serous cavities, most often in pleural
cavity, and rarely in peritoneal cavity and pericardial sac.
Mesotheliomas are of 2 types—benign (solitary) and malignant
(diffuse). The biologic behaviour of pleural mesotheliomas is
usually predicted by their gross appearance—those forming
solitary, discrete masses are generally benign, whereas those
which grow diffusely are usually malignant.
Benign (Solitary) Mesothelioma
Benign or solitary mesothelioma is also called as pleural
fibroma. Asbestos exposure plays no role in etiology of benign
mesothelioma.
Grossly, it consists of a solitary, circumscribed, small, firm
mass, generally less than 3 cm in diameter. Cut surface
shows whorls of dense fibrous tissue.
Microscopically, the tumour is predominantly composed
of whorls of collagen fibres and reticulin with interspersed
fibroblasts. Rarely, mesothelial-lined clefts are seen in the
tumour.
Benign mesothelioma causes no symptoms and is
detected as an incidental radiologic finding. Sometimes the
tumour is associated with systemic syndrome of

506
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
osteoarthropathy or hypoglycaemia. Removal of the tumour
is generally curative.
Malignant (Diffuse) Mesothelioma
Malignant or diffuse mesothelioma is rare. It is a highly
malignant tumour associated with high mortality. The
tumour is significant in view of its recognised association with
occupational exposure to asbestos (particularly crocidolite) for
a number of years, usually 20 to 40 years (page 492). About
90% of malignant mesotheliomas are asbestos-related.
Mechanism of carcinogenicity by asbestos is not quite clear
but it appears that prolonged exposure of amphibole type of
asbestos is capable of inducing oncogenic mutation in the
mesothelium.  However, prolonged asbestos-exposure is
considered more significant rather than heavy exposure as
documented by occurrence of malignant mesothelioma in the
family members of asbestos workers. Although combination
of cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure greatly increases
risk to develop bronchogenic carcinoma, there is no such
extra increased risk of developing mesothelioma in asbestos
workers who smoke. Recently, SV40 (simian vacuolating
virus) antigen has also been implicated in the etiology of
mesothelioma.
Grossly, the tumour is characteristically diffuse, forming
a thick, white, fleshy coating over the parietal and visceral
surfaces (Fig. 17.41).
Figure 17.41
Malignant (diffuse) mesothelioma, gross appearance.
The tumour is seen to form a thick, white, fleshy coat over the parietal
and visceral surfaces.
Microscopically, malignant mesothelioma may have
epithelial, sarcomatoid or biphasic patterns.
i)
Epithelial pattern resembles an adenocarcinoma,
consisting of tubular and tubulo-papillary formations. The
tumour cells are usually well-differentiated, cuboidal,
flattened or columnar cells.
ii) Sarcomatoid pattern consists of spindle cell sarcoma
resembling fibrosarcoma. The tumour cells are arranged
in a storiform pattern with abundant collagen between
them.
iii) Biphasic pattern shows mixed growth having
epithelial as well as sarcomatoid pattern. Usually, there
are slit-like or gland-like spaces lined by neoplastic
mesothelial cells separated by proliferating spindle-
shaped tumour cells (Fig. 17.42).
Asbestos bodies are found in the lungs of most patients
with malignant mesothelioma of any histologic type.
Clinical manifestations include chest pain, dyspnoea,
pleural effusion and infections. The tumour spreads rapidly
by direct invasion into lung and by lymphatic spread into
hilar lymph nodes and pericardium. Sometimes distant
metastases, particularly to the liver, occur. The prognosis is
poor; 50% of patients die within one year of diagnosis.
SECONDARY PLEURAL TUMOURS
Metastatic malignancies in the pleura are more common than
the primary tumours and appear as small nodules scattered
over the lung surface. The most frequent primary malignant
tumours metastasising to the pleura are of the lung and breast
through lymphatics, and ovarian cancers via haematogenous
route.

EYE
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The structure of the eye is shown diagrammatically in
Fig. 18.1. The eyelids are covered externally by the skin and
internally by conjunctiva which is reflected over the globe of
the eye. The lacrimal glands which are compound racemose
glands are situated at the outer upper angle of the orbit. The
globe of the eye is composed of 3 layers: the cornea-sclera,
choroid-iris, and retina.
The cornea consists of stratified epithelium which may
be regarded as continuation of the conjunctiva over the
cornea. The subepithelial stroma consists of fibrous
connective tissue, and the posterior endothelium-lined thin
elastic membrane called Descemet’s membrane.
The sclera is composed of dense fibrous tissue which is
thickest at the back of the eyeball.
The choroid is the vascular membrane in contact with
the sclera. The choroid becomes thickened anteriorly forming
ciliary body, ciliary processes and contains ciliary muscle.
The iris is the continuation of the choroid which extends
in front of the lens. It is similar in structure to the choroid
but contains pigment cells.
The uveal tract consists of 3 parts—the choroid and ciliary
body posteriorly, and the iris anteriorly.
The retina is part of the central nervous system and
corresponds in extent to the choroid which it lines internally.
The retina is composed of a number of layers of cells and
their synapses which are of 3 types—external photoreceptor
cells (rods and cones), intermediate relay layer of bipolar
cells, and internal layer of ganglion cells with their axons
running into the central nervous system. The central fovea is
a specially differentiated spot in the retina posteriorly which
consists only of photosensitive cones but is devoid of
photoreceptor rods and blood vessels. Macula lutea or yellow
spot surrounds the central fovea and though not as sensitive
as central fovea, it is more so than the other parts of the retina.
At the optic disc, the fibres of the nerve fibre layer of the
retina pass into the optic nerve.
The lens is the biconvex mass of laminated transparent
tissue with elastic capsule.
The anterior chamber is the space filled with the aqueous
humour, and is bounded by the cornea in front and the iris
behind, with anterior surface of the lens exposed in the pupil.
The posterior chamber containing aqueous humour is
the triangular space between the back of the iris, the anterior
surface of the lens and ciliary body forming its apex at the
pupillary margin.
The vitreous chamber is the large space behind the lens
containing gelatinous material, the vitreous humour.
The main function of the eye is visual acuity which
depends upon a transparent focussing system comprised by
the cornea, lens, transparent media consisting of aqueous
and vitreous humours, and a normal retinal and neural
conduction system. The cornea and lens receive their nutrient
demands from the aqueous humour produced by the ciliary
processes. The intraocular pressure is normally 15-20 mmHg
and depends upon the rate of aqueous production and on
the resistance in the outflow system.
CONGENITAL LESIONS
RETROLENTAL FIBROPLASIA (RETINOPATHY OF
PREMATURITY). This is a developmental disorder occur-
ring in premature infants who have been given oxygen-
therapy at birth. The basic defect lies in the developmental
prematurity of the retinal blood vessels which are extremely
sensitive to high dose of oxygen-therapy. The peripheral
retina is incompletely vascularised in such infants and
exposure to oxygen results in vaso-obliteration. On stoppage
of oxygen-therapy, vasoproliferation begins leading to
neovascularisation, cicatrisation and retinal detachment.
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA. Retinitis pigmentosa is a group
of systemic and ocular diseases of unknown etiology,
characterised by degeneration of the retinal pigment
epithelium. The condition can have various inheritance
patterns—autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive trait, or
sex-linked recessive trait. The earliest clinical finding is night
blindness due to loss of rods and may progress to total
blindness.
Figure 18.1
Schematic diagram of longitudinal section of the eyeball.

508
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Histologically, there is disappearance of rods and cones
of the photoreceptor layer of the retina, degeneration of
retinal pigment epithelium and ingrowth of glial
membrane on the optic disc.
INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS
Inflammatory conditions of the eye are designated according
to the tissue affected. ‘Uveitis’ is the commonly used term
for the ocular inflammation of the uveal tract which is the
most vascular tissue of the eye. However, specific designation
is used for the type of tissue of eye inflamed. Some of the
important types are described below.
STYE (HORDEOLUM). Stye or ‘external hordeolum’ is an
acute suppurative inflammation of the sebaceous glands of
Zeis, the apocrine glands of Moll and the eyelash follicles.
The less common ‘internal hordeolum’ is an acute
suppurative inflammation of the meibomian glands.
CHALAZION. Chalazion is a very common lesion and is
the chronic inflammatory process involving the meibomian
glands. It occurs as a result of obstruction to the drainage of
secretions. The inflammatory process begins with destruction
of meibomian glands and duct and subsequently involves
tarsal plate.
Histologically, the chalazion gives the appearance of a
chronic inflammatory granuloma located in the tarsus and
contains fat globules in the centre of the granulomas i.e.
appearance of a lipogranuloma (Fig. 18.2).
ENDOPHTHALMITIS. Endophthalmitis is an acute
suppurative intraocular inflammation which may be of
exogenous or endogenous origin. The exogenous agents may
be bacteria, viruses or fungi introduced into the eye during
an accidental or surgical perforating wound. The endogenous
agents include opportunistic infections which may cause
endophthalmitis via haematogenous route e.g. candidiasis,
toxoplasmosis, nocardiosis, aspergillosis and cryptococcosis.
CONJUNCTIVITIS AND KERATOCONJUNCTIVITIS.
Conjunctiva and cornea are constantly exposed to various
types of physical, chemical, microbial (bacteria, fungi,
viruses) and allergic agents and hence prone to develop acute,
subacute and chronic inflammations. In the acute stage, there
is corneal oedema and infiltration by inflammatory cells,
affecting the transparency of the cornea. In the more chronic
form of inflammation, there is proliferation of small blood
vessels in the normally avascular cornea and infiltration by
lymphocytes and plasma cells (pannus formation).
TRACHOMA AND INCLUSION CONJUNCTIVITIS.
Both these conditions are caused by Chlamydia or TRIC
agents. Trachoma is caused by C. trachomatis while inclusion
conjunctivitis is caused by C. oculogenitalis. Trachoma is
widely prevalent in the underdeveloped and developing
countries of the world and is responsible for blindness on a
large scale. In the early stage of infection, the trachoma agent
that infects the conjunctival epithelium, can be recognised
in the smears by the intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies
formed by the proliferating microorganisms within the cells.
Later, the conjunctiva thickens due to dense chronic
inflammatory cell infiltrate alongwith lymphoid follicles and
macrophages. The end-result is extensive corneal and
conjunctival cicatrisation accounting for blindness in
trachoma. Inclusion conjunctivitis, though caused by an
organism closely related to trachoma agent, is a much less
severe disease and causes mild keratoconjunctivitis.
GRANULOMATOUS UVEITIS. A number of chronic
granulomatous conditions may cause granulomatous uveitis.
These include bacteria (e.g. tuberculosis, leprosy, syphilis),
viruses (e.g. CMV disease, herpes zoster), fungi (e.g.
aspergillosis, blastomycosis, phycomycosis, histoplasmosis),
and certain parasites (e.g. toxoplasmosis, onchocerciasis).
Granulomatous uveitis is common in sarcoidosis as well.
SYMPATHETIC OPHTHALMIA (SYMPATHETIC
UVEITIS). This is an uncommon condition in which there is
bilateral diffuse granulomatous uveitis following penetrating
injury to one eye. The condition probably results from an
autosensitivity reaction to injured uveal tissue. It leads to a
severe visual loss in both the eyes if not diagnosed and
treated early.
Histologically, there is granulomatous uveal inflamma-
tion consisting of epithelioid cells and lymphocytes
affecting both the eyes. There is no necrosis and no
neutrophilic or plasma cell infiltration. If lens is also
injured, it results in phacoanaphylactic endophthalmitis.
VASCULAR LESIONS
DIABETIC RETINOPATHY. Diabetic retinopathy is an
important cause of blindness. It is related to the degree and
duration of glycaemic control. The condition develops in
more than 60% of diabetics 15-20 years after the onset of
Figure 18.2
Chalazion of the eyelid. There is presence of a
lipogranuloma having central pool of fat and surrounded by mixed
inflammatory cells and foreign body type multinucleated giant cells.

509
CHAPTER 18
The Eye, ENT and Neck
disease, and in about 2% of diabetics causes blindness. Other
ocular complications of diabetes include glaucoma, cataract
and corneal disease. Most cases of diabetic retinopathy occur
over the age of 50 years. The risk is greater in type 1 diabetes
mellitus than in type 2 diabetes mellitus, although in clinical
practice there are more patients of diabetic retinopathy due
to type 2 diabetes mellitus because of its higher prevalence.
Women are more prone to diabetes as well as diabetic
retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is directly correlated with
Kimmelstiel-Wilson nephropathy (page 678).
Histologically, two types of changes are described in
diabetic retinopathy—background (non-proliferative) and
proliferative retinopathy.
1.
Background (non-proliferative) retinopathy. This is
the initial retinal capillary microangiopathy. The following
changes are seen:
i)
Basement membrane shows varying thickness due to
increased synthesis of basement membrane substance.
ii) Degeneration of pericytes and some loss of endothelial
cells are found.
iii) Capillary microaneurysms appear which may develop
thrombi and get occluded.
iv) ‘Waxy exudates’ accumulate in the vicinity of
microaneurysms especially in the elderly diabetics
because of hyperlipidaemia.
v) ‘Dot and blot haemorrhages’ in the deeper layers of
retina are produced due to diapedesis of erythrocytes.
vi) Soft ‘cotton-wool spots’ appear on the retina which
are microinfarcts of nerve fibre layers. ‘Scotomas’ appear
from degeneration of nerve fibres and ganglion cells.
2.
Proliferative retinopathy (retinitis proliferans). After
many years, retinopathy becomes proliferative. Severe
ischaemia and chronic hypoxia for long period leads to
secretion of angiogenic factor by retinal cells and results
in the following changes:
i)
Neovascularisation of the retina at the optic disc.
ii) Friability of newly-formed blood vessels causes them
to bleed easily and results in vitreous haemorrhages.
iii) Proliferation of astrocytes and fibrous tissue around
the new blood vessels.
iv) Fibrovascular and gliotic tissue contracts to cause
retinal detachment and blindness.
In addition to the changes on retina, severe diabetes
may cause diabetic iridopathy with formation of adhesions
between iris and cornea (peripheral anterior synechiae)
and between iris and lens (posterior synechiae). Diabetics
also develop cataract of the lens at an earlier age than the
general population.
The pathogenesis of blindness in diabetes mellitus is
schematically outlined in Fig. 18.3.
HYPERTENSIVE RETINOPATHY. In hypertensive
retinopathy, the retinal arterioles are reduced in their
diameter leading to retinal ischaemia. In acute severe hyper-
tension as happens at the onset of malignant hypertension
and in toxaemia of pregnancy, the vascular changes are in
the form of spasms, while in chronic hypertension the
changes are diffuse in the form of onion-skin thickening of
the arteriolar walls with narrowing of the lumina (page 391).
Features of hypertensive retinopathy include the
following (Fig. 18.4):
i)
Variable degree of arteriolar narrowing due to
arteriolosclerosis.
ii) ‘Flame-shaped’ haemorrhages in the retinal nerve fibre
layer.
iii) Macular star i.e. exudates radiating from the centre of
macula.
iv) Cotton-wool spots i.e. fluffy white bodies in the
superficial layer of retina.
v) Microaneurysms.
vi) Arteriovenous nicking i.e. kinking of veins at sites where
sclerotic arterioles cross veins.
vii) Hard exudates due to leakage of lipid and fluid into
macula.
Figure 18.3
Schematic diagram showing the effects of diabetes mellitus on eye in causing blindness.

510
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Hypertensive retinopathy is classified according to the
severity of above lesions from grade I to IV. More serious
and severe changes with poor prognosis occur in higher
grades of hypertensive retinopathy. Malignant hypertension
is characterised by necrotising arteriolitis and fibrinoid
necrosis of retinal arterioles.
RETINAL INFARCTS. Infarcts of the retina may result from
thrombosis or embolism in central artery of the retina,
causing ischaemic necrosis of the inner two-third of the retina
while occlusion of the posterior ciliary arteries causes
ischaemia of the inner photoreceptor layer only. The usual
causes of thrombosis and embolism are atherosclerosis,
hypertension and diabetes. Occlusion of the central retinal
vein produces haemorrhagic infarction of the entire retina.
MISCELLANEOUS CONDITIONS
PINGUECULA AND PTERYGIUM. Pinguecula is a
degenerative condition of the collagen of the bulbar
conjunctiva. Clinically, the condition appears as raised
yellowish lesions on the interpalpebral bulbar conjunctiva
of both eyes in middle-aged and elderly patients.
Histologically, there is characteristic basophilic
degeneration of the subepithelial collagen of the
conjunctiva. The overlying epithelium may show
acanthosis, hyperkeratosis or dyskeratosis.
Pterygium is a lesion closely related to pinguecula but differs
from the latter by being located at the limbus and often
involves the cornea; hence the lesion is more important
clinically.
SENILE MACULAR DEGENERATION. Age-related
degeneration of the macular region of the retina is an
important cause of bilateral central visual loss in the elderly
people.
Histologically, in the early stage, there is irregular
thickening of the Bruch’s membrane that separates retinal
pigment epithelium from the choroid, and there is
degeneration of the photoreceptor and pigment
epithelium. Later, there is ingrowth of capillaries into the
choroid, exudation and haemorrhage under the retina
which may eventually get organised and heal by fibrosis
and result in permanent loss of central vision.
RETINAL DETACHMENT. Retinal detachment is the
separation of the neurosensory retina from the retinal
pigment epithelium. It may occur spontaneously in older
individuals past 50 years of age, or may be secondary to
trauma in the region of head and neck. Normally, the rods
and cones of the photoreceptor layer are interdigitated with
projections of the retinal pigment epithelium, but the two
can separate readily in some disease processes. There are 3
pathogenetic mechanisms of retinal detachment:
i)
Pathologic processes in the vitreous or anterior segment,
causing traction on the retina.
ii) Collection of serous fluid in the sub-retinal space from
inflammation or tumour in the choroid.
iii) Accumulation of vitreous under the retina through a hole
or a tear in the retina.
PHTHISIS BULBI. Phthisis bulbi is the end-stage of
advanced degeneration and disorganisation of the entire
eyeball in which the intraocular pressure is decreased and
the eyeball shrinks. The causes of such end-stage blind eye
are trauma, glaucoma and intraocular inflammations.
Histologically, there is marked atrophy and disorga-
nisation of all the ocular structures, and markedly
thickened sclera. Even osseous metaplasia may occur.
CATARACT. The cataract is the opacification of the normally
crystalline lens which leads to gradual painless blurring of
vision. The various causes of cataract are: senility, congenital
(e.g. Down syndrome, rubella, galactosaemia), traumatic (e.g.
penetrating injury, electrical injury), metabolic (e.g. diabetes,
hypoparathyroidism), and associated with drugs (e.g. long-
term corticosteroid therapy), smoking and heavy alcohol
consumption. The most common is, however, idiopathic
senile cataract.
Histologically, the changes in the cataractous lens are
similar irrespective of the underlying cause. The lens fibres
undergo degeneration, fragmentation and liquefaction but
the central nucleus remains intact because it is quite
sclerotic.
GLAUCOMA. Glaucoma is a group of ocular disorders that
have in common increased intraocular pressure. Glaucoma
is one of the leading causes of blindness because of the
ocular tissue damage produced by raised intraocular
pressure. In almost all cases, glaucoma occurs due to
impaired outflow of aqueous humour, though there is a
theoretical possibility of increased production of aqueous
by the ciliary body causing glaucoma. The obstruction to
the aqueous flow may occur as a result of developmental
malformations (congenital glaucoma); or due to
complications of some other diseases such as uveitis,
trauma, intraocular haemorrhage and tumours (secondary
glaucoma); or may be primary glaucoma which is typically
bilateral and is the most common type.
Figure 18.4
Ocular lesions in hypertension.

511
CHAPTER 18
The Eye, ENT and Neck
There are 2 types of primary glaucoma—primary open-
angle (chronic simple glaucoma) and primary angle-closure
(acute congestive glaucoma). Primary open-angle glaucoma
is more common type and is usually a genetically-determined
disease. Primary angle-closure glaucoma occurs due to
shallow anterior chamber and hence narrow angle causing
blockage to aqueous outflow.
In all types of glaucoma, degenerative changes appear
after some duration and eventually damage to the optic nerve
and retina occurs.
PAPILLOEDEMA. Papilloedema is oedema of the optic disc
resulting from increased intracranial pressure. This is due
to anatomic continuation of the subarachnoid space of the
brain around the optic nerve so that raised intracranial
pressure is passed onto the optic disc area. In acute
papilloedema, there is oedema, congestion and haemorrhage
at the optic disc. In chronic papilloedema, there is degene-
ration of nerve fibres, gliosis and optic atrophy.
SJÖGREN’S SYNDROME. Sjögren’s syndrome is charac-
terised by triad of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, xerostomia (sicca
syndrome) and rheumatoid arthritis. The condition occurs
due to immunologically-mediated destruction of the lacrimal
and salivary glands along- with another autoimmune disease
(Chapter 4).
MIKULICZ’S SYNDROME. This is characterised by
inflammatory enlargement of lacrimal and salivary glands
(Chapter 19). The condition may occur with Sjögren’s
syndrome, or with some diseases like sarcoidosis, leukaemia,
lymphoma and macroglobulinaemia.
TUMOURS AND TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS
The eye and its adnexal structures are the site of a variety of
benign and malignant tumours as well as tumour-like lesions.
A brief list of such lesions is given in Table 18.1. The
morphology of many of these tumours and tumour-like
lesions is identical to similar lesions elsewhere in the body.
However, a few examples peculiar to the eye are described
below.
Inflammatory Pseudotumours
These are a group of inflammatory enlargements, especially
in the orbit, which clinically look like tumours but surgical
exploration and pathologic examination fail to reveal any
evidence of neoplasm.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, these lesions are
circumscribed and sometimes have fibrous capsule.
Microscopically, many of the lesions can be placed in well-
established categories such as tuberculous, syphilitic,
mycotic, parasitic, foreign-body granuloma etc, while
others show non-specific histologic appearance having
abundant fibrous tissue, lymphoid follicles and
inflammatory infiltrate with prominence of eosinophils.
Sebaceous Carcinoma
This is the most frequent tumour of the eyelid next only to basal
cell carcinoma, although it is very rare tumour elsewhere in
the body. It arises either from the meibomian glands in the
tarsus or from Zeis’ glands of eyelash follicles. The tumour
is seen more commonly in the upper eyelid (basal cell
carcinoma is seen more frequently in the lower eyelid).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour
appears as a localised or diffuse swelling of the tarsus, or
may be in the form of ulcerated or papillomatous tumour
at the lid margin.
Microscopically, the tumour may show well-differen-
tiated lobules of tumour cells with sebaceous differen-
tiation, or may be poorly-differentiated tumour requiring
confirmation by fat stains (Fig. 18.5). These tumours can

metastasise to the regional lymph nodes as well as to
distant sites.
Uveal Malignant Melanoma
Malignant melanomas arising from neural crest-derived
pigment epithelium of the uvea is the most common primary
ocular malignancy in the white adults in North America and
Europe. It is discussed in detail in Chapter 26.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the malignant
melanoma appears as a pigmented mass, most commonly
in the posterior choroid, and less often in the ciliary body
and iris. The mass projects into the vitreous cavity with
retina covering it (Fig. 18.6).
Microscopically, age-old classification of Callender (1931)
which has prognostic significance is still followed with
some modifications:
1.
Spindle A melanoma is composed of uniform,
spindle-shaped cells containing spindled nuclei. Nucleoli
are indistinct and mitotic figures are rare. Tumours of this
type have the most favourable prognosis (85% 10-year
survival).
2.
Spindle B melanoma is composed of larger and plump
spindle-shaped cells with ovoid nuclei. Nucleoli are
conspicuous and a few mitotic figures are present. These
tumours carry slightly worse prognosis (80% 10-year
survival).
3.
Epithelioid melanoma consists of larger, irregular and
pleomorphic cells with larger nuclei and abundant
acidophilic cytoplasm (Fig. 18.7). These tumours are the
most malignant of the uveal melanomas and have poor
prognosis (35% 10-year survival).
4.
Mixed cell type melanomas have features of spindle
cell type as well as of epithelioid cell type. These are more
common tumours and carry an intermediate prognosis
(45% 10-year survival).
In general, uveal malignant melanomas are usually slow-
growing, late metastasising and have a better prognosis than
malignant melanoma of the skin (Chapter 26). Uveal
melanomas spread via haematogenous route and liver is
eventually involved in 90% of cases. Various indicators of
bad prognosis include large tumour size and epithelioid cell
type.
Retinoblastoma
This is the most common malignant ocular tumour in
children. It may be present at birth or recognised in early
childhood before the age of 4 years. Retinoblastoma has some
peculiar features. About 60% cases of retinoblastoma are
sporadic and the remaining 40% are familial. Familial
tumours are often multiple and multifocal and transmitted
as an autosomal dominant trait by retinoblastoma
susceptibility gene (RB) located on chromosome 13. Such
individuals have a higher incidence of bilateral tumours and
have increased risk of developing second primary tumour,
particularly osteogenic sarcoma. Retinoblastoma may occur

Uveal melanoma. The tumour cells are epithelioid in
appearance having prominent nucleoli and contain black finely granular
melanin pigment in the cytoplasm.

The Eye, ENT and Neck
as a congenital tumour too. Clinically, the child presents with
leukokoria i.e. white pupillary reflex.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour
characteristically appears as a white mass within the retina
which may be partly solid and partly necrotic. The tumour
may be endophytic when it protrudes into the vitreous, or
exophytic when it grows between the retina and the
pigment epithelium (Fig. 18.8).
Microscopically, the tumour is composed of
undifferentiated retinal cells with tendency towards
formation of photo-receptor elements. In the better
differentiated area, the tumour cells are characteristically
arranged in rosettes. The rosettes may be of 2 types—
Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes characterised by small
tumour cells arranged around a lumen with their nuclei
away from the lumen, and Homer-Wright rosettes having
radial arrangement of tumour cells around the central
neurofibrillar structure (Fig. 18.9). The tumour shows
wide areas of necrosis and calcification and dissemination
in all directions—into the vitreous, under the retina, into
the optic nerve and even into the brain.
The tumour can spread widely via haematogenous route
as well. Prognosis is determined by the extent of local
invasion and distant metastasis.
Salient features of retinoblastoma are contrasted with
those of uveal melanoma in Table 18.2.
Metastatic Tumours
Ocular metastatic tumours are far more common than
primary ocular malignant tumours, choroid and iris being
the preferential site for metastasis. Common primary
tumours that metastasise in the eye are cancers of the breast
in women and lung in men. Leukaemia and malignant
lymphoma also commonly invade ocular tissues.
EAR
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The ear is divided into 3 parts—the external, middle and
inner ear.
The external ear comprises the auricle or pinna composed
of cartilage, the external cartilaginous meatus and the
external bony meatus. The external meatus is lined by

Systemic Pathology
stratified epithelium which is continued on to the external
layer of the tympanic membrane. The tympanic membrane
has middle layer of elastic fibrous tissue and the inner layer
of mucous membrane and is supported around the periphery
by the annulus.
The middle ear consists of 3 parts—the uppermost
portion is the attic, the middle portion is mesotympanum, and
the lowermost portion is the hypotympanum. Besides, the
middle ear has an opening, eustachian tube, the mastoid
antrum and cells, and the three ossicles (the malleus, incus
and stapes). The middle ear is lined by a single layer of flat
ciliated and nonciliated epithelium.
The inner ear or labyrinth consists of bony capsule
embedded in the petrous bone and contains the membranous
labyrinth. The bony capsule consists of 3 parts—posteriorly
three semicircular canals, in the middle is the vestibule, and
anteriorly contains snail-like cochlea.
Besides the function of hearing, the stimulation of
vestibular labyrinth can cause vertigo, nausea, vomiting and
nystagmus.
INFLAMMATORY LESIONS
OTITIS MEDIA. This is the term used for inflammatory
involvement of the middle ear. It may be acute or chronic.
The usual source of infection is via the eustachian tube and
the common causative organisms are Streptococcus
pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and β-Streptococcus
haemolyticus. Otitis media may be suppurative, serous or
mucoid. Acute suppurative otitis media (SOM) clinically
presents as tense and hyperaemic tympanic membrane along
with pain and tenderness and sometimes mastoiditis as well.
Chronic SOM manifests clinically as draining ear with
perforated tympanic membrane and partially impaired
hearing. Serous or mucoid otitis media refers to non-
suppurative accumulation of serous or thick viscid fluid in
the middle ear. These collections of fluid are encountered
more often in children causing hearing problems and occur
due to obstruction of the eustachian tube.
RELAPSING POLYCHONDRITIS. This is an uncommon
autoimmune disease characterised by complete loss of
glycosaminoglycans resulting in destruction of cartilage of
the ear, nose, eustachian tube, larynx and lower respiratory
tract.
Histologically, the perichondral areas show acute
inflammatory cell infiltrate and destruction and vasculari-
sation of the cartilage. Late stage shows lymphocytic
infiltration and fibrous replacement.
CHONDRODERMATITIS NODULARIS CHRONICA
HELICIS. This condition involves the external ear
superficially and presents as a ‘painful nodule of the ear’.
The skin in this location is in direct contact with the cartilage
without protective subcutaneous layer.
Histologically, the nodule shows epithelial hyperplasia
with degeneration of the underlying collagen, chronic
inflammatory cell infiltrate, vascular proliferation and
fibrosis.
MISCELLANEOUS CONDITIONS
CAULIFLOWER EAR. This is an acquired deformity of the
external ear due to degeneration of cartilage as a result of
repeated trauma as occurs in boxers and wrestlers.
Histologically, there is destruction of cartilage forming
homogeneous matrix (chondromalacia) and fibrous
replacement.
OTOSCLEROSIS. This is a dystrophic disease of labyrinth
of the temporal bone. The footplate of stapes first undergoes
fibrous replacement and is subsequently replaced by sclerotic
bone. The exact etiology is not known but the condition has
familial preponderance and autosomal dominant trait. It is
seen more commonly in young males as a cause for sensori-
neural type of deafness.
TUMOURS AND TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS
Tumours and tumour-like conditions are relatively more
common in the external than the middle and inner ear. The
lesions seen in the external ear are similar to those seen in
the skin e.g. tumour-like lesions such as epidermal cyst; benign
tumours like naevi and squamous cell papilloma; and
malignant tumours such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous
cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma. However, tumours
and tumour-like lesions which are specific to the ear are
described below. These include the following:
In the external ear—aural (otic) polyps and cerumen-
gland tumours.
In the middle ear—cholesteatoma (keratoma) and jugular
paraganglioma (glomus jugulare tumour).
In the inner ear—acoustic neuroma.
AURAL (OTIC) POLYPS. Aural or otic polyps are tumour-
like lesions arising from the middle ear as a complication of
the chronic otitis media and project into the external auditory
canal.
Histologically, they are composed of chronic inflamma-
tory granulation tissue and are often covered by
metaplastic squamous epithelium or pseudostratified
columnar epithelium.
CERUMEN-GLAND TUMOURS. Tumours arising from
cerumen-secreting apocrine sweat glands of the external
auditory canal are cerumen-gland adenomas or cerumen-
gland adenocarcinomas and are counter-parts of sweat gland
tumours (hideradenoma and adenocarcinoma) of the skin
discussed in Chapter 26. Both these tumours may invade the
temporal bone.
CHOLESTEATOMA (KERATOMA). This is a post-
inflammatory ‘pseudotumour’ found in the middle ear or
mastoid air cells. There is invariable history of acute or
chronic otitis media. A marginal perforation is generally

CHAPTER 18
The Eye, ENT and Neck
present through which the squamous epithelium enters the
middle ear and results in exfoliation of squamous and
formation of the keratin. Rarely, it may be a primary lesion
arising from embryonal rests of squamous epithelium in the
temporal bone.
Histologically, the lesion consists of cyst containing
abundant keratin material admixed with cholesterol
crystals and large number of histiocytes (Fig. 18.10).  In
advanced cases, there may be pressure erosion of the bone.
JUGULAR PARAGANGLIOMA (GLOMUS JUGULARE
TUMOUR, NON-CHROMAFFIN PARAGANGLIOMA).
Tumours originating from parasympathetic ganglia are
called ‘paraganglioma’ and are named according to the
location of the tissue of origin. The one arising from glomus
jugulare bodies of the middle ear (jugulotympanic bodies)
is called jugular paraganglioma or chemodectoma or non-
chromaffin paraganglioma and is the most common benign
tumour of the middle ear. Histologically similar tumours are
seen in the carotid bodies and vagus (Chapter 27).
Microscopically, the tumour cells containing neuro-
secretory granules are arranged in typical organoid
pattern or nests. The tumour may extend locally to involve
the skull and brain but may rarely metastasise.
ACOUSTIC NEUROMA (ACOUSTIC SCHWANNOMA).
This is a tumour of Schwann cells of 8th cranial nerve
(page 893). It is usually located in the internal auditory canal
and cerebellopontine angle. It is a benign tumour similar to
other schwannomas but by virtue of its location and large
size, may produce compression of the important
neighbouring tissues leading to deafness, tinnitus, paralysis
of 5th and 7th nerves, compression of the brainstem and
hydrocephalus.
NOSE AND PARANASAL SINUSES
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The external nose and the septum are composed of bone and
cartilage. On the lateral wall of the nasal cavity, there is a
system of 3 ridges on each side known as conchae or
turbinates—the inferior, middle and superior. The nasal
accessory sinuses are air spaces in the bones of the skull and
communicate with the nasal cavity. They are the frontal air
sinus, maxillary air sinus and the anterior ethmoid air cells,
comprising the anterior group, while posterior ethmoidal cells
and sphenoidal sinus form the posterior group. The anterior
group drains into the middle meatus while the posterior
group drains into the superior meatus and the spheno-
ethmoidal recess. Nasal mucous membranes as well as the
lining of the nasal sinus are lined by respiratory epithelium
(pseudostratified columnar ciliated cells). Mucous and serous
glands underlie the mucous membrane. Besides, the upper
and middle turbinate processes and the upper third of the
septum are covered with olfactory mucous membrane.
The main physiologic functions of the nose are smell,
filtration, humidification and warming of the air being
breathed.
INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS
ACUTE RHINITIS (COMMON COLD). Acute rhinitis or
common cold is the common inflammatory disorder of the
nasal cavities that may extend into the nasal sinuses. It begins
with rhinorrhoea, nasal obstruction and sneezing. Initially,
the nasal discharge is watery, but later it becomes thick and
purulent. The etiologic agents are generally adenoviruses that
evoke catarrhal discharge. Chilling of the body is a
contributory factor. Secondary bacterial invasion is common.
The nasal mucosa is oedematous, red and thickened.
Microscopically, there are numerous neutrophils,
lymphocytes, plasma cells and some eosinophils with
abundant oedema.
ALLERGIC RHINITIS (HAY FEVER). Allergic rhinitis
occurs due to sensitivity to allergens such as pollens. It is an
IgE-mediated immune response consisting of an early acute
response due to degranulation of mast cells, and a delayed
prolonged response in which there is infiltration by
leucocytes such as eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils and
macrophages accompanied with oedema.
SINUSITIS. Acute sinusitis is generally a complication of
acute or allergic rhinitis and rarely secondary to dental sepsis.
The ostia are occluded due to inflammation and oedema and
the sinuses are full. ‘Mucocele’ is filling up of the sinus with
mucus while ‘empyema’ of the sinus occurs due to collection
of pus. Acute sinusitis may become chronic due to incomplete
resolution of acute inflammation and from damage to the
mucous membrane. Sinusitis may rarely spread to produce
osteomyelitis and intracranial infections.
NASAL POLYPS. Nasal polyps are common and are
pedunculated grape-like masses of tissue. They are the end-
Figure 18.10
Cholesteatoma middle ear. There is chronic
inflammatory granulation tissue and foreign body giant cells around the
cholesterol clefts and some pink keratinous material.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
result of prolonged chronic inflammation causing poly-
poid thickening of the mucosa. They may be allergic or inflam-
matory. They are frequently bilateral and the middle turbinate
is the common site. Antrochoanal polyps originate from the
mucosa of the maxillary sinus and appear in the nasal cavity.
Morphologically, nasal and antro-choanal polyps are
identical.
Grossly, they are gelatinous masses with smooth and
shining surface.
Microscopically, they are composed of loose oedematous
connective tissue containing some mucous glands and
varying number of inflammatory cells like lymphocytes,
plasma cells and eosinophils. Allergic polyps have plenty
of eosinophils and hyperplasia of mucous glands. Both
inflammatory and allergic polyps are covered by
respiratory epithelium which may show squamous
metaplasia (Fig. 18.11). Nasal polyps may have
superimposed fungal infection.
RHINOSPORIDIOSIS. Rhinosporidiosis is caused by a
fungus, Rhinosporidium seeberi. Typically it occurs in a nasal
polyp but may be found in other locations like nasopharynx,
larynx and conjunctiva. The disease is common in India and
Sri Lanka and sporadic in other parts of the world.
Microscopically, besides the structure of inflammatory
or allergic polyp, large number of organisms of the size
of erythrocytes with chitinous wall are seen in the thick-
walled sporangia. Each sporangium may contain a few
thousand spores. On rupture of a sporangium, the spores
are discharged into the submucosa or on to the surface of
the mucosa. The intervening tissue consists of inflam-
matory granulation tissue (plasma cells, lymphocytes,
histiocytes, neutrophils) while the overlying epithelium
shows hyperplasia, focal thinning and occasional
ulceration (Fig. 18.12).
RHINOSCLEROMA. This is a chronic destructive
inflammatory lesion of the nose and upper respiratory
airways caused by diplobacilli, Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. The
condition is endemic in parts of Africa, America, South Asia
and Eastern Europe. The condition begins as a common cold
and progresses to atrophic stage, and then into the nodular
stage characterised by small tumour-like submucosal masses.
Histologically, there is extensive infiltration by foamy
histiocytes containing the organisms (Mikulicz cells) and
other chronic inflammatory cells like lymphocytes and
plasma cells.
GRANULOMAS. Many granulomatous inflammations may
involve the nose. These include: tuberculosis, leprosy,
syphilis, aspergillosis, mucormycosis, Wegener’s
granulomatosis and lethal midline granuloma.
Figure 18.11
Allergic polyp nose. The overlying mucosa is covered
partly by respiratory and partly by squamous metaplastic epithelium.
The underlying stroma is oedematous and contains inflammatory cells
with prominence of eosinophils.

infiltrate.

517
CHAPTER 18
The Eye, ENT and Neck
1.
Tuberculosis or lupus of the nose is uncommon and
occurs secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis and usually
produces ulcerative lesions on the anterior part of the septum
of the nose.
2.
Leprosy begins as a nodule that may ulcerate and
perforate the septum.
3.
Syphilis may involve the nose in congenital form causing
destruction of the septum, or in acquired tertiary syphilis in
the form of gummas perforating the septum. In either case,
characteristic saddle-nose deformity occurs due to collapse
of bridge of the nose.
4.
Aspergillosis may involve the paranasal sinuses where
the septate hyphae grow to form a mass called aspergilloma.
5.
Mucormycosis is an opportunistic infection caused by
Mucorales which are non-septate hyphae and involve the
nerves and blood vessels.
6.
Wegener’s granulomatosis is a form of necrotising
vasculitis with granuloma formation affecting the upper
respiratory tract, lungs and kidneys. In 15-50% of cases, the
condition may evolve into malignant lymphoma.
7.
Lethal midline granuloma or polymorphic reticulosis
is a rare and lethal lesion of the upper respiratory tract that
causes extensive destruction of cartilage and necrosis of
tissues and does not respond to antibiotic treatment. Besides
the necrosis, lymphoid infiltrates of pleomorphic and atypical
cells admixed with small lymphocytes, plasma cells and
macrophages are seen. Currently, the condition is considered
to be a T cell lymphoma that may respond to chemotherapy
and radiotherapy (page 380).
TUMOURS
The tumours of nose, nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses are
uncommon. However, benign and malignant tumours of
epithelial as well as mesenchymal origin can occur.
Benign Tumours
1.
CAPILLARY HAEMANGIOMA. Capillary haeman-
gioma of the septum of nose is a common benign lesion. If
the surface is ulcerated and the lesion contains inflammatory
cell infiltrate, it resembles inflammatory granulation tissue
and is called ‘haemangioma of granulation tissue type’ or
‘granuloma pyogenicum’.
2.
SINONASAL PAPILLOMAS. Papillomas may occur in
the nasal vestibule, nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. They
are mainly of 2 types—fungiform papilloma with exophytic
growth, and inverted papilloma with everted growth, also
called Schneiderian pailloma. Each of these may be lined with
various combinations of epithelia: respiratory, squamous and
mucous type.
Malignant Tumours
1. OLFACTORY NEUROBLASTOMA OR ESTHESIO-
NEUROBLASTOMA. It occurs over the olfactory mucosa
as a polypoid mass that may invade the paranasal sinuses
or skull. It is a highly malignant small cell tumour of neural
crest origin that may, at times, be indistinguishable from
other small cell malignancies like rhabdomyosarcoma,
undifferentiated carcinoma, lymphoma or Ewing’s sarcoma.
Rosettes are found in about 10% of tumours.
2. CARCINOMAS. Majority of carcinomas of the nasal cavity
and paranasal sinuses are squamous cell carcinomas,
commonly called sinonasal carcinomas. They are seen more
commonly in the elderly with history of heavy smoking and
severe chronic sinusitis, in nickel refinery workers and in
wood workers. The tumour extends locally to involve the
surrounding bone and soft tissues and also metastasises
widely. Other types of malignancies found uncommonly in
this location are: adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma,
mucoepidermoid carcinoma, small cell carcinoma,
lymphoma and malignant melanoma.
PHARYNX
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The pharynx has 3 parts—the nasopharynx, oropharynx
(pharynx proper) and the laryngopharynx. The whole of
pharynx is lined by stratified squamous epithelium. The
lymphoid tissue of the pharynx is comprised by the tonsils
and adenoids.
INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS
LUDWIG’S ANGINA. This is a severe, acute streptococcal
cellulitis involving the neck, tongue and back of the throat.
The condition was more common in the pre-antibiotic era as
a complication of compound fracture of the mandible and
periapical infection of the molars. The condition often proves
fatal due to glottic oedema, asphyxia and severe toxaemia.
VINCENT’S ANGINA. Vincent’s angina is a painful
condition of the throat characterised by local ulceration of
the tonsils, mouth and pharynx. The causative organism is
Vincent’s bacillus. The condition may occur as an acute illness
involving the tissues diffusely, or as chronic form consisting
of ulceration of the tonsils.
DIPHTHERIA. Diphtheria is an acute communicable disease
caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. It usually occurs in
children and results in the formation of a yellowish-grey
pseudomembrane in the mucosa of nasopharynx, oropharynx,
tonsils, larynx and trachea. C. diphtheriae elaborates an
exotoxin that causes necrosis of the epithelium which is
associated with abundant fibrinopurulent exudate resulting
in the formation of pseudomembrane. Absorption of the
exotoxin in the blood may lead to more distant injurious
effects such as myocardial necrosis, polyneuritis,
parenchymal necrosis of the liver, kidney and adrenals. The
constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, malaise,
obstruction of the airways and dyspnoea are quite marked.
The condition has to be distinguished from the membrane
of streptococcal infection.
TONSILLITIS. Tonsillitis caused by staphylococci or
streptococci may be acute or chronic. Acute tonsillitis is charac-
terised by enlargement, redness and inflammation. Acute
tonsillitis may progress to acute follicular tonsillitis in which

518
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
crypts are filled with debris and pus giving it follicular
appearance. Chronic tonsillitis is caused by repeated attacks
of acute tonsillitis in which case the tonsils are small and
fibrosed. Acute tonsillitis may pass on to tissues adjacent to
tonsils to form peritonsillar abscess or quinsy.
PERITONSILLAR ABSCESS (QUINSY). Peritonsillar
abscess or quinsy occurs as a complication of acute tonsil-
litis. The causative organisms are staphylococci or
streptococci which are associated with infection of the tonsils.
The patient complains of acute pain in the throat, trismus,
difficulty in speech and inability to swallow. The glands
behind the angle of the mandible are enlarged and tender.
Besides the surgical management of the abscess, the patient
must be advised  tonsillectomy because quinsy is frequently
recurrent.
RETROPHARYNGEAL ABSCESS. Formation of abscess in
the soft tissue between the posterior wall of the pharynx and
the vertebral column is called retropharyngeal abscess. It
occurs due to infection of the retropharyngeal lymph nodes.
It is found in debilitated children. A chronic form of the
abscess in the same location is seen in tuberculosis of the
cervical spine (cold abscess).
TUMOURS
There are 4 main tumours of note in the pharynx, one
benign—nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, and three
malignant— nasopharyngeal carcinoma,  embryonal
rhabdomyosarcoma and malignant lymphoma.
NASOPHARYNGEAL ANGIOFIBROMA. This is a
peculiar tumour that occurs exclusively in adolescent males
(10-20 years of age) suggesting the role of testosterone
hormone in its production. Though a benign tumour of the
nasopharynx, it may grow into paranasal sinuses, cheek and
orbit but does not metastasise.
Microscopically, the tumour is composed of 2 components
as the name suggests—numerous small endothelium-
lined vascular spaces and the stromal cells which are
myofibroblasts (Fig. 18.13). The androgen-dependence of
the tumour is confirmed by demonstration by
immunostaining for androgen receptors in 75% cases.
NASOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMA. Nasopharyngeal
carcinoma is a common cancer in South-East Asia, especially
prevalent in people of Chinese descent under 45 years of age.
Genetic susceptibility and role of Epstein-Barr virus are consi-
dered important factors in its etiology (page 225). In fact,
EBV-genome is found virtually in all cases of nasopharyngeal
carcinoma. The primary tumour is generally small and
undetected, while the metastatic deposits in the cervical
lymph nodes may be large.
Microscopically, nasopharyngeal carcinoma has
3 histologic variants:
i)
Non-keratinising squamous cell carcinoma
ii) Keratinising squamous cell carcinoma
iii) Undifferentiated (transitional cell) carcinoma
Non-keratinising and keratinising squamous cell
carcinomas are identical in morphology to typical tumours
in other locations. The undifferentiated carcinoma, also
called as transitional cell carcinoma, is characterised by
masses and cords of cells which are polygonal to spindled
and have large vesicular nuclei. A variant of undiffe-
rentiated carcinoma is ‘lymphoepithelioma’ in which
undifferentiated carcinoma is infiltrated by abundant non-
neoplastic mature lymphocytes (Fig. 18.14).
Figure 18.13
Angiofibroma nose. There is admixture of thin-walled
blood vessels and spindled stroma. The blood vessels are variable-sized,
some having incomplete muscle coat and there is absence of elastic
tissue.  The stroma has stellate fibroblasts and mast cells.

tumour is composed of undifferentiated anaplastic cells arranged in nests.

519
CHAPTER 18
The Eye, ENT and Neck
The prognosis is usually fatal. Undifferentiated
carcinoma is radiosensitive.
EMBRYONAL RHABDOMYOSARCOMA. Also termed as
botyroid rhabdomyosarcoma, this is one of the common
malignant tumours in children but can also occur in adults.
The lesion is highly cellular and mitotically active. Other
locations include vagina, orbit, middle ear, oral cavity,
retroperitoneum and bile duct. It is discussed in detail on
page 867.
MALIGNANT LYMPHOMA. The lymphoid tissue of the
nasopharynx and tonsils may be the site for development of
malignant lymphomas which resemble similar tumours
elsewhere in the body.
LARYNX
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The larynx is composed of cartilages which are bound
together by ligaments and muscles and is covered by mucous
membrane. The cartilages of the larynx are of 2 types—
unpaired and paired.
The unpaired laryngeal cartilages are epiglottis, thyroid
cartilage (Adam’s apple) and cricoid cartilage.
The paired cartilages are the arytenoid cartilages which
play important part in the movement of vocal cords.
The larynx as well as trachea are lined by respiratory
epithelium, except over the true vocal cords and the
epiglottis, which are lined by stratified squamous epithelium.
INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS
ACUTE LARYNGITIS. This may occur as a part of the
upper or lower respiratory tract infection. Atmospheric
pollutants like cigarette smoke, exhaust fumes, industrial
and domestic smoke etc predispose the larynx to acute
bacterial and viral infections. Streptococci and H. influenzae
cause acute epiglottitis which may be life-threatening. Acute
laryngitis may occur in some other illnesses like typhoid,
measles and influenza. Acute pseudomembranous
(diphtheric) laryngitis occurs due to infection with C.
diphtheriae.
CHRONIC LARYNGITIS. Chronic laryngitis may occur
from repeated attacks of acute inflammation, excessive
smoking, chronic alcoholism or vocal abuse. The surface is
granular due to swollen mucous glands. There may be
extensive squamous metaplasia due to heavy smoking,
chronic bronchitis and atmospheric pollution.
TUBERCULOUS LARYNGITIS. Tuberculous laryngitis
occurs secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis. Typical
caseating tubercles are present on the surface of the larynx.
ACUTE OEDEMA OF THE LARYNX. This hazardous
condition is an acute inflammatory condition, causing
swelling of the larynx that may lead to airway obstruction
and death by suffocation. Acute laryngeal oedema may occur
due to trauma, inhalation of irritants, drinking hot fluids or
may be infective in origin.
TUMOURS
Both benign and malignant tumours occur in the larynx. The
common examples of benign tumours are papillomas and
polyps, while laryngeal carcinoma is an important example
amongst malignant tumours.
LARYNGEAL PAPILLOMA AND PAPILLOMATOSIS.
Juvenile laryngeal papillomas are found in children or
adolescents and are often multiple, while the adults have
usually a single lesion. Multiple juvenile papillomas may
undergo spontaneous regression at puberty. Human
papilloma virus (HPV type 11 and 6) has been implicated in
the etiology of papillomas of the larynx.
Grossly, the lesions appear as warty growths on the true
vocal cords, epiglottis and sometimes extend to the trachea
and bronchi.
Microscopically, papillomas are composed of finger-like
papillae, each papilla contains fibrovascular core covered
by stratified squamous epithelium (Fig. 18.15).
LARYNGEAL NODULES. Laryngeal nodules or polyps are
seen mainly in adults and are found more often in heavy
smokers and in individuals subjected to vocal abuse.
Therefore, they are known by various synonyms like singers’
nodes, preachers’ node, and screamers’ nodes. The patients
have characteristic progressive hoarseness.
Grossly, it is a small lesion, less than 1 cm in diameter,
rounded, smooth, usually sessile and polypoid swelling
on the true vocal cords.
Microscopically, the nodules have prominent oedema
with sparse fibrous tissue and numerous irregular and
Figure 18.15
Squamous cell papilloma. There is papillomatosis;
papillae are covered with well oriented and orderly layers of squamous
cells.

520
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
dilated vascular channels. Sometimes, the subepithelial
basement membrane is thickened, resembling amyloid
material (Fig. 18.16).
LARYNGEAL CARCINOMA. Cancer of the larynx in 99%
of cases is squamous cell carcinoma. Rarely, adenocarcinoma
and sarcoma are encountered. Squamous carcinoma of the
larynx occurs in males beyond 4th decade of life. Important
etiologic factor is heavy smoking of cigarettes, cigar or pipe;
other factors include excessive alcohol consumption,
radiation and asbestos exposure. Carcinoma of the larynx is
conventionally classified into extrinsic that arises or extends
outside the larynx, and intrinsic that arises within the larynx.
However, based on the anatomic location, laryngeal
carcinoma is classified as under:
1.
Glottic is the most common location, found in the region
of true vocal cords and anterior and posterior commissures.
2.
Supraglottic involving ventricles and arytenoids.
3.
Subglottic in the walls of subglottis.
4.
Marginal zone between the tip of epiglottis and ary-
epiglottic folds.
5.
Laryngo-(hypo-) pharynx in the pyriform fossa, postcricoid
fossa and posterior pharyngeal wall.
Grossly, the glottic carcinoma is the most common form
and appears as a small, pearly white, plaque-like
thickening that may be ulcerated or fungated.
Microscopically, keratinising and non-keratinising
squamous carcinomas of varying grades are found.
Generally, carcinoma of the supraglottic and subglottic
regions tends to be more poorly-differentiated than the
glottic tumour. Besides the keratinising and non-
keratinising squamous carcinoma, 2 special varieties of
squamous carcinoma in the larynx are: verrucous carcinoma
(or Ackerman’s tumour) which is a variant of well-
differentiated squamous carcinoma, and spindle cell
carcinoma which has elongated tumour cells resembling
sarcoma (pseudosarcoma) at the other extreme of
prognosis.
Cervical lymph node metastasis of laryngeal carcinoma
are found in a good proportion of cases at the time of
diagnosis. Death from laryngeal cancer occurs due to local
extension of growth into vital structures like trachea and
carotid artery; other causes are bacterial infection, aspiration
pneumonia, debility and disseminated metastases.
NECK
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The neck is the region from where important structures like
oesophagus, trachea, carotid arteries, great veins and nerve
trunks pass down. Besides, the neck has structures such as
carotid body, sympathetic ganglia, larynx, thyroid,
parathyroids and lymph nodes. Only the tumours and cysts
of the neck are considered here while the lesions pertaining
to other anatomic structures are described elsewhere in the
textbook.
CYSTS OF NECK
The cysts of neck may be medial (midline) or lateral
(Table 18.3).
Medial (Midline) Cervical Cysts
THYROGLOSSAL CYST. Thyroglossal cyst arises from the
vestiges of thyroglossal duct that connects the foramen
caecum at the base of the tongue with the normally located
thyroid gland. The cyst is located in the midline, generally
at the level of hyoid bone, and rarely at the base of the tongue.
Microscopically, the cyst is lined by respiratory and/or
stratified squamous epithelium.
MIDLINE DERMOID CYST. Dermoid cyst located in the
midline of the neck occurs due to sequestration of dermal
cells along the lines of closure of embryonic clefts. The cyst
contains paste-like pultaceous material.
Microscopically, it is lined by epidermis and may contain
skin adnexal structures.
Lateral Cervical Cysts
BRANCHIAL (LYMPHOEPITHELIAL) CYST. Branchial or
lymphoepithelial cyst arises from incomplete closure of 2nd
Figure 18.16
Laryngeal nodule. The lesion has intact surface
epithelium. The subepithelium has fibromyxoid appearance and contains
proliferating blood vessels some of which are hyalinised.

CHAPTER 18
The Eye, ENT and Neck
or 3rd branchial clefts. The cyst is generally located anterior
to the sternocleidomastoid muscle near the angle of the
mandible. The cyst is 1-3 cm in diameter and is filled with
serous or mucoid material.
Microscopically, the cyst is lined by stratified squamous
or respiratory epithelium, covering subepithelial
lymphoid tissue aggregates or follicles with germinal
centres.
PARATHYROID CYST. Parathyroid cyst is a lateral cyst of
the neck usually located deep to the sternocleidomastoid
muscle at the angle of the mandible. These may be
microscopic cysts or larger. They are generally thin-walled,
filled with clear watery fluid.
Microscopically, parathyroid cyst is lined by flattened
cuboidal to low columnar epithelium and the cyst wall
may contain any type of parathyroid cells.
CERVICAL THYMIC CYST. Cervical thymic cyst originates
from cystic degeneration of Hassall’s corpuscles. It is
generally located in the left lateral side of the neck.
Microscopically, the cyst is lined by stratified squamous
epithelium and the cyst wall may contain thymic
structures.
CYSTIC HYGROMA. Cystic hygroma is a lateral swelling
at the root of the neck, usually located behind the
sternocleidomastoid muscle. It may be present congenitally
or may manifest in the first 2 years of life. It is usually
multilocular and may extend into the mediastinum and
pectoral region.
Microscopically, cystic hygroma is a diffuse lymphan-
gioma containing large cavernous spaces lined by
endothelium and containing lymph fluid (page 412).
TUMOURS
Tumours of the neck may be primary or metastatic in cervical
lymph nodes.
Primary Tumours
A few important examples of primary tumours in the neck
are carotid body tumour, torticollis and malignant
lymphomas.
CAROTID BODY TUMOUR (CHEMODECTOMA,
CAROTID BODY PARAGANGLIOMA). Carotid body
tumour arises in the carotid bodies which are situated at the
bifurcation of the common carotid arteries. Carotid bodies
are normally part of the chemoreceptor system and the cells
of this system are sensitive to changes in the pH and arterial
oxygen tension and are also the storage site for catechola-
mines. Histologically similar tumours are found in other
parasympathetic ganglia represented by the vagus and
glomus jugulare (jugulotympanic bodies, Chapter 27).
Carotid body paragangliomas, as they are currently called,
are rare tumours and occur between 3rd and 6th decades of
life with slight female preponderance. A few (5%) are bilateral
and some show familial incidence.
Grossly, they are small, firm, dark tan, encapsulated
nodules.
Microscopically, well-differentiated tumour cells form
characteristic organoid or alveolar pattern, as is the case
with all other neuroendocrine tumours. The tumour cells
contain dark neurosecretory granules containing
catecholamines.
These tumours are mostly benign but recurrences are
frequent; about 10% may metastasise widely.
TORTICOLLIS (FIBROMATOSIS COLLI, WRY NECK).
This is a deformity in which the head is bent to one side while
the chin points to the other side. The deformity may occur as
congenital torticollis or may be an acquired form. The acquired
form may occur secondary to fracture dislocation of the
cervical spine, Pott’s disease of the cervical spine, scoliosis,
spasm of the muscles of neck, exposure to chill causing
myositis, and contracture following burns or wound healing.
The congenital or primary torticollis appears at birth or within
the first few weeks of life as a firm swelling in the lower
third of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The etiology is
unknown but about half the cases are associated with breech
delivery.
Grossly, the muscle is contracted, shortened and fibrous.
Microscopically, abundant dense fibrous tissue separates
the muscle fibres.
MALIGNANT LYMPHOMAS. Various forms of non-
Hodgkin’s lymphomas and Hodgkin’s disease occur in the
cervical lymph nodes which are described in Chapter 14.
Secondary Tumours
Cervical lymph nodes are common site for metastases of a
large number of carcinomas. These include: squamous cell
carcinoma of the lips, mouth, tongue, larynx and oesophagus;
transitional cell carcinoma of the pharynx and nasopharynx;
thoracic and abdominal cancers such as of the stomach, lungs,
ovaries, uterus and testis.

The Oral Cavity and
Salivary Glands

Chapter 19
ORAL SOFT TISSUES
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The oral cavity is the point of entry for digestive and
respiratory tracts. The mucous membrane of the mouth
consists of squamous epithelium covering vascularised
connective tissue. The epithelium is keratinised over the hard
palate, lips and gingiva, while elsewhere it is non-keratinised.
Mucous glands (minor salivary glands) are scattered
throughout the oral mucosa. Sebaceous glands are present
in the region of the lips and the buccal mucosa only.
Lymphoid tissue is present in the form of tonsils and
adenoids.
The oral cavity is the site of numerous congenital and
acquired diseases. Besides, many systemic diseases have oral
manifestations. Some of the commonly occurring conditions
are discussed here.
DEVELOPMENTAL ANOMALIES
1.
FACIAL CLEFTS. Cleft upper lip (harelip) and cleft palate,
alone or in combination, are the commonest developmental
anomalies of the face. These occur from the failure of fusion
of facial processes.
2.
FORDYCE’S GRANULES. Fordyce’s granules are
symmetric, small, light yellow macular spots on the lips and
buccal mucosa and represent collections of sebaceous glands.
They remain undeveloped until puberty but occur quite
commonly in adults.
3.
LEUKOEDEMA. This is an asymptomatic condition
occurring in children and is characterised by symmetric, grey-
white areas on the buccal mucosa. Histologically, there is
pronounced intracellular oedema. There is no increased
malignant potential compared to leukoplakia discussed
below.
4.
DEVELOPMENTAL DEFECTS OF THE TONGUE.
These are as under:
i)
Macroglossia is the enlargement of the tongue, usually
due to lymphangioma or haemangioma, and sometimes due
to amyloid tumour.
ii) Microglossia and aglossia are rare congenital anomalies
representing small-sized and absence of tongue respectively.
iii) Fissured tongue (scrotal, furrowed or grooved tongue)
is a genetically-determined condition characterised by
numerous small furrows or grooves on the dorsum of the
tongue. It is often associated with mild glossitis.
iv) Bifid tongue is a rare condition occurring due to failure
of the two lateral halves of the tongue to fuse in the midline.
v) Tongue tie occurs when the lingual fraenum is quite
short, or when the fraenum is attached near the tongue tip.
vi) Hairy tongue is not a true developmental defect, but is
mentioned here because of its similarity  with other
conditions discussed here. The filiform papillae are
hypertrophied and elongated. These ‘hairs’ (papillae) are
stained black, brown or yellowish-white by food, tobacco,
oxidising agents or by oral flora.
MUCOCUTANEOUS LESIONS
Lesions of the oral mucosa occur in many diseases of the
skin (Chapter 26) and they are similar in morphology. Some
of these are listed as under:
LICHEN PLANUS. Characteristically, oral lichen planus
appears as interlacing network of whitening or keratosis on
the buccal mucosa but other oral tissues such as gingival,
tongue and palate may also be involved.
VESICULAR LESIONS. A number of vesicular or bullous
diseases of the skin have oral lesions.
i)
Pemphigus vulgaris. Vesicular oral lesions appear
invariably in all cases at some time in the course of
pemphigus vulgaris. In about half the cases oral lesions are
the initial manifestations.
ii) Pemphigoid. Vesicles or bullae appear on oral mucosa
as well as on conjunctiva in pemphigoid and are seen more
often in older women.
iii) Erythema multiforme. Subepithelial vesicles may occur
on the skin as well as mucosae.
iv) Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a rather fatal and severe
form of erythema multiforme involving oral and other
mucous membranes occurring following ingestion of sulfa
drugs.
v) Epidermolysis bullosa is a hereditary condition having
subepidermal bullae on the skin as well as has oral lesions.
INFLAMMATORY DISEASES
STOMATITIS. Inflammation of the mucous membrane of
the mouth is called stomatitis. It can occur in the course of
several different diseases.
i)
Aphthous ulcers (Canker sores) is the commonest form
of oral ulceration. The etiology is unknown but may be
precipitated by emotional factors, stress, allergy, hormonal
imbalance, nutritional deficiencies, gastrointestinal

523
CHAPTER 19
The Oral Cavity and Salivary Glands
disturbances, trauma etc. The condition is characterised by
painful oral ulcers, 1 cm or more in size. Recurrent aphthae
may form a part of Behcet’s syndrome and inflammatory
bowel disease.
ii) Herpetic stomatitis is an acute disease occurring in
infants and young children. It is the most common
manifestation of primary infection with herpes simplex virus.
The lesions are in the form of vesicles around the lips. Similar
lesions may appear on the genital skin. Recurrent attacks
occur due to stress, emotional upsets and upper respiratory
infections.
iii) Necrotising stomatitis (Noma or Cancrum oris) occurs
more commonly in poorly-nourished children like in
kwashiorkor; infectious diseases such as measles, immuno-
deficiencies and emotional stress. The lesions are
characterised by necrosis of the marginal gingiva and may
extend on to oral mucosa, causing cellulitis of the tissue of
the cheek. The condition may progress to gangrene of the
cheek.
iv) Mycotic infections commonly involving the oral mucosa
are actinomycosis and candidiasis.
Cervicofacial actinomycosis is the commonest form of the
disease developing at the angle of the mandible (Chapter 6).
Candidiasis (moniliasis or thrush) is caused by Candida
albicans which is a commensal in the mouth. It appears as an
opportunistic infection in immunocompromised host. There
are erythematous lesions on the palate and angular cheilitis.
GLOSSITIS. Acute glossitis characterised by swollen
papillae occurs in eruptions of measles and scarlet fever. In
chronic glossitis, the tongue is raw and red without swollen
papillae and is seen in malnutrition such as in pellagra,
ariboflavinosis and niacin deficiency. In iron deficiency
anaemia, pernicious anaemia and sprue, there is chronic
atrophic glossitis characterised by atrophied papillae and
smooth raw tongue.
SYPHILITIC LESIONS. Oral lesions may occur in primary,
secondary, tertiary and congenital syphilis (Chapter 6).
i)
Extragenital chancre of primary syphilis occurs most
commonly on the lips.
ii) Secondary syphilis shows maculopapular eruptions and
mucous patches in the mouth.
iii) In the tertiary syphilis, gummas or diffuse fibrosis may be
seen on the hard palate and tongue.
iv) Oral lesions of the congenital syphilis are fissures at the
angles of mouth and characteristic peg-shaped notched
Hutchinson’s incisors.
TUBERCULOUS LESIONS. Involvement of the mouth in
tuberculosis is rare. The lesions are in the form of ulcers or
elevated nodules.
HIV INFECTION. HIV infection of low grade as well as full-
blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are
associated with oral manifestations such as opportunistic
infections, malignancy, hairy leukoplakia and others; these
are listed in Table 19.1. About half the cases of Kaposi’s
sarcoma have intraoral lesions as part of systemic
involvement (Chapter 6).
PIGMENTARY LESIONS
Oral and labial melanotic pigmentation may be observed in
certain systemic and metabolic disorders such as Addison’s
disease, Albright syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and
haemochromatosis. All types of pigmented naevi as well as
malignant melanoma can occur in oral cavity. Exogenous
pigmentation such as due to deposition of lead sulfide can
also occur.
TUMOURS AND TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS
Benign and malignant tumours as also a number of tumour-
like lesions and premalignant lesions are encountered in the
oral soft tissues. A list of such lesions is presented in

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
A. TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS
A number of proliferative lesions arising from the oral tissues
are tumour-like masses which clinically may resemble
neoplasms. Some of these are as under:
FIBROUS GROWTHS. Fibrous growths of the oral soft
tissues are very common. These are not true tumours (unlike
intraoral fibroma and papilloma), but are instead
inflammatory or irritative in origin. A few common varieties
are as under:
i)
Fibroepithelial polyps occur due to irritation or chronic
trauma. These are composed of reparative fibrous tissue,
covered by a thin layer of stratified squamous epithelium.
ii) Fibrous epulis is a lesion occurring on the gingiva and is
localised hyperplasia of the connective tissue following
trauma or inflammation in the area (Fig. 19.1).  Giant cell epulis
is a variant seen more commonly in females as reactive
change to trauma; the lesion shows numerous osteoclast-like
giant cells and vascular stroma.
iii) Denture hyperplasia occurs in edentulous or partly
edentulous patients. The lesion is an inflammatory
hyperplasia in response to local irritation by ill-fitting denture
or an elongated tooth.
PYOGENIC GRANULOMA. This is an elevated, bright red
swelling of variable size occurring on the lips, tongue, buccal
mucosa and gingiva. It is a vasoproliferative inflammatory
lesion. Pregnancy tumour is a variant of pyogenic granuloma.
MUCOCELE. Also called mucous cyst or retention cyst, it is
a cystic dilatation of the mucous glands of the oral mucosa.
The cyst often ruptures on distension and incites inflam-
matory reaction due to mucous extravasation (Fig. 19.2).
RANULA. It is a large mucocele located on the floor of the
mouth. The cyst is lined by true epithelial lining.
DERMOID CYST. This tumour-like mass in the floor of the
mouth represents a developmental malformation. The cyst
is lined by stratified squamous epithelium. The cyst wall
contains sebaceous glands, sweat glands, hair follicles and
other mature tissues.
B. BENIGN TUMOURS
Different parts of the mouth have a variety of mesodermal
tissues and keratinising and non-keratinising epithelium.
Therefore, majority of neoplasms arising from the oral tissues
are just like their counterparts in other parts of the body.
Some of the common benign tumours of the mouth are as
under:
SQUAMOUS PAPILLOMA. Papilloma can occur anywhere
in the mouth and has the usual papillary or finger-like
projections.
Microscopically, each papilla is composed of vascularised
connective tissue covered by squamous epithelium.
HAEMANGIOMA. Haemangioma can occur anywhere in
the mouth; when it occurs on the tongue it may cause
macroglossia. It is most commonly capillary type, although
cavernous and mixed types may also occur.
LYMPHANGIOMA. Lymphangioma may develop most
commonly on the tongue producing macroglossia; on the lips
producing macrocheilia, and on the cheek. Cystic hygroma
is a special variety of lymphangioma occurring in children
on the lateral side of neck.
Microscopically, lymphangioma is characterised by large
lymphatic spaces lined by endothelium and containing
lymph (Chapter 15).
FIBROMA. Although most common benign oral mucous
membrane mass is fibroma appearing as a discrete superficial
pedunculated mass, it appears to be nonneoplastic in nature.
It probably arises as a response physical trauma (discussed
above).

Figure 19.2
Mucous retention cyst (mucocele). There is inflamma-
tory reaction around extravasated mucus.

525
CHAPTER 19
The Oral Cavity and Salivary Glands
Microscopically, fibroma is composed of collagenic
fibrous connective tissue covered by stratified squamous
epithelium.
FIBROMATOSIS GINGIVAE. This is a fibrous overgrowth
of unknown etiology involving the entire gingiva. Sometimes
the fibrous overgrowth is so much that the teeth are covered
by fibrous tissue.
TUMOURS OF MINOR SALIVARY GLANDS. Minor
salivary glands present in the oral cavity may sometimes be
the site of origin of salivary tumours similar to those seen in
the major salivary glands (page 533). Pleomorphic adenoma
is a common example.
GRANULAR CELL TUMOUR. Earlier called as granular cell
myoblastoma, it is benign tumour which now by electron
microscopic studies is known to be mesenchymal in origin
than odontogenic. The most common location is the tongue
but may occur in any other location on the oral cavity. It
occurs exclusively in females. A similar lesion seen in infants
is termed as congenital epulis.
Microscopically, the tumour is composed of large
polyhedral cells with granular, acidophilic cytoplasm. The
covering epithelium usually shows pronounced
pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia.
OTHER RARE BENIGN TUMOURS. Some other rare
benign tumours which can occur in the oral soft tissues are:
neurilemmoma, neurofibroma, lipoma, giant cell granuloma,
rhabdomyoma, leiomyoma, solitary plasmacytoma, osteoma,
chondroma, naevi and vascular oral lesions seen in hereditary
haemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Rendu-Weber syndrome)
and encephalofacial angiomatosis (Sturge-Weber syndrome).
C. ORAL LEUKOPLAKIA (WHITE LESIONS)
DEFINITION. Leukoplakia (white plaque) may be clinically
defined as a white patch or plaque on the oral mucosa,
exceeding 5 mm in diameter, which cannot be rubbed off
nor can be classified into any other diagnosable disease. A
number of other lesions are characterised by the formation
of white patches listed in Table 19.3. However, from the
pathologist’s point of view, the term ‘leukoplakia’ is reserved
for epithelial thickening which may range from completely
benign to atypical and to premalignant cellular changes.
INCIDENCE. It occurs more frequently in males than
females. The lesions may be of variable size and appearance.
The sites of predilection, in descending order of frequency,
are: cheek mucosa, angles of mouth, alveolar mucosa, tongue,
lip, hard and soft palate, and floor of the mouth. In about 4-
6% cases of leukoplakia, carcinomatous change is reported.
However, it is difficult to decide which white lesions may
undergo malignant transformation, but speckled or nodular
form is more likely to progress to malignancy. Therefore, it
is desirable that all oral white patches be biopsied to exclude
malignancy.
ETIOLOGY. The etiological factors are similar to those
suggested for carcinoma of the oral mucosa (discussed
below). It has the strongest association with the use of tobacco in
various forms, e.g. in heavy smokers (especially in pipe and
cigar smokers) and improves when smoking is discontinued,
and in those who chew tobacco as in paan, paan masaala,
zarda, gutka etc. The condition is also known by other names
such as smokers keratosis and stomatitis nicotina. Other
etiological factors implicated are chronic friction such as with
ill-fitting dentures or jagged teeth, and local irritants like
excessive consumption of alcohol and very hot and spicy
foods and beverages. A special variety of leukoplakia called
‘hairy leukoplakia’ has been described in patients of AIDS and
has hairy or corrugated surface but is not related to
development of oral cancer.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the lesions of
leukoplakia may appear white, whitish-yellow, or red-
velvety of more than 5 mm diameter and variable in
appearance. They are usually circumscribed, slightly
elevated, smooth or wrinkled, speckled or nodular.
Histologically, leukoplakia is of 2 types:
1.
Hyperkeratotic type. This is characterised by an
orderly and regular hyperplasia of squamous epithelium
with hyperkeratosis on the surface (Fig. 19.3, A).
2.
Dysplastic type. When the changes such as irregular
stratification of the epithelium, focal areas of increased
and abnormal mitotic figures, hyperchromatism,
pleomorphism, loss of polarity and individual cell
keratinisation are present, the lesion is considered as
epithelial dysplasia. The subepithelial tissues usually
show an inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes
and plasma cells. The extent and degree of the epithelial
changes indicate the degree of severity of the epithelial
dysplasia. Usually, mild dysplasia may revert back to
normal if the offending etiologic factor is removed,
whereas severe dysplasia indicates that the case may
progress to carcinoma. Erythroplasia is a form of dysplastic
leukoplakia in which the epithelial atypia is more marked
and thus has higher risk of developing malignancy. If the
epithelial dysplasia is extensive so as to involve the entire
thickness of the epithelium, the lesion is called carcinoma
in situ which may progress to invasive carcinoma
(Fig. 19.3, B).

D. MALIGNANT TUMOURS
Squamous Cell (Epidermoid) Carcinoma
Oral cancer is a disease with very poor prognosis because it
is not recognised and treated when small and early.
INCIDENCE. Squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma
comprises 90% of all oral malignant tumours and 5% of all
human malignancies. The peak incidence in the UK and the
USA is from 55 to 75 years of age, whereas in India it is from
40 to 45 years of age. Oral cancer is a very frequent
malignancy in India, Sri Lanka and some Eastern countries,
probably related to habits of betel-nut chewing and reversed
smoking (Chapter 8). There is a definite male preponderance.
It can occur anywhere in the mouth but certain sites are more
commonly involved. These sites, in descending order of
frequency, are: the lips (more commonly lower), tongue,
anterior floor of mouth, buccal mucosa in the region of
alveolar lingual sulcus, and palate (Fig. 19.4).
ETIOLOGY. As with other forms of cancer, the etiology of
squamous cell carcinoma is unknown. But a number of
etiological factors have been implicated:
Strong association:
i)
Tobacco smoking and tobacco chewing causing
leukoplakia is the most important factor as discussed above.
ii) Chronic alcohol consumption.
iii) Human papilloma virus infection, particularly HPV 16,
18 and 33 types.
Weak association:
i)
Chronic irritation from ill-fitting denture or jagged teeth.
ii) Submucosal fibrosis as seen in Indians consuming excess
of chillies.
iii) Poor orodental hygiene.
iv) Nutritional deficiencies.
v) Exposure to sunlight (in relation to lip cancer).
vi) Exposure to radiation.
vii) Plummer-Vinson syndrome, characterised by atrophy of
the upper alimentary tract.
The most common molecular alterations in oncogenes
seen in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity are in  p16,
p53, cyclin D, p63, PTEN, and EGFR.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, squamous cell
carcinoma of oral cavity may have the following types
(Fig. 19.5):
Figure 19.3
Leukoplakia oral mucosa. A,  Hyperkeratosis type. There is keratosis and orderly arrangement of increased number of layers of
stratified mucosa.  B, Dysplastic type. The number of layers is increased and the individual cells in layers show features of cytologic atypia and
mitosis but there is no invasion across the basement membrane.
Figure 19.4

in the oral cavity.

527
CHAPTER 19
The Oral Cavity and Salivary Glands
i)
Ulcerative type—is the most frequent type and is
characterised by indurated ulcer and firm everted or rolled
edges.
ii) Papillary or verrucous type—is soft and wart-like
growth.
iii) Nodular type—appears as a firm, slow growing
submucosal nodule.
iv) Scirrhous type—is characterised by infiltration into
deeper structures.
All these types may appear on a background of
leukoplakia or erythroplasia of the oral mucosa. Enlarged
cervical lymph nodes may sometimes be present.
Histologically, squamous cell carcinoma ranges from
well-differentiated keratinising carcinoma to highly-
undifferentiated neoplasm (Chapter 26). Changes of
epithelial dysplasia are often present in the surrounding
areas of the lesion. Carcinoma of the lip and intraoral
squamous carcinoma are usually always well-
differentiated (Fig. 19.6).
Carcinoma of the lip has a more favourable prognosis
due to visible and easily accessible location and less frequent
metastasis to the regional lymph nodes. However, intraoral
squamous carcinomas have poor prognosis because they are
detected late and metastasis to regional lymph nodes occur
early, especially in the case of carcinoma of tongue and soft
palate. Verrucous carcinoma, on the other hand, is composed
of very well-differentiated squamous epithelium with
minimal atypia and hence has very good prognosis.
OTHER MALIGNANT TUMOURS
Other less common malignant neoplasms which may be
encountered in the oral cavity are: malignant melanoma,
lymphoepithelial carcinoma, malignant lymphoma,
malignant tumours of minor salivary glands, and various
sarcomas like rhabdomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, alveolar soft
part sarcoma, Kaposi’s sarcoma and fibrosarcoma. Metastatic
tumours can also occur in the soft tissues of the mouth.
TEETH AND PERIODONTAL TISSUES
Although care of the teeth belongs to the field of dental
profession, the fully educated medical doctor should be
familiar with certain principal diseases of teeth and
periodontal tissues, especially about dental caries, periapical
abscess and periodontitis, and common cysts and
odontogenic tumours of the jaw. But first, a brief account of
normal structure of these tissues is presented.
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The teeth are normally composed of 3 calcified tissues,
namely: enamel, dentin and cementum; and the pulp which is
composed of connective tissue. The teeth are peculiar than
other calcified tissues of the body by being surrounded by
Figure 19.5

528
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
the portion of oral mucosa called the gingiva or gum, and
that they are part of a highly specialised odontogenic
apparatus; other parts of this apparatus being the mandible
and maxilla.
Embryologically, odontogenic development takes place
from primitive structure, the dental lamina or primitive oral
cavity, as follows:
Inner epithelial layer of the dental lamina is ectoderm-
derived columnar to cuboidal oral epithelium called
ameloblasts which secrete enamel matrix, also called enamel
organ.
Mesoderm-derived connective tissue gives rise to
structures in the dental papilla (i.e. dental pulp or core of
loose connective tissue, blood vessels and nerves).
Outer margin of the dental papilla differentiates into
odontoblasts, which continue with ameloblastsic epithelium;
odontoblasts secrete dentin.
The normal structure of tooth in an adult is as follows
(Fig. 19.7):
Enamel is the outer covering of teeth composed almost
entirely of inorganic material (as in bone) which can be
demonstrated in ground sections only as it is lost in
decalcified section.
Dentin lies under the enamel and comprises most of the tooth
substance. It is composed of organic material in the form of
collagen fibrils as well as inorganic material in the form of
calcium phosphates as in bone. Dentin is composed of
odontoblasts or dentin cells which are counterparts of
osteocytes in bone but differ from the latter in having
odontoblast processes. Dentin in the crown of tooth is covered
with thicker layer of enamel.
Cementum is the portion of tooth which covers the dentin at
the root of tooth and is the site where periodontal ligament
is attached. Cementum is similar to bone in morphology and
composition.
Dental pulp is inner to dentine and occupies the pulp cavity
and root canal. It consists of connective tissue, blood vessels
and nerves.
Nests of odontogenic epithelium are normally present in
the jaw and may develop into cysts and tumours.
DENTAL CARIES
Dental caries is the most common disease of dental tissues,
causing destruction of the calcified tissues of the teeth.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Dental caries is essentially a
disease of modern society, associated with diet containing
high proportion of refined carbohydrates. It has been known
for almost 100 years that mixture of sugar or bread with
saliva in the presence of acidogenic bacteria of the mouth,
especially streptococci, produces organic acids which can
decalcify enamel and dentin. Enamel is largely composed
of inorganic material which virtually disintegrates. Dentin
contains organic material also which is left after
decalcification. Bacteria present in the oral cavity cause
proteolysis of the remaining organic material of dentin,
completing the process of destruction. Diets rich in
carbohydrates do not require much chewing and thus the
soft and sticky food gets clung to the teeth rather than being
cleared away, particularly in the areas of occlusal pits and
fissures. ‘Bacterial plaques’ are formed in such stagnation
areas. If these plaques are not removed by brushing or by
vigorous chewing of fibrous foods, the process of tooth
decay begins. There is evidence that consumption of water
containing one part per million (ppm) fluoride is sufficient
to reduce the rate of tooth decay in children.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Caries occurs chiefly in the
areas of pits and fissures, mainly of the molars and
premolars, where food retention occurs, and in the cervical
part of the tooth.
Grossly, the earliest change is the appearance of a small,
chalky-white spot on the enamel which subsequently
enlarges and often becomes yellow or brown and breaks
down to form carious cavity. Eventually, the cavity
becomes larger due to fractures of enamel. Once the lesion

Dental caries. There is complete destruction of enamel,
deposition of secondary dentine and evidence of pulpitis.

529
CHAPTER 19
The Oral Cavity and Salivary Glands
reaches enamel-dentin junction, destruction of dentine
also begins.
Microscopically, inflammation (pulpitis) and necrosis of
pulp take place. There is evidence of reaction of the tooth
to the carious process in the form of secondary dentin, which
is a layer of odontoblasts laid down under the original
dentine (Fig. 19.8).
SEQUELAE OF CARIES. Carious destruction of dental hard
tissues frequently produces pulpitis and other inflammatory
lesions like apical granuloma and apical abscess. Less
common causes of these lesions are fracture of tooth and
accidental exposure of pulp by the dentist.
1.
Pulpitis. Pulpitis may be acute or chronic.
Acute pulpitis is accompanied by severe pain which may
be continuous, throbbing or dull, and is accentuated by heat
or cold. It is often accompanied by mild fever and
leucocytosis.
Chronic pulpitis occurs when pulp is exposed widely. It is
often not associated with pain. Chronically inflamed pulp
tissue may protrude through the cavity forming polyp of the
pulp. It may be partly covered by implanted squamous
epithelium.
2.
Apical granuloma. Pulpitis may lead to spread of
infection through the apical foramen into the tissues
surrounding the root of the tooth.
Histologically, there is chronic inflammatory reaction
with formation of granulation tissue and inclusion of nests
or strands of squamous epithelium derived from remnants
of odontogenic epithelium normally present in the
periodontal membrane. An apical granuloma may
develop into a dental (radicular) cyst as discussed below.
3.
Apical abscess. An apical granuloma or acute pulpitis
may develop into apical abscess. Acute abscess is very
painful, while pus in chronic abscess may escape through
root canal and cause further complications like osteomyelitis,
cellulitis, cerebral abscess, meningitis and cavernous sinus
thrombosis.
PERIODONTAL DISEASE
Chronic inflammation and degeneration of the supporting
tissues of teeth resulting in teeth loss is a common condition.
Besides inflammation, other diseases associated with gingi-
val swelling are leukaemia, scurvy, fibrous hyperplasia and
epulis.
The inflammatory periodontal disease affects adults more
commonly. Pregnancy, puberty and use of drugs like dilantin
are associated with periodontal disease more often. The
disease begins as chronic marginal gingivitis, secondary to
bacterial plaques around the teeth such as due to calculus
(tartar) on the tooth surface, impacted food, uncontrolled
diabetes, tooth-decay and ill-fitting dental appliances. The
gingival sulcus acts as convenient site for lodgement of food
debris and bacterial plaque leading to formation of
periodontal pocket from which purulent discharge can be
expressed by digital pressure.
Microscopically, chronic marginal gingivitis is charac-
terised by heavy chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate,
destruction of collagen, and epithelial hyperplasia so as
to line the pocket. Untreated chronic marginal gingivitis
slowly progresses to chronic periodontitis or pyorrhoea in
which there is inflammatory destruction of deeper tissues.
At this stage, progressive resorption of alveolar bone
occurs and the tooth ultimately gets detached.
EPITHELIAL CYSTS OF THE JAW
The epithelium-lined cysts of dental tissue can have
inflammatory or developmental origin. A classification of
such cysts is given in Table 19.4.
A. INFLAMMATORY CYSTS
Radicular Cyst
Radicular cyst, also called as apical, periodontal or simply
dental cyst, is the most common cyst originating from the
dental tissues. It arises consequent to inflammation following
destruction of dental pulp such as in dental caries, pulpitis,
and apical granuloma. The epithelial cells of Mallasez, which
are nests of odontogenic epithelium embedded in the
periodontium, proliferate within apical granuloma under the
influence of inflammation, leading to the formation of an
epithelium-lined cystic cavity. Most often, radicular cyst is
observed at the apex of an erupted tooth and sometimes
contains thick pultaceous material.
Histologically, the radicular cyst is lined by nonkera-
tinised squamous epithelium. Epithelial rete processes
may penetrate the underlying connective tissues.
Radicular cyst of the maxilla may be lined by respiratory
epithelium. The cyst wall is fibrous and contains chronic
inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells with
Russell bodies and macrophages) hyaline bodies and
deposits of cholesterol crystals which may be associated
with foreign body giant cells (Fig. 19.9).

Systemic Pathology
Figure 19.10
Dentigerous (Follicular) cyst. The cyst is composed
of thin fibrous tissue wall and is lined by stratified squamous epithelium.
A partly formed unerupted tooth is also seen in the wall. Inflammatory
changes are conspicuously absent.
Figure 19.9
Dental (Radicular) cyst. The cyst wall is composed of fibrous
tissue and is lined by non-keratinised squamous epithelium. The cyst wall is
densely infiltrated by chronic inflammatory cells, chiefly lymphocytes, plasma
cells and macrophages.
B. DEVELOPMENTAL CYSTS
Odontogenic Cysts
DENTIGEROUS (FOLLICULAR) CYST. Dentigerous cyst
arises from enamel of an unerupted tooth. The mandibular
third molars and the maxillary canines are most often
involved. Dentigerous cysts are less common than radicular
cysts and occur more commonly in children and young
individuals. These cysts are more significant because of
reported occurrence of ameloblastoma and carcinoma in
them.
Histologically, dentigerous cyst is composed of a thin
fibrous tissue wall lined by stratified squamous
epithelium. Thus, the cyst may resemble radicular cyst,
except that chronic inflammatory changes so characteristic
of radicular cyst, are usually absent in dentigerous cyst
(Fig. 19.10).
ERUPTION CYST. This is a cyst lying over the crown of an
unerupted tooth and is lined by stratified squamous
epithelium. It is thus a form of dentigerous cyst.
GINGIVAL CYST. It arises from the epithelial rests in the
gingiva and is lined by keratinising squamous epithelium.
PRIMORDIAL CYST (ODONTOGENIC KERATOCYST).
Primordial cyst, like dentigerous cyst, also arises from tooth-
forming epithelium. The common location is mandibular
third molar.
Histologically, the cyst wall is thin and is lined by regular
layer of keratinising stratified squamous epithelium.
Inflammatory changes are normally absent. Primordial
cysts have a marked tendency to recur (50%). Multiple
primordial cysts occur in association with naevoid basal
cell carcinoma syndrome.
Non-odontogenic and Fissural Cysts
NASOPALATINE DUCT (INCISIVE CANAL, MEDIAN,
ANTERIOR MAXILLARY) CYST. This is the most common
non-odontogenic (fissural) cyst and arises from the epithelial
remnants of the nasopalatine duct.
Histologically, the cyst is lined by stratified squamous
epithelium, respiratory epithelium, or both.
NASOLABIAL (NASOALVEOLAR) CYST. This cyst is
situated in the soft tissues at the junction of median nasal,
lateral nasal and maxillary processes, at the ala of the nose,
and sometimes extending into the nostril.
Histologically, the cyst is lined by squamous or
respiratory epithelium, or both.

531
CHAPTER 19
The Oral Cavity and Salivary Glands
GLOBULOMAXILLARY CYST. This is an intraosseous cyst
and is rare.
DERMOID CYST. The dermoid cyst is common in the region
of head or neck, especially in the floor of the mouth. The cyst
arises from remains in the midline during closure of
mandibular and branchial arches.
ODONTOGENIC TUMOURS
Odontogenic tumours are a group of uncommon lesions of
the jaw derived from the odontogenic apparatus. These
tumours are usually benign but some have malignant
counterparts. An abbreviated WHO classification is
presented in Table 19.5.
A. BENIGN ODONTOGENIC TUMOURS
Ameloblastoma
Ameloblastoma is the most common benign but locally
invasive epithelial odontogenic tumour. It is most frequent
in the 3rd to 5th decades of life. Preferential sites are the
mandible in the molar-ramus area and the maxilla. The
tumour originates from dental epithelium of the enamel itself
or its epithelial residues. Sometimes, the tumour may arise
from the epithelial lining of a dentigerous cyst or from basal
layer of oral mucosa. Radiologically, typical picture is of a
multilocular destruction of the bone. Rare instances of an
extraosseous example, presence of an embedded tooth, or
unilocular ameloblastoma can occur. Tumour with histologic
resemblance to ameloblastoma can occur occasionally in the
long bone, like adamantinoma of the tibia (Chapter 28).
Grossly, the tumour is greyish-white, usually solid,
sometimes cystic, replacing and expanding the affected
bone.
Histologically, ameloblastoma can show different
patterns as follows:
i)
Follicular pattern is the most common. The tumour
consists of follicles of variable size and shape and
separated from each other by fibrous tissue. The structure
of follicles is similar to that of enamel organ consisting of
central area of stellate cells resembling stellate reticulum,
and peripheral layer of cuboidal or columnar cells
resembling epithelium. The central stellate areas may
show cystic changes (Fig. 19.11).
ii) Plexiform pattern is the next common pattern after folli-
cular pattern. The tumour epithelium is seen to form
irregular plexiform masses or network of strands. The
stroma is usually scanty. Microcyst formation can occur
in the stroma.
iii) Acanthomatous pattern is squamous metaplasia within
the islands of tumour cells.

532
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
iv) Basal cell pattern of ameloblastoma is similar to basal
cell carcinoma of the skin.
v) Granular cell pattern is characterised by appearance of
acidophilic granularity in the cytoplasm of tumour cells.
Combination of more than one morphologic pattern
may also be seen.
Tumour cells in ameloblastoma exhibit positive
immunostaining for cytokeratin and laminin as are seen
in developing tooth.
Odontogenic Adenomatoid Tumour
(Adeno-ameloblastoma)
This is a benign tumour seen more often in females in their
2nd decade of life. The tumour is commonly associated with
an unerupted tooth and thus closely resembles dentigerous
cyst radiologically. Unlike ameloblastoma, adenomatoid
odontogenic tumour is not invasive nor does it recur after
enucleation.
Histologically, the lesion has extensive cyst formations.
The wall of cyst contains scanty fibrous connective tissue
in which are present characteristic tubule-like structures
composed of epithelial cells and hence the name
‘adenomatoid’ (gland-like).
Calcifying Epithelial Odontogenic Tumour
This is a rare lesion which is locally invasive and recurrent
like ameloblastoma. It is seen commonly in 4th and 5th
decades and occurs more commonly in the region of
mandible.
Histologically, the tumour consists of closely packed
polyhedral epithelial cells having features of nuclear
pleomorphism, giant nuclei and rare mitotic figures. The
stroma is often scanty and appears homogeneous and
hyalinised in which small calcified deposits are seen which
are a striking feature of this tumour.
Odontogenic Myxoma (Myxofibroma)
Odontogenic myxoma is a locally invasive and recurring
tumour.
Microscopically, it is characterised by abundant mucoid
stroma and loose stellate cells in which are seen a few
strands of odontogenic epithelium.
Ameloblastic Fibroma
This is a benign tumour consisting of epithelial and connec-
tive tissues derived from odontogenic apparatus. It resembles
ameloblastoma but can be distinguished from it because
ameloblastic fibroma occurs in younger age group (below
20 years) and the clinical behaviour is always benign.
Histologically, it consists of epithelial follicles similar to
those of ameloblastoma, set in a very cellular connective
tissue stroma.
Odontomas
Odontomas are hamartomas that contain both epithelial and
mesodermal dental tissue components. There are 3 subtypes:
i)
Complex odontoma is always benign and consists of
enamel, dentin and cementum which are not differentiated,
so that the structure of actual tooth is not identifiable.
ii) Compound odontoma is also benign and is comprised
of differentiated dental tissue elements forming a number of
denticles in fibrous tissue.
iii) Ameloblastic fibro-odontoma is a lesion that resembles
ameloblastic fibroma with odontoma formation.
Cementomas
Cementomas are a variety of benign lesions which are charac-
terised by the presence of cementum or cementum-like tissue.
Five types of cementomas are described:
i)
Benign cementoblastoma (true cementoma) is a solitary
lesion of jaw, characterised by features comparable to those
of osteoid osteoma and osteoblastoma.
ii) Cementifying fibroma consists of cellular fibrous tissue
containing calcified masses of cementum-like tissue.
iii) Periapical cemental dysplasia (Periapical fibrous
dysplasia) is most common and resembles cementifying
fibroma except that it contains more fibrous tissue as well as
cementum-like tissue.
iv) Multiple apical cementomas are found on the apical
region of teeth and detected incidentally in postmenopausal
women.
v) Gigantiform cementoma is a large lobulated mass of
cementum-like tissue. Sometimes, there are multiple such
masses in the jaw.
B. MALIGNANT ODONTOGENIC TUMOURS
Malignant odontogenic tumours are rare.
Odontogenic Carcinoma
i)
Malignant ameloblastoma is the term used for the
uncommon metastasising ameloblastoma.
ii) Ameloblastic carcinoma is the term employed for the
ameloblastic tumour having cytologic features of malignancy
in the primary tumour.
iii) Primary intraosseous carcinoma may develop within the jaw
from the rests of odontogenic epithelium.
iv) Rarely, carcinomas may arise from the odontogenic
epithelium lining the odontogenic cysts.
Odontogenic Sarcomas
The only example of odontogenic sarcoma is a rare
ameloblastic fibrosarcoma. This tumour resembles amelo-
blastic fibroma but the mesodermal component in it is
malignant (sarcomatous) whereas the ameloblastic
epithelium remains differentiated and benign.

533
CHAPTER 19
The Oral Cavity and Salivary Glands
SALIVARY GLANDS
NORMAL STRUCTURE
There are two main groups of salivary glands—major and
minor. The major salivary glands are the three paired glands:
parotid, submandibular and sublingual. The minor salivary
glands are numerous and are widely distributed in the
mucosa of oral cavity. The main duct of the parotid gland
drains into the oral cavity opposite the second maxillary
molar, while the ducts of submandibular and sublingual
glands empty in the floor of the mouth. At times, heterotopic
salivary gland tissue may be present in lymph nodes near or
within the parotid gland.
Histologically, the salivary glands are tubuloalveolar glands
and may contain mucous cells, serous cells, or both. The
parotid gland is purely serous. The submandibular gland is
mixed type but is predominantly serous, whereas the
sublingual gland though also a mixed gland is predominantly
mucous type. Similarly, minor salivary glands may also be
serous, mucous or mixed type.
The secretory acini of the major salivary glands are
drained by ducts lined by:
low cuboidal epithelium in the intercalated portion,
tall columnar epithelium in the intralobular ducts, and
simpler epithelium in the secretory ducts.
The product of major salivary glands is saliva which
performs various functions such as lubrication for swallow-
ing and speech, and has enzyme amylase and antibacterial
properties too.
SALIVARY FLOW DISTURBANCES
SIALORRHOEA (PTYALISM). Increased flow of saliva is
termed sialorrhoea or ptyalism. It occurs commonly due to:
stomatitis, teething, mentally retarded state, schizophrenia,
neurological disturbances, increased gastric secretion and
sialosis (i.e. uniform, symmetric, painless hypertrophy of
salivary glands).
XEROSTOMIA. Decreased salivary flow is termed xero-
stomia. It is associated with the following conditions:
Sjögren’s syndrome, sarcoidosis, mumps parotitis, Mikulicz’s
syndrome, megaloblastic anaemia, dehydration, drug intake
(e.g. antihistamines, antihypertensives, antidepressants).
SIALADENITIS
Inflammation of salivary glands, sialadenitis, may be acute
or chronic; the latter being more common.
ETIOLOGY. Sialadenitis can occur due to the following
causes:
1.
Viral infections. The most common inflammatory lesion
of the salivary glands particularly of the parotid glands, is
mumps occurring in children of school-age. It is characterised
by triad of pathological involvement—epidemic parotitis
(mumps), orchitis-oophoritis, and pancreatitis (Fig. 19.12).
Involvement of the testis and pancreas may lead to their
atrophy. Less commonly, cytomegalovirus infection may
occur in parotid glands of infants and young children.
2.
Bacterial and mycotic infections. Bacterial infections may
cause acute sialadenitis more often. Sometimes there are
recurrent attacks of acute parotitis when parotitis becomes
chronic.
i)
Acute sialadenitis: The causes are as follows:
a) Acute infectious fevers
b) Acute postoperative parotitis (ascent of microorganisms
up the parotid duct from the mouth)
c)
General debility
d) Old age
e) Dehydration.
ii) Chronic sialadenitis. This may result from the following
causes:
a)
Recurrent obstructive type. Recurrent obstruction due to
calculi (sialolithiasis), stricture, surgery, injury etc. may cause
repeated attacks of acute sialadenitis by ascending infection
and then chronicity.
b) Recurrent non-obstructive type. Recurrent mild ascending
infection of the parotid gland may occur due to non-
obstructive causes which reduce salivary secretion like due
to intake of drugs causing hyposalivation (e.g. antihista-
mines, antihypertensives, antidepressants), effect of
irradiation and congenital malformations of the duct system.
c)
Chronic inflammatory diseases. Tuberculosis, actinomycosis
and other mycoses may rarely occur in the salivary glands.
3.
Autoimmune disease. Inflammatory changes are seen in
salivary glands in 2 autoimmune diseases:
i)
Sjögren’s syndrome characterised by triad of dry eyes
(keratoconjunctivitis sicca), dry mouth (xerostomia) and
rheumatoid arthritis (Chapter 4).
ii) Mikulicz’s syndrome is the combination of inflammatory
enlargement of salivary and lacrimal glands with xerostomia.

MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Irrespective of the under-
lying etiology of sialadenitis, there is swelling of the
affected salivary gland, usually restricted by the fibrous
capsule. Acute stage is generally associated with local
redness, pain and tenderness with purulent ductal
discharge. Late chronic cases may be replaced by firm
fibrous swelling.
Microscopically, acute viral sialadenitis in mumps shows
swelling and cytoplasmic vacuolation of the acinar
epithelial cells and degenerative changes in the ductal
epithelium. There is interstitial oedema, fibrinoid degene-
ration of the collagen and dense infiltration by mono-
nuclear cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells and macro-
phages). Chronic and recurrent sialadenitis is characterised
by increased lymphoid tissue in the interstitium,
progressive loss of secretory tissue and replacement by
fibrosis.
TUMOURS OF SALIVARY GLANDS
The major as well as minor salivary glands can give rise to a
variety of benign and malignant tumours (Table 19.6). The
major glands, particularly the parotid glands (85%), are the
most common sites. Majority of parotid gland tumour (65-
85%) are benign, while in the other major and minor salivary
glands 35-50% of the tumours are malignant. Most of the
salivary gland tumours originate from the ductal lining
epithelium and the underlying myoepithelial cells; a few arise
from acini. Recurrent tumours of the parotid glands, due to
their location, are often associated with facial palsy and
obvious scarring following surgical treatment.
A. BENIGN SALIVARY GLAND TUMOURS
ADENOMAS
The adenomas of the salivary glands are benign epithelial
tumours. They are broadly classified into 2 major groups—
pleomorphic and monomorphic adenomas.
Pleomorphic Adenoma  (Mixed Salivary Tumour)
This is the most common tumour of major (60-75%) and
minor (50%) salivary glands. Pleomorphic adenoma is the
commonest tumour in the parotid gland and occurs less often
in other major and minor salivary glands. The tumour is
commoner in women and is seen more frequently in 3rd to
5th decades of life. The tumour is solitary, smooth-surfaced
but sometimes nodular, painless and slow-growing. It is often
located below and in front of the ear (Fig. 19.13).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, pleomorphic
adenoma is a circumscribed, pseudoencapsulated,
rounded, at times multilobulated, firm mass, 2-5 cm in
diameter, with bosselated surface. The cut surface is grey-
white and bluish, variegated, semitranslucent, usually

535
CHAPTER 19
The Oral Cavity and Salivary Glands
solid but occasionally may show small cystic spaces. The
consistency is soft and mucoid.
Microscopically, the pleomorphic adenoma is charac-
terised by pleomorphic or ‘mixed’ appearance in which
there are epithelial elements present in a matrix of mucoid,
myxoid and chondroid tissue (Fig. 19.14):
Epithelial component may form various patterns like
ducts, acini, tubules, sheets and strands of cells of ductal
or myoepithelial origin. The ductal cells are cuboidal or
columnar, while the underlying myoepithelial cells may
be polygonal or spindle-shaped resembling smooth
muscle cells. The material found in the lumina of duct-
like structures is PAS-positive epithelial mucin. Focal
areas of squamous metaplasia and keratinisation may be
present. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells are
immunoreactive for epithelial (cytokeratin, EMA, CEA)
as well as myoepithelial (actin, vimentin and S-100)
antibodies.
Mesenchymal elements are present as loose
connective tissue, and as myxoid, mucoid and chondroid
matrix, which simulates cartilage (pseudocartilage) but is
actually connective tissue mucin. the matrix of the tumour
has been characterised as a product of myoepithelial cells
as seen by S-100 immunostain positivity. However, true
cartilage and even bone may also be observed in a small
proportion of these tumours.
The epithelial and mesenchymal elements are inter-
mixed and either of the two components may be dominant
in any tumour.
PROGNOSIS. Pleomorphic adenoma is notorious for
recurrences, sometimes after many years. The main factors
responsible for the tendency to recur are incomplete surgical
removal due to proximity to the facial nerve, multiple foci of
tumour, pseudoencapsulation, and implantation in the
surgical field. Although the tumour is entirely benign, under
exceptionally rare circumstances, an ordinary pleomorphic
adenoma may metastasise to distant sites which too will have
benign appearance as the original tumour. However, actual
malignant transformation can also occur in a pleomorphic
adenoma (vide infra).
Monomorphic Adenomas
These are benign epithelial tumours of salivary glands
without any evidence of mesenchyme-like tissues. Their
various forms are as under:
WARTHIN’S TUMOUR (PAPILLARY CYSTADENOMA
LYMPHOMATOSUM, ADENOLYMPHOMA). It is a
benign tumour of the parotid gland comprising about 8% of
all parotid neoplasms, seen more commonly in men from
4th to 7th decades of life. Rarely, it may arise in the submandi-
bular gland or in minor salivary glands. Histogenesis of the
tumour has been much debated; most accepted theory is that
the tumour develops from parotid ductal epithelium present
in lymph nodes adjacent to or within parotid gland.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
encapsulated, round or oval with smooth surface. The cut
surface shows characteristic slit-like or cystic spaces,
containing milky fluid and having papillary projections.
Microscopically, the tumour shows 2 components:
epithelial parenchyma and lymphoid stroma (Fig.  19.15):
Epithelial parenchyma is composed of glandular and
cystic structures having papillary arrangement and is
lined by characteristic eosinophilic epithelium. Variants
of epithelial patterns include presence of mucous goblet
cells and sebaceous differentiation.
Lymphoid stroma is present under the epithelium in
the form of prominent lymphoid tissue, often with
germinal centres.
OXYPHIL ADENOMA (ONCOCYTOMA). It is a benign
slow-growing tumour of the major salivary glands. The
tumour consists of parallel sheets, acini or tubules of large
Figure 19.14
Pleomorphic adenoma. The epithelial element is comprised of ducts, acini, tubules, sheets and strands of cuboidal and myoepithelial
cells. These are seen randomly admixed with mesenchymal elements composed of pseudocartilage which is the matrix of myxoid, chondroid and
mucoid material.

cells with glandular eosinophilic cytoplasm (oncocytes). It
is also called as mitochondrioma because of cytoplasmic
granularity due to mitochondria.
OTHER TYPES OF MONOMORPHIC ADENOMAS.
There are some uncommon forms of monomorphic
adenomas:
i)
Myoepithelioma is an adenoma composed exclusively of
myoepithelial cells which may be arranged in tubular,
alveolar or trabecular pattern.
ii) Basal cell adenoma is characterised by the type and
arrangement of cells resembling basal cell carcinoma of the
skin.
iii) Clear cell adenoma has spindle-shaped or polyhedral cells
with clear cytoplasm.
MISCELLANEOUS BENIGN TUMOURS
A number of mesenchymal tumours can rarely occur in
salivary glands. These include: fibroma, lipoma, neurilem-
momas, neurofibroma, haemangioma and lymphangioma.
B. MALIGNANT SALIVARY GLAND TUMOURS
Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma
The status of ‘mucoepidermoid tumour’ as an intermediate
grade tumour in the previous classification has undergone
upgradation to mucoepidermoid carcinoma now having the
following peculiar features:
It is the most common malignant salivary gland tumour
(both in the major and minor glands).
The parotid gland amongst the major salivary glands and
the minor salivary glands in the palate are the most common
sites.
Common age group affected is 30-60 years but it is also
the most common malignant salivary gland tumour affecting
children and adolescents.
It is the most common example of radiation-induced malig-
nant tumour, especially therapeutic radiation.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
usually circumscribed but not encapsulated. It varies in
size from 1 to 4 cm.
Microscopically, the tumour is classified into low, inter-
mediate and high grade depending upon the degree of
differentiation and tumour invasiveness. The tumour is
composed of combination of 4 types of cells: mucin-
producing, squamous, intermediate and clear cells. Well-
differentiated tumours have predominance of mucinous
cells, while poorly differentiated have more solid and
infiltrative pattern (Fig. 19.16).

CHAPTER 19
The Oral Cavity and Salivary Glands
Malignant Mixed Tumour
Malignant mixed tumour comprises three distinct
clinicopathologic entities:
Carcinoma arising in benign mixed salivary gland tumour
(carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma);
Carcinosarcoma; and
Metastasising mixed salivary tumour.
Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma is more common
while the other two are rare tumours. Approximately 2 to
5% of pleomorphic adenomas reveal areas of frank
malignancy. The slow-growing adenoma may have been
present for a number of years when suddenly it undergoes
rapid increase in its size, becomes painful and the individual
may develop facial palsy. Malignant transformation occurs
in later age (6th decade) than the usual age for pleomorphic
adenoma (4th to 6th decades). It may occur in primary
tumour but more often occurs in its recurrences.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
poorly-circumscribed with irregular infiltrating margin.
Cut section may show haemorrhages, necrosis and cystic
degeneration.
Microscopically, besides the typical appearance of
pleomorphic adenoma, malignant areas show cytologic
features of carcinoma such as anaplasia, nuclear
hyperchromatism, large nucleolisation, mitoses and
evidence of invasive growth. All types of usual salivary
gland carcinomas (described below) may develop in
pleomorphic adenoma.
Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (Cylindroma)
This is a highly malignant tumour due to its typical infil-
trative nature, especially along the nerve sheaths. Adenoid
cystic carcinoma is histologically characterised by cribriform
appearance i.e. the epithelial tumour cells of duct-lining and
myoepithelial cells are arranged in duct-like structures or
masses of cells, having typical fenestrations or cyst-like
spaces and hence the name ‘adenoid cystic’. These cystic
spaces contain PAS-positive basophilic material (Fig. 19.17).
Acinic Cell Carcinoma
This is a rare tumour composed of acinic cells resembling
serous cells of normal salivary gland. These cells are arranged
in sheets or acini and have characteristic basophilic granular
cytoplasm. The degree of atypia may vary from a benign
cytologic appearance to cellular features of malignancy.
Adenocarcinoma
Adenocarcinoma of the salivary gland does not differ from
adenocarcinoma elsewhere in the body. It may have some
variants such as mucoid adenocarcinoma, clear-cell
adenocarcinoma and papillary cystadenocarcinoma.
Epidermoid Carcinoma
This rare tumour has features of squamous cell carcinoma
with keratin formation and has intercellular bridges. The
tumour commonly infiltrates the skin and involves the facial
nerve early.
Undifferentiated Carcinoma
This highly malignant tumour consists of anaplastic epithe-
lial cells which are too poorly differentiated to be placed in
any other known category.
Miscellaneous Malignant Tumours
Some rare malignant tumour of epithelial and mesenchymal
origin are melanoma, sebaceous carcinoma, undifferentiated
carcinoma, lymphoma, fibrosarcoma and leiomyosarcoma
and are similar in morphology to such tumours elsewhere
in the body. Besides, metastatic involvement of major salivary
glands or the adjacent lymph nodes is common, especially
from epidermoid carcinoma and malignant melanoma.

OESOPHAGUS
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The oesophagus is a muscular tube extending from the
pharynx to the stomach. In an adult, this distance measures
25 cm. However, from the clinical point of view, the distance
from the incisor teeth to the gastro-oesophageal (GE) junction
is about 40 cm. The region of proximal oesophagus at the
level of cricopharyngeus muscle is called the upper oesophageal
sphincter, while the portion adjacent to the anatomic gastro-
oesophageal junction is referred to as lower oesophageal
sphincter.
Histologically, the wall of the oesophagus consists of
mucosa, submucosa, muscularis propria and adventitia/
serosa.
The mucosa is composed of non-keratinising stratified
squamous epithelium overlying lamina propria except at the
lower end for a distance of 0.5 to 1.5 cm. The basal layer of
the epithelium may contain some melanocytes, argyrophil
cells and Langerhans’ cells. At the lower end of the
oesophagus, there is sudden change from stratified
squamous epithelium to mucin-secreting columnar
epithelium; this is called the junctional mucosa.
The submucosa consists of loose connective tissue with
sprinkling of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and occasional
eosinophil and mast cell. Mucus-producing glands are
scattered throughout the submucosa.
The muscularis propria is composed of 2 layers of smooth
muscle—an inner circular coat and an outer longitudinal coat.
The proximal portion of oesophagus contains skeletal muscle
fibres from cricopharyngeus muscle. The parasympathetic
nerve supply by the vagus nerve is in the form of extrinsic
and intrinsic plexuses.
The adventitia/serosa is the outer covering of
oesophagus. Serosa is present in intra-abdominal part of
oesophagus only, while elsewhere the perioesophageal
adventitia covers it.
The major functions of oesophagus are swallowing by
peristaltic activity and to prevent the reflux of gastric contents
into the oesophagus.
CONGENITAL ANOMALIES
Congenital anomalies of the oesophagus are uncommon and
are detected soon after birth. These include a few rare
anomalies such as agenesis (congenital absence of
oesophagus) which is incompatible with life, duplication of
oesophagus  (double oesophagus) and congenital stenosis (i.e.
fibrous thickening of the oesophageal wall and atrophy of
the muscularis propria). However, oesophageal atresia and
tracheooesophageal fistula are relatively more common.
OESOPHAGEAL ATRESIA AND TRACHEO-OESO-
PHAGEAL FISTULA. In about 85% of cases, congenital
atresia of the oesophagus is associated with tracheo-
oesophageal fistula, usually at the level of tracheal bifur-
cation. For survival, the condition must be recognised and
corrected surgically within 48 hours of birth of the newborn.
Clinically, the condition is characterised by regurgitation of
every feed, hypersalivation, attacks of cough and cyanosis.
Death usually results from asphyxia, aspiration pneumonia
and fluid-electrolyte imbalance.
Morphologically, the condition is recognised by cord-like
non-canalised segment of oesophagus having blind pouch
at both ends.
MUSCULAR DYSFUNCTIONS
These are disorders in which there is motor dysfunction of
the oesophagus, manifested clinically by dysphagia. These
include achalasia, hiatus hernia, oesophageal diverticula, and
webs and rings.
Achalasia (Cardiospasm)
Achalasia of the oesophagus is a neuromuscular dysfunction
due to which the cardiac sphincter fails to relax during
swallowing and results in progressive dysphagia and
dilatation of the oesophagus (mega-oesophagus).
ETIOLOGY. There is loss of intramural neurons in the wall
of the oesophagus.  Most cases are of primary idiopathic
achalasia which may be congenital. Secondary achalasia may
occur from some other causes which includes:  Chagas’ disease
(an epidemic parasitosis with Trypansoma cruzi), infiltration
into oesophagus by gastric carcinoma or lymphoma, certain
viral infections,  and neurodegenerative diseases.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. There is dilatation above
the short contracted terminal segment of the oesophagus.
Muscularis propria of the wall may be of normal thickness,
hypertrophied as a result of obstruction, or thinned out
due to dilatation. Secondary oesophagitis may supervene
and cause oesophageal ulceration and haematemesis.
Hiatus Hernia
Hiatus hernia is the herniation or protrusion of part of the
stomach through the oesophageal hiatus of the diaphragm.
Oesophageal hiatal hernia is the cause of diaphragmatic

539
CHAPTER 20
The Gastrointestinal Tract
hernia in 98% of cases. The condition is diagnosed radio-
logically in about 5% of apparently normal asymptomatic
individuals. In symptomatic cases, especially the elderly
women, the clinical features are heartburn (retrosternal
burning sensation) and regurgitation of gastric juice into the
mouth, both of which are worsened due to heavy work, lifting
weights and excessive bending.
ETIOLOGY. The basic defect is the failure of the muscle
fibres of the diaphragm that form the margin of the
oesophageal hiatus. This occurs due to shortening of the
oesophagus which may be congenital or acquired.
Congenitally short oesophagus may be the cause of
hiatus hernia in a small proportion of cases.
More commonly, it is acquired due to secondary factors
which cause fibrous scarring of the oesophagus as follows:
a) Degeneration of muscle due to aging.
b) Increased intra-abdominal pressure such as in pregnancy,
abdominal tumours etc.
c) Recurrent oesophageal regurgitation and spasm causing
inflammation and fibrosis.
d) Increase in fatty tissue in obese people causing decreased
muscular elasticity of diaphragm.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. There are 3 patterns in
hiatus hernia (Fig. 20.1):
i)
Sliding or oesophago-gastric hernia is the most
common, occurring in 85% of cases. The herniated part of
the stomach appears as supradiaphragmatic bell due to
sliding up on both sides of the oesophagus.
ii) Rolling or para-oesophageal hernia is seen in 10% of
cases. This is a true hernia in which cardiac end of the
stomach rolls up para-oesophageally, producing an
intrathoracic sac.
iii) Mixed or transitional hernia constitutes the remain-
ing 5% cases in which there is combination of sliding and
rolling hiatus hernia.
Oesophageal Diverticula
Diverticula are the outpouchings of oesophageal wall at the
point of weakness. They may be congenital or acquired.
Congenital diverticula occur either at the upper end of
the oesophagus or at the bifurcation of trachea.
Acquired diverticula may be of 2 types:
a) Pulsion (Zenker’s) type—is seen in the region of hypo-
pharynx and occurs due to oesophageal obstruction such as
due to chronic oesophagitis, carcinoma etc. The mucosa and
submucosa herniate through the weakened area or through
defect in the muscularis propria.
b) Traction type—occurs in the lower third of oesophagus
from contraction of fibrous tissue such as from pleural
adhesions, scar tissue of healed tuberculous lesions in the
hilum, silicosis etc.
Complications of diverticula include obstruction, infec-
tion, perforation, haemorrhage and carcinoma.
Oesophageal Webs and Rings
Radiological shadows in the oesophagus resembling ‘webs’
and ‘rings’ are observed in some patients complaining of
dysphagia.
WEBS. Those located in the upper oesophagus, seen more
commonly in adult women, and associated with dysphagia,
iron deficiency anaemia and chronic atrophic glossitis
(Plummer-Vinson syndrome) are called ‘webs’.
RINGS. Those located in the lower oesophagus, not
associated with iron-deficiency anaemia, nor occurring in
women alone, are referred to as ‘Schatzki’s rings’.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The rings and webs are
transverse folds of mucosa and submucosa encircling the
entire circumference, or are localised annular thickenings
of the muscle (Fig. 20.2). These give characteristic
radiological shadows.
HAEMATEMESIS OF OESOPHAGEAL ORIGIN
Massive haematemesis (vomiting of blood) may occur due
to vascular lesions in the oesophagus. These lesions are as
under:
1.
OESOPHAGEAL VARICES. Oesophageal varices are
tortuous, dilated and engorged oesophageal veins, seen along
Figure 20.1
Patterns of hiatus hernia.
Figure 20.2
Oesophageal webs and rings.

540
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
the longitudinal axis of oesophagus. They occur as a result
of elevated pressure in the portal venous system, most
commonly in cirrhosis of the liver (Chapter 22). Less common
causes are: portal vein thrombosis, hepatic vein thrombosis
(Budd-Chiari syndrome) and pylephlebitis. The lesions occur
as a result of bypassing of portal venous blood from the liver
to the oesophageal venous plexus. The increased venous
pressure in the superficial veins of the oesophagus may result
in ulceration and massive bleeding.
2.
MALLORY-WEISS SYNDROME. In this condition,
there is lacerations of mucosa at the gastro-oesophageal
junction following minor trauma such as by vomiting,
retching or vigorous coughing. Patients present with upper
gastro-oesophageal bleeding.
3.
RUPTURE OF THE OESOPHAGUS. Rupture of the
oesophagus may occur following trauma, during
oesophagoscopy, indirect injury (e.g. due to sudden accele-
ration and deceleration of the body) and spontaneous rupture
(e.g. after overeating, extensive aerophagy etc).
4.
OTHER CAUSES. Oesophageal haematemesis may also
occur in the following conditions:
i)
Bursting of aortic aneurysm into the lumen of oesophagus
ii) Vascular erosion by malignant growth in the vicinity
iii) Hiatus hernia
iv) Oesophageal cancer
v) Purpuras
vi) Haemophilia.
INFLAMMATORY LESIONS
Inflammation of the oesophagus, oesophagitis, occurs most
commonly from reflux, although a number of other clinical
conditions and infections may also cause oesophagitis as
under:
Reflux (Peptic) Oesophagitis
Reflux of the gastric juice is the commonest cause of
oesophagitis.
PATHOGENESIS. Gastro-oesophageal reflux, to an extent,
may occur in normal healthy individuals after meals and in
early pregnancy. However, in some clinical conditions, the
gastro-oesophageal reflux is excessive, resulting in
inflammation of the lower oesophagus. These conditions are
as under:
i)
Sliding hiatus hernia
ii) Chronic gastric and duodenal ulcers
iii) Nasogastric intubation
iv) Persistent vomiting
v) Surgical vagotomy
vi) Neuropathy in alcoholics, diabetics
vii) Oesophagogastrostomy.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Endoscopically, the
demarcation between normal squamous and columnar
epithelium at the junctional mucosa is lost. The affected
distal oesophageal mucosa is red, erythematous, friable
and bleeds on touch. In advanced cases, there are features
of chronic disease such as nodularity, strictures,
ulcerations and erosions.
Microscopically, the reflux changes in the distal
oesophagus include basal cell hyperplasia and deep
elongation of the papillae touching close to the surface
epithelium. Inflammatory changes vary according to the
stage of the disease. In early stage, mucosa and submucosa
are infiltrated by some polymorphs and eosinophils; in
chronic stage, there is lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis
of all the layers of the oesophageal wall.
Barrett’s Oesophagus
This is a condition in which, following reflux oesophagitis,
stratified squamous epithelium of the lower oesophagus is
replaced by columnar epithelium (columnar metaplasia). The
condition is seen more commonly in later age and is caused
by factors producing gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
(described above). Barrett’s oesophagus is a premalignant
condition evolving sequentially from Barrett’s epithelium
(columnar metaplasia) → dysplasia → carcinoma in situ →
oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Endoscopically, the
affected area is red and velvety. Hiatus hernia and peptic
ulcer at squamocolumnar junction (Barrett’s ulcer) are
frequently associated.
Microscopically, the most common finding is the replace-
ment of squamous epithelium by metaplastic columnar
cells. Barrett’s oesophagus may be composed of intestinal
epithelium, fundic gastric glands, or cardiac mucous
glands. Other cells present in the glands may be Paneth
cells (Fig. 20.3), goblet cells, chief cells, parietal cells,
mucus-secreting cells and endocrine cells.
Inflammatory changes, acute or chronic, are commonly
accompanied. Dysplastic changes of the columnar
epithelium or glands may be present.
Surveillance endoscopic biopsies are advised because
Barrett’s intestinal metaplasaia may develop dysplasia.
Figure 20.3

is normally lined by squamous epithelium undergoes metaplastic change
to columnar epithelium of intestinal type.

A, Carcinoma oesophagus—sites of predilection for
squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. B, Gross patterns of
squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus.
High-grade dysplasia may progress to invasive
adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus in up to 20% cases.
Infectious Oesophagitis
A number of opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed
individuals can cause oesophagitis. Some of these agents are
as follows:
i)
Candida (Monilial) oesophagitis
ii) Herpes simplex (Herpetic) oesophagitis
iii) Cytomegalovirus
iv) Tuberculosis.
Other Causes of Oesophagitis
i)
Eosinophilic oesophagitis caused by radiation, corrosives
ii) Intake of certain drugs (anticholinergic drugs,
doxycycline, tetracycline)
iii) Ingestion of hot, irritating fluids
iv) Crohn’s disease
v) Various vesiculobullous skin diseases.
TUMOURS OF OESOPHAGUS
Benign tumours of the oesophagus are uncommon and small
in size (less than 3 cm). The epithelial benign tumours project
as intraluminal masses arising from squamous epithelium
(squamous cell papilloma), or from columnar epithelium
(adenoma). The stromal or mesenchymal benign tumours are
intramural masses such as leiomyoma and others like lipoma,
fibroma, neurofibroma, rhabdomyoma, lymphangioma and
haemangioma.
For all practical purposes, malignant tumours of the oeso-
phagus are carcinomas because sarcomas such as
leiomyosarcoma and fibrosarcoma occur with extreme rarity.
Carcinoma of Oesophagus
Carcinoma of the oesophagus is diagnosed late, after
symptomatic oesophageal obstruction (dysphagia) has
developed and the tumour has transgressed the anatomical
limits of the organ. The tumour occurs more commonly in
men over 50 years of age. Prognosis is dismal: with standard
methods of therapy (surgical resection and/or irradiation),
70% of the patients die within one year of diagnosis. Five-
year survival rate is 5-10%.
ETIOLOGY. Although exact etiology of carcinoma of the
oesophagus is not known, a number of conditions and factors
have been implicated as under:
1.
Diet and personal habits:
i)
Heavy smoking
ii) Alcohol consumption
iii) Intake of foods contaminated with fungus
iv) Nutritional deficiency of vitamins and trace elements.
2.
Oesophageal disorders:
i)
Oesophagitis (especially Barrett’s oesophagus in
adenocarcinoma)
ii) Achalasia
iii) Hiatus hernia
iv) Diverticula
v) Plummer-Vinson syndrome.
3.
Other factors:
i)
Race—more common in the Chinese and Japanese than
in Western races; more frequent in blacks than whites.
ii) Family history—association with tylosis (keratosis
palmaris et plantaris).
iii) Genetic factors—predisposition with coeliac disease,
epidermolysis bullosa, tylosis.
iv) HPV infection—is the recent addition in etiologic factors.
At molecular level, abnormality of p53 tumour suppressor
gene has been found associated with a number of above risk
factors, notably with consumption of tobacco and alcohol,
and in cases having proven Barrett’s oesophagus.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Carcinoma of the oeso-
phagus is mainly of 2 types—squamous cell (epidermoid)
and adenocarcinoma. The sites of predilection for each of
these 2 forms is shown in Fig. 20.4,A.
Figure 20.4

542
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
SQUAMOUS CELL (EPIDERMOID) CARCINOMA.
Squamous cell or epidermoid carcinoma comprises 90%
of primary oesophageal cancers. It is exceeded in incidence
by carcinoma colon, rectum and stomach amongst all the
gastrointestinal cancers. The disease occurs in 6th to 7th
decades of life and is more common in men than women.
The sites of predilection are the three areas of oesophageal
constrictions. Half of the squamous cell carcinomas of
oesophagus occur in the middle third, followed by lower
third, and the upper third of oesophagus in that order of
frequency.
Grossly, 3 types of patterns are recognised (Fig. 20.4,B):
i)
Polypoid fungating type—is the most common form. It
appears as a cauliflower-like friable mass protruding into
the lumen.
ii) Ulcerating type—is the next common form. It looks
grossly like a necrotic ulcer with everted edges (Fig. 20.5,
A).
iii) Diffuse infiltrating type—appears as an annular,
stenosing narrowing of the lumen due to infiltration into
the wall of oesophagus.
Microscopically, majority of the squamous cell carcinomas
of the oesophagus are well-differentiated or moderately-
differentiated (Fig. 20.5, B). Prickle cells, keratin forma-
tion and epithelial pearls are commonly seen. However,
non-keratinising and anaplastic growth patterns can also
occur. An exophytic, slow-growing, extremely well-
differentiated variant, verrucous squamous cell carcinoma,
has also been reported in the oesophagus.
ADENOCARCINOMA. Adenocarcinoma of the
oesophagus constitutes less than 10% of primary
oesophageal cancer. It occurs predominantly in men in
their 4th to 5th decades. The common locations are lower
and middle third of the oesophagus. These tumours have
a strong and definite association with Barrett’s
oesophagus in which there are foci of gastric or intestinal
type of epithelium.
Grossly, oesophageal adenocarcinoma appears as
nodular, elevated mass in the lower oesophagus.
Microscopically, adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus can
have 3 patterns:
i)
Intestinal type—is the adenocarcinoma with a pattern
similar to that seen in adenocarcinoma of intestine or
stomach.
ii) Adenosquamous type—is the pattern in which there is
an irregular admixture of adenocarcinoma and squamous
cell carcinoma.
iii) Adenoid cystic type—is an uncommon variety and is
akin to similar growth in salivary gland i.e. a cribriform
appearance in an epithelial tumour.
Adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus must be
distinguished from adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia.
This is done by identifying normal oesophageal mucosa
on distal as well as proximal margin of the tumour.
OTHER CARCINOMAS. Besides the two main
histological types of oesophageal cancer, a few other
varieties are occasionally encountered. These are as follow:
i)
Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a tumour having
characteristics of squamous cell as well as mucus-secreting
carcinomas.
ii) Malignant melanoma is derived from melanoblasts in
the epithelium of the oesophagus.
iii) Oat cell carcinoma arises from argyrophil cells in the
basal layer of the epithelium.
iv) Undifferentiated carcinoma is an anaplastic carcinoma
which cannot be classified into any recognisable type of
carcinoma.
Figure 20.5

mucosal folds. There is a concentric circumferential thickening in the middle (arrow) causing narrowing of the lumen (arrow). The mucosal surface
is ulcerated. B, Photomicrograph shows whorls of anaplastic squamous cells invading the underlying soft tissues.

543
CHAPTER 20
The Gastrointestinal Tract
v) Carcinosarcoma consists of malignant epithelial as well
as sarcomatous components.
vi) Secondary tumours rarely occur in the oesophagus from
carcinomas of the breast, kidney and adrenals.
SPREAD. The oesophageal cancer spreads locally as well as
to distant sites.
i)
Local spread. This is the most important mode of spread
and is of great importance for surgical treatment. The local
spread may occur in the transverse as well as longitudinal
direction. The tumour may invade below into the stomach,
above into the hypopharynx, into the trachea resulting in
tracheo-oesophageal fistula, and may involve larynx causing
hoarseness. The tumour may invade the muscular wall of
the oesophagus and involve the mediastinum, lungs, bronchi,
pleura and aorta.
ii)  Lymphatic spread. Submucosal lymphatic permeation
may lead to multiple satellite nodules away from the main
tumour. Besides, the lymphatic spread may result in
metastases to the cervical, para-oesophageal, tracheo-
bronchial and subdiaphragmatic lymph nodes.
iii)  Haematogenous spread. Blood-borne metastases from
the oesophageal cancer are rare, probably because the death
occurs early due to invasion of important structures by other
modes of spread. However, metastatic deposits by
haematogenous route can occur in the lungs, liver and
adrenals.
STOMACH
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The stomach is ‘gland with cavity’, extending from its
junction with lower end of the oesophagus (cardia) to its
junction with the duodenum (pylorus). The lesser curvature
is inner concavity on the right, while the greater curvature is
the outer convexity on the left side of the stomach.
The stomach has 5 anatomical regions (Fig. 20.6):
1.
Cardia is the oesophagogastric junction and lacks the
sphincter.
2.
Fundus is the portion above the horizontal line drawn
across the oesophagogastric junction.
3.
Body is the middle portion of the stomach between the
fundus and the pyloric antrum.
4.
Pyloric antrum is the distal third of the stomach.
5.
Pylorus is the junction of distal end of the stomach with
the duodenum. It has powerful sphincter muscle.
The mucosal folds in the region of the body and the
fundus are loose (rugae), while the antral mucosa is
somewhat flattened. Gastric canal is the relatively fixed
portion of the pyloric antrum and the adjoining lesser
curvature; it is the site for numerous pathological changes
such as gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric carcinoma.
The stomach receives its blood supply from the left gastric
artery and the branches of the hepatic and splenic arteries
with widespread anastomoses. Numerous gastric lymphatics
which communicate freely with each other are also present.
The innervation of the stomach is by the vagi and branches
of the sympathetic which are connected with ganglia in the
muscular and submucous layers.
Histologically, the wall of the stomach consists of 4 layers—
serosa, muscularis, submucosa and mucosa.
1.
Serosa is derived from the peritoneum which is deficient
in the region of lesser and greater curvatures.
2.
Muscularis consists of 3 layers of smooth muscle fibres—
the outer longitudinal, the middle circular and the inner
oblique. Nerve plexuses and ganglion cells are present
between the longitudinal and circular layers of muscle. The
pyloric sphincter is the thickened circular muscle layer at
the gastroduodenal junction.
Figure 20.6
Anatomical subdivisions of the stomach correlated with histological appearance of gastric mucosa in different regions. D1, D2, D3
and D4 are the first to fourth parts of the duodenum.

544
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
3.
Submucosa is a layer of loose fibroconnective tissue
binding the mucosa to the muscularis loosely and contains
branches of blood vessels, lymphatics and nerve plexuses
and ganglion cells.
4.
Mucosa consists of 2 layers—superficial and deep.
Between the two layers is the lamina propria composed of
network of fibrocollagenic tissue with a few lymphocytes,
plasma cells, macrophages and eosinophils. The mucosa is
externally bounded by muscularis mucosae:
i)
Superficial layer.  It consists of a single layer of surface
epithelium composed of regular, mucin-secreting, tall
columnar cells with basal nuclei. There is a very rapid
turnover of these cells. These dip down at places to form
crypts (or pits or foveolae).
Cardiac mucosa is the transition zone between the oeso-
phageal squamous mucosa and the oxyntic mucosa of the
fundus and body with which it gradually merges.
Oxyntic mucosa lines both gastric fundus and body.
Antral mucosa lines the pyloric antrum.
ii) Deep layer: It consists of glands that open into the
bottom of the crypts. Depending upon the structure, these
glands are of 3 types:
a) Glands of the cardia are simple tubular or compound
tubulo-racemose, lined by mucin secreting cells. A few
endocrine cells and occasional parietal and chief cells are also
present.
b) Glands of the body-fundus are long, tubular and tightly
packed which may be coiled or dilated. There are 4 types of
cells present in the glands of body-fundic mucosa:
Parietal (Oxyntic) cells—are the most numerous and line
the superficial (upper) part of the glands. Parietal cells
are triangular in shape, have dark-staining nuclei and
eosinophilic cytoplasm. These cells are responsible for
production of hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice and
the blood group substances.
Chief (Peptic) cells—are the dominant cells in the deeper
(lower) parts of the glands. Their basal nuclei are large
with prominent nucleoli and the cytoplasm is coarsely
granular and basophilic. These cells secrete pepsin of the
gastric juice.
Mucin-secreting neck cells—are small and fewer. These
cells are present in the region of the narrow neck of the
gastric glands i.e. at the junction of the glands with the
pits.
Endocrine (Kulchitsky or Enterochromaffin) cells—are
widely distributed in the mucosa of all parts of the
alimentary tract and are described later (page 561).
c)
Glands of the pylorus are much longer than the body-fundic
glands. These are simple tubular glands which are often
coiled. They are lined mainly by small, granular, mucin-
secreting cells resembling neck cells and occasional parietal
cells but no chief cells. Gastrin-producing G-cells are present
predominantly in the region of antropyloric mucosa, with a
small number of these cells in the crypts and Brunner’s glands
of the proximal duodenum.
The secretory products of the gastric mucosa are the
gastric juice and the intrinsic factor, required for absorption of
vitamin B12. Gastric juice consists of hydrochloric acid,
pepsin, mucin and electrolytes like Na+, K+, HCO’3 and Cl–.
Hydrochloric acid is produced by the parietal (oxyntic) cells
by the interaction of Cl’ ions of the arterial blood with water
and carbon dioxide in the presence of the enzyme, carbonic
anhydrase. The degree of gastric activity is correlated with
the ‘total parietal cell mass’. Injection of histamine can
stimulate the production of acid component of the gastric
juice, while the pepsin-secreting chief cells do not respond
to histamine. Physiologically, the gastric secretions are
stimulated by the food itself.
The control of gastric secretions chiefly occurs in one of the
following 3 ways:
1.
Cephalic phase—is stimulated by the sight, smell, taste
or even thought of food. A neural reflex is initiated via
branches of the vagus nerve that promotes the release of
hydrochloric acid, pepsinogen and mucus.
2.
Gastric phase—is triggered by the mechanical and
chemical stimuli.
i)
Mechanical stimulation comes from stretching of the wall
of the stomach and conveying neural messages to the medulla
for gastric secretion.
ii) Chemical stimulation is by digested proteins, amino acids,
bile salts and alcohol which act on gastrin-producing G cells.
Gastrin then passes into the blood stream and on return to
the stomach promotes the release of gastric juice.
3.
Intestinal phase—is triggered by the entry of protein-
rich food in the small intestine. An intestinal hormone capable
of stimulating gastric secretion is probably released into the
blood stream.
GASTRIC ANALYSIS
In various diseases of the stomach, the laboratory tests to
measure gastric secretions (consisting of gastric acid, pepsin,
mucus and intrinsic factor) and serum gastrin are of
particular significance (Table 20.1).

CHAPTER 20
The Gastrointestinal Tract
principle of measuring basal acid output (BAO) and maximal
acid output (MAO) produced by the stomach under the
influence of a variety of stimulants, and then comparing the
readings of BAO and MAO with the normal values.
Quantitative analysis is performed after an overnight fast.
The stomach is intubated and gastric secretion collected in 4
consecutive 15-minute intervals. This unstimulated, one-hour
collection after titration for the acid concentration in it, is
called BAO, expressed in mEq 1-hour. Subsequently, the
stomach is stimulated to secrete maximal acid which is
similarly collected for one hour and the acid content called
as MAO, expressed in mEq-1-hour. Two highest 15-minute
acid outputs are added and then multiplied by 2; this gives
the peak acid output (PAO).
The tests for gastric acid secretion are named after the
stimulants used for MAO. Some of the commonly used
substances are as under:
i)
HISTAMINE. Histamine was the first standard stimulant
used for gastric acid secretion test. Subcutaneous injection
of histamine phosphate (0.04 mg/kg body weight) is given
with simultaneous administration of antihistaminic agent to
prevent the untoward side-effects of histamine.
ii) HISTALOG (BETAZOLE). Subcutaneous injection of
histalog (1-15 mg/kg body weight) is preferable over
histamine due to fewer undesired side-effects and no need
for administration of antihistaminic agent.
iii) PENTAGASTRIN (PEPTAVLON). Pentagastrin is
currently the most preferred agent administered in the dose
of 6 μg/kg body weight. Its activity is similar to gastrin.
iv) INSULIN MEAL (HOLLANDER TEST). This test is
based on the fact that in a state of hypoglycaemia, direct vagal
action on the parietal cell mass is responsible for acid
secretion. Hypoglycaemia induced by intravenous insulin
(15 IU soluble insulin) can be used as a test for evaluating
the completeness of vagotomy. No increase in acid
production should occur if the vagal resection is complete.
v) TUBELESS ANALYSIS. A resin-bound dye, diagnex
blue, is given orally. The release of dye by the action of gastric
acid and its appearance in the urine indicates the presence
of gastric acid. The test can be repeated after giving stimulant
of gastric secretion.
SIGNIFICANCE
Normal value for BAO is 1.5-2.0 mEq 1-hour and for MAO is
12-40 mEq 1-hour. In gastric ulcer, the values of BAO and
MAO are usually normal or slightly below normal.
Higher values are found in:
duodenal ulcer;
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma); and
anastomotic ulcer.
Low value or achlorhydria are observed in:
pernicious anaemia (atrophic gastritis); and
achlorhydria in the presence of gastric ulcer is highly
suggestive of gastric malignancy.
2. Tests for Pepsin
Pepsin inhibitors are used for analysis of pepsin derived from
pepsinogen for research purposes. The levels of pepsin are
low in atrophic gastritis.
3. Tests for Mucus
Protein content of gastric mucus is measured, normal value
being 1.8 mg/ml. The level is increased in chronic
hypertrophic gastritis (Ménétrier’s disease).
4. Test for Intrinsic Factor
Intrinsic factor (IF) is essential for vitamin B12 absorption from
the small intestine. In its absence, the absorption of vitamin
B12 is impaired as occurs in chronic atrophic gastritis and
gastric atrophy. Schilling test is used for evaluation of patients
with suspected pernicious anaemia but can also be used as a
diagnostic test for pancreatic insufficiency resulting in
impaired absorption of vitamin B12 since gastric R-binder
protein is not cleared from intrinsic factor due to reduced
pancreatic proteolytic activity. Schilling test is discussed on
page 308.
B. TESTS FOR GASTRIN
Circulating gastrin secreted by G-cells present in the
antropyloric and proximal duodenal mucosa is normally
0-200 pg/ml. It can be tested by the following methods:
1. Serum Gastrin Levels
Radioimmunoassay (RIA) is the commonly used method of
measurement of serum gastrin levels. Normal fasting values
are 20-150 pg/ml. The levels are high in:
atrophic gastritis (with low gastric acid secretion);
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome or gastrinoma (with high
gastric acid secretion); and
following surgery on the stomach.
2. Gastrin Provocation Tests
These tests are used to differentiate between hyper-
gastrinaemia and gastric acid hypersecretion as follows:
i)
SECRETIN TEST. An intravenous injection of secretin
(1 unit/kg body weight) is given. If the serum gastrin levels
rise by more than 50% of basal value in 5-15 minutes, it is
diagnostic of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma). This
rise does not occur in other conditions.
ii) CALCIUM INFUSION TEST. Intravenous infusion of
calcium (5 mg/kg per hour) is given for 3 hour. Rise in serum
gastrin levels by more than 50% of basal value is diagnostic
of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma).
CONGENITAL ANOMALIES
Pancreatic Heterotopia
Heterotopic pancreatic tissue may present clinically as a
gastric mass or may be an incidental finding. Symptomatic
cases may present in newborn or later in life.
Grossly, it is seen as a mass projecting into the gastric
lumen, generally in the region of submucosa  and less often
in the muscular layer. In most cases, the mass is located in
the region of antrum or pylorus.
Microscopically, both normal mature pancreatic acinar and
ductal tissue are seen. Islets are seen in about a third of
cases.

546
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Pyloric Stenosis
Hypertrophy and narrowing of the pyloric lumen occurs
predominantly in male children as a congenital defect
(infantile pyloric stenosis). The adult form is rarely seen, either
as a result of late manifestation of mild congenital anomaly
or may be acquired type due to inflammatory fibrosis or
invasion by tumours.
ETIOLOGY. The exact cause of congenital (infantile) pyloric
stenosis is not known but it appears to have familial
clustering and recessive genetic origin. The acquired (adult)
pyloric stenosis is related to antral gastritis, and tumours in
the region (gastric carcinoma, lymphoma, pancreatic
carcinoma).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly and micros-
copically, there is hypertrophy as well as hyperplasia of
the circular layer of muscularis in the pyloric sphincter
accompanied by mild degree of fibrosis (Fig. 20.7).
CLINICAL FEATURES. The patient, usually a first born
male infant 3 to 6 weeks old, presents with the following
clinical features:
1.
Vomiting, which may be projectile and occasionally
contains bile or blood.
2.
Visible peristalsis, usually noticed from left to right side
of the upper abdomen.
3.
Palpable lump, better felt after an episode of vomiting.
4.
Constipation.
5.
Loss of weight.
MISCELLANEOUS ACQUIRED CONDITIONS
Bezoars
Bezoars are foreign bodies in the stomach, usually in patients
with mental illness who chew these substances. Some of the
common bezoars are as follows:
Trichobezoars composed of a ball of hair.
Phytobezoars composed of vegetable fibres, seeds or fruit
skin.
Trichophytobezoars combining both hair and vegetable
matter.
Acute Dilatation
Sudden and enormous dilatation of the stomach by gas or
fluids due to paralysis of the gastric musculature may occur
after abdominal operations, generalised peritonitis, and, in
pyloric stenosis.
Gastric Rupture
The stomach may rupture rarely and prove fatal e.g. due to
blunt trauma, external cardiac massage, ingestion of heavy
meal or large quantity of liquid intake like beer.
INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS
The two important inflammatory conditions of the stomach
are gastritis and peptic ulcer. Rarely, stomach may be involved
in tuberculosis, sarcoidosis and Crohn’s disease.
GASTRITIS
The term ‘gastritis’ is commonly employed for any clinical
condition with upper abdominal discomfort like indigestion
or dyspepsia in which the specific clinical signs and
radiological abnormalities are absent. The condition is of
great importance due to its relationship with peptic ulcer
and gastric cancer. Broadly speaking, gastritis may be of 2
types—acute and chronic. Chronic gastritis can further be of
various types.
A simple classification of various types of gastritis is
presented in Table 20.2.
Acute Gastritis
Acute gastritis is a transient acute inflammatory involvement
of the stomach, mainly mucosa.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. A variety of etiologic agents have
been implicated in the causation of acute gastritis. These are
as follows:
1.
Diet and personal habits:
Highly spiced food
Excessive alcohol consumption
Malnutrition
Heavy smoking.
2.
Infections:
Bacterial infections e.g. Helicobacter pylori, diphtheria,
salmonellosis, pneumonia, staphylococcal food poisoning.

transverse section of the stomach showing hypertrophy of the circular

CHAPTER 20
The Gastrointestinal Tract
Viral infections e.g. viral hepatitis, influenza, infectious
mononucleosis.
3.
Drugs:
Intake of drugs like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, cortisone, phenylbutazone,
indomethacin, preparations of iron, chemotherapeutic
agents.
4.
Chemical and physical agents:
Intake of corrosive chemicals such as caustic soda, phenol,
lysol
Gastric irradiation
Freezing.
5.
Severe stress:
Emotional factors like shock, anger, resentment etc.
Extensive burns
Trauma
Surgery.
The mucosal injury and subsequent acute inflammation
in acute gastritis occurs by one of the following mechanisms:
1.
Reduced blood flow, resulting in mucosal hypoperfusion
due to ischaemia.
2.
Increased acid secretion and its accumulation due to H.
pylori infection resulting in damage to epithelial barrier.
3.
Decreased production of bicarbonate buffer.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the gastric
mucosa is oedematous with abundant mucus and
haemorrhagic spots.
Microscopically, depending upon the stage, there is
variable amount of oedema and infiltration by neutrophils
in the lamina propria. In acute haemorrhagic and erosive
gastritis, the mucosa is sloughed off and there are
haemorrhages on the surface.
Chronic Gastritis
Chronic gastritis is the commonest histological change
observed in biopsies from the stomach. The microscopic
change is usually poorly correlated to the symptomatology,
as the change is observed in about 35% of endoscopically
normal mucosal biopsies. The condition occurs more
frequently with advancing age; average age for symptomatic
chronic gastritis being 45 years which corresponds well with
the age incidence of gastric ulcer.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. In the absence of clear etiology of
chronic gastritis, a number of etiologic factors have been
implicated. All the causative factors of acute gastritis
described above may result in chronic gastritis too. Recurrent
attacks of acute gastritis may result in chronic gastritis. Some
additional causes are as under:
1.
Reflux of duodenal contents into the stomach, especially in
cases which have undergone surgical intervention in the
region of pylorus.
2.
Infection with H. pylori is strongly implicated in the
etiology of chronic gastritis and is more common.
3.
Associated disease of the stomach and duodenum, such as
gastric or duodenal ulcer, gastric carcinoma.
4.
Chronic hypochromic anaemia, especially associated with
atrophic gastritis.
5.
Immunological factors such as autoantibodies to gastric
parietal cells in atrophic gastritis and autoantibodies against
intrinsic factor.
The mechanism of chronic gastric injury by any of the
etiologic agents is by cytotoxic effect of the injurious agent
on the gastric mucosal epithelium, thus breaking the barrier
and then inciting the inflammatory response.
CLASSIFICATION. Based on the type of mucosa affected
(i.e. cardiac, body, pyloric, antral or transitional), a
clinicopathologic classification has been proposed
(Table 20.2).
1.
Type A gastritis (Autoimmune gastritis). Type A gas-
tritis involves mainly the body-fundic mucosa. It is also called
autoimmune gastritis due to the presence of circulating
antibodies and is sometimes associated with other
autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and
Addison’s disease. As a result of the antibodies against
parietal cells and intrinsic factor, there is depletion of parietal
cells and impaired secretion of intrinsic factor. These changes
may lead to significant gastric atrophy where intestinal
metaplasia may occur, and a small proportion of these
patients may develop pernicious anaemia. Due to depletion
of gastric acid-producing mucosal area, there is hypo- or
achlorhydria, and hyperplasia of gastrin-producing G cells
in the antrum resulting in hypergastrinaemia.
2.
Type B gastritis (H. pylori-related). Type B gastritis
mainly involves the region of antral mucosa and is more
common. It is also called hypersecretory gastritis due to
excessive secretion of acid, commonly due to infection with
H. pylori. These patients may have associated peptic ulcer.
Unlike type A gastritis, this form of gastritis has no
autoimmune basis nor has association with other
autoimmune diseases.
3.
Type AB gastritis (Mixed gastritis, Environmental
gastritis, Chronic atrophic gastritis). Type AB gastritis affects
the mucosal region of A as well as B types (body-fundic and
antral mucosa). This is the most common type of gastritis in
all age groups. It is also called environmental gastritis
because a number of unidentified environmental factors have
been implicated in its etiopathogenesis. Chronic atrophic
gastritis is also used synonymously with type AB gastritis
because in advanced stage, there is progression from chronic
superficial gastritis to chronic atrophic gastritis, characterised
by mucosal atrophy and metaplasia of intestinal or
pseudopyloric type.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the features of all
forms of gastritis are inconclusive. The gastric mucosa may
be normal, atrophied, or oedematous.
Histologically, criteria for categorisation are based on the
following:
i)
Extent of inflammatory changes in the mucosa (i.e.
superficial or deep).

548
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
ii) Activity of inflammation (i.e. quiscent or active; acute
or chronic).
iii) Presence of and type of metaplasia (i.e. intestinal or
pseudopyloric).
Based on above, following simple morphologic classi-
fication has been proposed:
1.
Chronic superficial gastritis
2.
Chronic atrophic gastritis
3.
Gastric atrophy
4.
Chronic hypertrophic gastritis (Ménétrier’s disease)
5.
Uncommon forms of chronic gastritis.
However, Sydney system of recording of histologic
changes in gastritis is more acceptable since it takes into
account following multiple parameters as well:
i) Etiology (H. pylori, autoimmune, NSAIDs, infections).
ii) Location (pangastritis, predominant antral, predominant
body-fundic).
iii) Morphology (depth of inflammation—superficial or
deep, severity of inflammation, type of inflammation,
atrophy, metaplasia).
iv) Some special features (e.g. granulomas, eosinophilic
gastritis, erosions, necrosis, haemorrhages).
1.
CHRONIC SUPERFICIAL GASTRITIS. As the name
suggests there is inflammatory infiltrate consisting of
plasma cells and lymphocytes in the superficial layer of
the gastric mucosa, but there are no histological changes in
the deep layer of mucosa containing gastric glands. Chronic
superficial gastritis may resolve completely or may
progress to chronic gastric atrophy.
H. pylori, a spiral-shaped bacteria, was first reported
by Warren and Marshall in Australia in 1984 as inhabitant
of the acid environment of the stomach causing gastritis.
After intial skepticism, numerous workers subsequently
verified its association with gastritis and peptic ulcer
(Warren and Marshall shared Nobel Prize in medicine in
2005 for their discovery). It is now known that H. pylori is
causative for almost all active cases of chronic superficial
gastritis and about 65% of quiscent cases. The organism
is identified on the epithelial layer on the luminal surface
and does not invade the mucosa (Fig. 20.8). It is not seen
on areas with intestinal metaplasia. H. pylori gastritis can
be diagnosed by the following techniques:
i) Invasive tests (Endoscopic biopsy):
a) histologic examination combined with special stains for
identification of microorganism: Giemsa, Steiner silver or
Warthin-Starry stains;
b) biopsy urease test which is quick and simple but not
fully sensitive; and
c) culture of the microorganism that helps in determining
specific antibiotic sensitivity.
ii) Non-invasive tests:
a) serologic tests (Immunoblot, ELISA) which are cheap
and convenient but may not be helpful in early follow-up
cases; and
b) 14C urea breath test.
Although most patients of chronic superficial gastritis
due to H. pylori remain asymptomatic, they may develop
chronic atrophic gastritis, gastric atrophy, peptic ulcer
disease. H. pylori infection is now considered an
independent risk factor for gastric cancer: 3-6 fold
increased risk for gastric adenocarcinoma and 6-50 times
risk of MALT lymphoma (Fig. 20.9).
2.
CHRONIC ATROPHIC GASTRITIS. In this stage,
there is inflammatory cell infiltrate in the deeper layer of the
mucosa and atrophy of the epithelial elements including
destruction of the glands. Two types of metaplasia are
commonly associated with atrophic gastritis:
i)
Intestinal metaplasia. Intestinal metaplasia is more
common and involves antral mucosa more frequently.
Characteristic histologic feature is the presence of
intestinal type mucus-goblet cells; Paneth cells and
endocrine cells may also be present. Parietal cells are very

549
CHAPTER 20
The Gastrointestinal Tract
few or absent (Fig. 20.10). Intestinal metaplasia, focal or
extensive, in atrophic gastritis is significant because its
incidence is high in populations having high prevalence
rate of gastric cancer like in Japan. However, areas of
intestinal metaplasia are not colonised by H. pylori.
ii) Pseudopyloric metaplasia. It involves the body glands
which are replaced by proliferated mucus neck cells,
conforming in appearance to normal pyloric glands. Its
significance is not known.
3.
GASTRIC ATROPHY. In this, there is thinning of the
gastric mucosa with loss of glands but no inflammation
though lymphoid aggregates may be present.
4.
CHRONIC HYPERTROPHIC GASTRITIS (MÉNÉ-
TRIER’S DISEASE). This is an uncommon condition
characterised pathologically by enormous thickening of
gastric rugal folds resembling cerebral convolutions,
affecting mainly the region of fundic-body mucosa and
characteristically sparing antral mucosa. The patients
present with dyspepsia, haematemesis, melaena or
protein-losing enteropathy.
Histologically, the gastric pits are elongated and are
tortuous. The mucosa is markedly thickened and parts of
muscularis mucosae may extend into the thickened folds.
Epithelium-lined cysts are commonly seen in the
glandular layer. Inflammatory infiltrate is usually mild
but lymphoid follicles may be present. The condition is
considered significant in view of the risk of developing
cancer.
5.
MISCELLANEOUS FORMS OF CHRONIC GAS-
TRITIS. A few other types of gastritis which do not fit
into the description of the types of gastritis described
above are as under:
i)
Eosinophilic gastritis. This condition is characterised
by diffuse thickening of the pyloric antrum due to oedema
and extensive infiltration by eosinophils in all the layers
of the wall of antrum. Eosinophilic gastritis probably has
an allergic basis.
iii) Chronic follicular gastritis. This is a variant of chronic
atrophic gastritis in which numerous lymphoid follicles
are present in the mucosa and submucosa of the stomach.
iv) Haemorrhagic (Erosive) gastritis. In this condition,
there are superficial erosions and mucosal haemorrhages,
usually following severe haematemesis. The causes for
such erosions and haemorrhages are duodenal-gastric
reflux, administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), portal hypertension.
v) Granulomatous gastritis. Rarely, granulomas may be
present in the gastric mucosa such as in tuberculosis,
sarcoidosis, Crohn’s disease, syphilis, various mycoses,
and as a reaction to endogenous substance or foreign
material.
PEPTIC ULCERS
Peptic ulcers are the areas of degeneration and necrosis of
gastrointestinal mucosa exposed to acid-peptic secretions.
Though they can occur at any level of the alimentary tract
that is exposed to hydrochloric acid and pepsin, they occur
most commonly (98-99%) in either the duodenum or the
stomach in the ratio of 4:1. Each of the two main types may
be acute or chronic.

metaplasia.

550
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Acute Peptic (Stress) Ulcers
Acute peptic ulcers or stress ulcers are multiple, small
mucosal erosions, seen most commonly in the stomach but
occasionally involving the duodenum.
ETIOLOGY. These ulcers occur following severe stress. The
causes are as follows:
i)
Psychological stress
ii) Physiological stress as in the following:
Shock
Severe trauma
Septicaemia
Extensive burns (Curling’s ulcers in the posterior aspect
of the first part of the duodenum).
Intracranial lesions (Cushing’s ulcers developing from
hyperacidity following excessive vagal stimulation).
Drug intake (e.g. aspirin, steroids, butazolidine,
indomethacin).
Local irritants (e.g. alcohol, smoking, coffee etc).
PATHOGENESIS. It is not clear how the mucosal erosions
occur in stress ulcers because actual hypersecretion of gastric
acid is demonstrable in only Cushing’s ulcers occurring from
intracranial conditions such as due to brain trauma,
intracranial surgery and brain tumours. In all other etiologic
factors, gastric acid secretion is normal or below normal. In
these conditions, the possible hypotheses for genesis of stress
ulcers are as under:
1.
Ischaemic hypoxic injury to the mucosal cells.
2.
Depletion of the gastric mucus ‘barrier’ rendering the
mucosa susceptible to attack by acid-peptic secretions.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, acute stress
ulcers are multiple (more than three ulcers in 75% of cases).
They are more common anywhere in the stomach,
followed in decreasing frequency by occurrence in the first
part of duodenum. They may be oval or circular in shape,
usually less than 1 cm in diameter.
Microscopically, the stress ulcers are shallow and do not
invade the muscular layer. The margins and base may
show some inflammatory reaction depending upon the
duration of the ulcers. These ulcers commonly heal by
complete re-epithelialisation without leaving any scars.
Complications such as haemorrhage and perforation may
occur.
Chronic Peptic Ulcers (Gastric and Duodenal Ulcers)
If not specified, chronic peptic ulcers would mean gastric
and duodenal ulcers, the two major forms of ‘peptic ulcer
disease’ of the upper GI tract in which the acid-pepsin
secretions are implicated in their pathogenesis. Peptic ulcers
are common in the present-day life of the industrialised and
civilised world.
Gastric and duodenal ulcers represent two distinct
diseases as far as their etiology, pathogenesis and clinical
features are concerned. However, morphological findings in
both are similar and quite diagnostic. The features of gastric
and duodenal peptic ulcers are described together below
while their contrasting features are presented in Table 20.3.
INCIDENCE. Peptic ulcers are more frequent in middle-aged
adults. The peak incidence for duodenal ulcer is 5th decade,
while for gastric ulcer it is a decade later (6th decade).
Duodenal as well as gastric ulcers are more common in males
than in females. Duodenal ulcer is almost four times more
common than gastric ulcer; the overall incidence of
gastroduodenal ulcers being approximately 10% of the male
population.
ETIOLOGY. The immediate cause of peptic ulcer disease is
disturbance in normal protective mucosal ‘barrier’ by acid-
pepsin, resulting in digestion of the mucosa. However, in
contrast to duodenal ulcers, the patients of gastric ulcer have
low-to-normal gastric acid secretions, though true achlorhydria in
response to stimulants never occurs in benign gastric ulcer.
Besides, 10-20% patients of gastric ulcer may have coexistent
duodenal ulcer as well. Thus, the etiology of peptic ulcers
possibly may not be explained on the basis of a single factor
but is multifactorial. These factors are discussed below but
the first two—H. pylori gastritis and NSAIDs-induced injury
are considered most important.
1.
Helicobacter pylori gastritis. About 15-20% cases infected
with H. pylori in the antrum develop duodenal ulcer in their
life time while gastric colonisation by H. pylori never deve-
lops ulceration and remain asymptomatic. H. pylori can be
identified in mucosal samples by histologic examination,
culture and serology as discussed  on page 548.
2.
NSAIDs-induced mucosal injury. Non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs are most commonly used medications
in the developed countries and are responsible for direct
toxicity, endothelial damage and epithelial injury to both
gastric as well as duodenal mucosa.
3. Acid-pepsin secretions. There is conclusive evidence that
some level of acid-pepsin secretion is essential for the
development of duodenal as well as gastric ulcer. Peptic
ulcers never occur in association with pernicious anaemia in
which there are no acid and pepsin-secreting parietal and
chief cells respectively.
4.
Gastritis. Some degree of gastritis is always present in
the region of gastric ulcer, though it is not clear whether it is
the cause or the effect of ulcer. Besides, the population
distribution pattern of gastric ulcer is similar to that of chronic
gastritis.
5.
Other local irritants. Pyloric antrum and lesser curvature
of the stomach are the sites most exposed for longer periods
to local irritants and thus are the common sites for occurrence
of gastric ulcers. Some of the local irritating substances
implicated in the etiology of peptic ulcers are heavily spiced
foods, alcohol, cigarette smoking, unbuffered aspirin.
6.
Dietary factors. Nutritional deficiencies have been
regarded as etiologic factors in peptic ulcers e.g. occurrence
of gastric ulcer in poor socioeconomic strata, higher incidence
of duodenal ulcer in parts of South India. However,
malnutrition does not appear to have any causative role in
peptic ulceration in European countries and the U.S.

551
CHAPTER 20
The Gastrointestinal Tract
7.
Psychological factors. Psychological stress, anxiety,
fatigue and ulcer-type personality may exacerbate as well
as predispose to peptic ulcer disease.
8.
Genetic factors. People with blood group O appear to be
more prone to develop peptic ulcers than those with other
blood groups. Genetic influences appear to have greater role
in duodenal ulcers as evidenced by their occurrence in
families, monozygotic twins and association with HLA-B5
antigen.
9.
Hormonal factors. Secretion of certain hormones by
tumours is associated with peptic ulceration e.g. elaboration
of gastrin by islet-cell tumour in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome,
endocrine secretions in hyperplasia and adenomas of
parathyroid glands, adrenal cortex and anterior pituitary.
10. Miscellaneous. Duodenal ulcers have been observed to
occur in association with various other conditions such as
alcoholic cirrhosis, chronic renal failure, hyperpara-
thyroidism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and
chronic pancreatitis.
PATHOGENESIS. Although the role of various etiologic
factors just described is well known in ulcerogenesis, two
most important factors in peptic ulcer are as under:
Exposure of mucosa to gastric acid and pepsin secretion.
Strong etiologic association with H. pylori infection.
There are distinct differences in the pathogenetic
mechanisms involved in duodenal and gastric ulcers as
under:
Duodenal ulcer. There is conclusive evidence to support the
role of high acid-pepsin secretions in the causation of
duodenal ulcers. Besides this, a few other noteworthy
features in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcers are as follows:
TABLE 20.3: Distinguishing Features of Two Major Forms of Peptic Ulcers.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
1.
There is generally hypersecretion of gastric acid into the
fasting stomach at night which takes place under the
influence of vagal stimulation. There is high basal as well as
maximal acid output (BAO and MAO) in response to various
stimuli.
2.
Patients of duodenal ulcer have rapid emptying of the
stomach so that the food which normally buffers and
neutralises the gastric acid, passes down into the small
intestine, leaving the duodenal mucosa exposed to the
aggressive action of gastric acid.
3.
Helicobacter gastritis caused by H. pylori is seen in 95-100%
cases of duodenal ulcers. The underlying mechanisms are
as under:
i)
Gastric mucosal defense is broken by bacterial elaboration
of urease, protease, catalase and phospholipase.
ii) Host factors: H. pylori-infected mucosal epithelium releases
proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and tumour
necrosis factor-α, all of which incite intense inflammatory
reaction.
iii) Bacterial factors: Epithelial injury is also induced by
cytotoxin-associated gene protein (CagA), while vacuolating
cytotoxin (VacA) induces elaboration of cytokines.
Gastric ulcer. The pathogenesis of gastric ulcer is mainly
explained on the basis of impaired gastric mucosal defenses
against acid-pepsin secretions. Some other features in the
pathogenesis of gastric ulcer are as follows:
1.
Hyperacidity may occur in gastric ulcer due to increased
serum gastrin levels in response to ingested food in an atonic
stomach.
2
However, many patients of gastric ulcer have low-to-
normal gastric acid levels. Ulcerogenesis in such patients is
explained on the basis of damaging influence of other factors
such as gastritis, bile reflux, cigarette smoke etc.
3.
The normally protective gastric mucus ‘barrier’ against
acid-pepsin is deranged in gastric ulcer. There is depletion
in the quantity as well as quality of gastric mucus. One of
the mechanisms for its depletion is colonisation of the gastric
mucosa by H. pylori seen in 75-80% patients of gastric ulcer.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Gross and microscopic
changes in gastric and duodenal ulcers are similar and
quite characteristic. Gastric ulcers are found predominantly
along the lesser curvature in the region of pyloric antrum,
more commonly on the posterior than the anterior wall.
Most duodenal ulcers are found in the first part of the
duodenum, usually immediate post-pyloric, more
commonly on the anterior than the posterior wall.
Uncommon locations include ulcer in the cardia, marginal
ulcer and in the Meckel’s diverticulum (Fig. 20.11).
Grossly, typical peptic ulcers are commonly solitary (80%),
small (1-2.5 cm in diameter), round to oval and
characteristically ‘punched out’. Benign ulcers usually
have flat margins in level with the surrounding mucosa.
The mucosal folds converge towards the ulcer. The ulcers
may vary in depth from being superficial (confined to
mucosa) to deep ulcers (penetrating into the muscular
layer) (Fig. 20.12). In about 10-20% of cases, gastric and
duodenal ulcers are coexistent. Vast majority of the peptic
ulcers are benign. Chronic duodenal ulcer never turns
malignant, while chronic gastric ulcer may develop
carcinoma in less than 1% of cases. Malignant gastric ulcers
are larger, bowl-shaped with elevated and indurated
mucosa at the margin (Fig. 20.13).
Microscopically, chronic peptic ulcers have 4 histological
zones. From within outside, these are as under (Fig. 20.14):
1.
Necrotic zone—lies in the floor of the ulcer and is
composed of fibrinous exudate containing necrotic debris
and a few leucocytes.
2.
Superficial exudative zone—lies underneath the necrotic
zone. The tissue elements here show coagulative necrosis
giving eosinophilic, smudgy appearance with nuclear
debris.
3.
Granulation tissue zone—is seen merging into the necro-
tic zone. It is composed of nonspecific inflammatory
infiltrate and proliferating capillaries.
4.
Zone of cicatrisation—is seen merging into thick layer
of granulation tissue. It is composed of dense fibrocolla-
genic scar tissue over which granulation tissue rests.
Thrombosed or sclerotic arteries may cross the ulcer which
on erosion may result in haemorrhage.

CHAPTER 20
The Gastrointestinal Tract
COMPLICATIONS. Acute and subacute peptic ulcers
usually heal without leaving any visible scar. However,
healing of chronic, larger and deeper ulcers may result in
complications. These are as follows:
1.
Obstruction. Development of fibrous scar at or near the
pylorus results in pyloric stenosis. In the case of healed
duodenal ulcer, it causes duodenal stenosis. Healed ulcers
along the lesser curvatures may produce ‘hourglass’
deformity due to fibrosis and contraction.
2.
Haemorrhage. Minor bleeding by erosion of small blood
vessels in the base of an ulcer occurs in all the ulcers and can
be detected by testing the stool for occult blood. Chronic
blood loss may result in iron deficiency anaemia. Severe
bleeding may cause ‘coffee ground’ vomitus or melaena. A
penetrating chronic ulcer may erode a major artery (e.g. left
gastric, gastroduodenal or splenic artery) and cause a massive
and severe hematemesis and sometimes death.
3.
Perforation. A perforated peptic ulcer is an acute abdo-
minal emergency. Perforation occurs more commonly in
chronic duodenal ulcers than chronic gastric ulcers.
Following sequelae may result:
i)
On perforation the contents escape into the lesser sac or
into the peritoneal cavity, causing acute peritonitis.
ii) Air escapes from the stomach and lies between the liver
and the diaphragm giving the characteristic radiological
appearance of air under the diaphragm.
iii) Subphrenic abscess between the liver and the diaphragm
may develop due to infection.
iv) Perforation may extend to involve the adjacent organs e.g.
the liver and pancreas.
4.
Malignant transformation. The dictum ‘cancers ulcerate
but ulcers rarely cancerate’ holds true for most peptic ulcers.
A chronic duodenal ulcer never turns malignant, while less
than 1% of chronic gastric ulcers may transform into
carcinoma.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Peptic ulcers are remitting and
relapsing lesions. Their chronic and recurrent behaviour is
summed up the saying: ‘once a peptic ulcer patient, always a
peptic ulcer patient.’ The two major forms of chronic peptic
ulcers show variations in clinical features which are as
follows:
1.
Age. The peak incidence of duodenal ulcer is in 5th
decade while that for gastric ulcer is a decade later.
2.
People at risk. Duodenal ulcer occurs more commonly
in people faced with more stress and strain of life (e.g.
executives, leaders), while gastric ulcer is seen more often in
labouring groups.
3.
Periodicity. The attacks in gastric ulcers last from 2-6
weeks, with interval of freedom from 1-6 months. The attacks
of duodenal ulcer, are classically worsened by ‘work, worry
and weather.’
4.
Pain. In gastric ulcer, epigastric pain occurs immediately
or within 2 hours after food and never occurs at night. In
duodenal ulcer, pain is severe, occurs late at night (‘hunger
pain’) and is usually relieved by food.

gastric ulcer (B).

debris, ulceration and inflammation on the mucosal surface.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
5.
Vomiting. Vomiting which relieves the pain is a conspi-
cuous feature in patients of gastric ulcer. Duodenal ulcer
patients rarely have vomiting but instead get heart-burn
(retrosternal pain) and ‘water brash’ (burning fluid into the
mouth).
6.
Haematemesis and melaena. Haematemesis and
melaena occur in gastric ulcers in the ratio of 60:40, while in
duodenal ulcers in the ratio of 40:60. Both may occur together
more commonly in duodenal ulcer than in gastric ulcer
patients.
7.
Appetite. The gastric ulcer patients, though have good
appetite but are afraid to eat, while duodenal ulcer patients
have very good appetite.
8.
Diet. Patients of gastric ulcer commonly get used to a
bland diet consisting of milk, eggs etc and avoid taking fried
foods, curries and heavily spiced foods. In contrast, duodenal
ulcer patients usually take all kinds of diets.
9.
Weight. Loss of weight is a common finding in gastric
ulcer patients while patients of duodenal ulcer tend to gain
weight due to frequent ingestion of milk to avoid pain.
10. Deep tenderness. Deep tenderness is demonstrable in
both types of peptic ulcers. In the case of gastric ulcer it is in
the midline of the epigastrium, while in the duodenal ulcer
it is in the right hypochondrium.
HAEMATEMESIS AND MELAENA OF GASTRIC ORIGIN
In continuity with the discussion on peptic ulcers which are
the commonest cause of haematemesis and melaena, it is
worthwhile listing various causes of haematemesis of gastric
origin (causes of haematemesis of oesophageal origin are
already given on page 539).
i) Chronic peptic ulcers (gastric as well as duodenal)
ii) Acute peptic ulcers (stress ulcers)
iii) Multiple gastric and duodenal erosions
iv) Carcinoma of the stomach
v) Peptic ulcer in Meckel’s diverticulum
vi) Mallory-Weiss syndrome
vii) Anaemias
viii) Purpuras
ix) Haemophilia.
TUMOURS AND TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS
The various types of tumour-like lesions (polyps) and benign
and malignant tumours of the stomach are given in
Table 20.4.
A. TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS (POLYPS)
Hyperplastic (Inflammatory) Polyps
Hyperplastic or inflammatory polyps are regenerative, non-
neoplastic lesions which are the most common type (90%).
They may be single or multiple and are more often located
in the pyloric antrum.
Grossly, the lesions may be sessile or pedunculated, 1 cm
or larger in size, smooth and soft. The surface may be
ulcerated or haemorrhagic.
Microscopically, they are composed of irregular
hyperplastic glands, which may show cystic change. The
lining epithelium is mostly superficial gastric type but
antral glands, chief cells and parietal cells may be present.
These lesions do not have cellular atypia and do not have
malignant potential.
Hamartomatous Polyps
Hamartomatous polyps are not true neoplasms but are
malformations. They are of various types such as gastric
polyps of the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (page 582), juvenile
polyp, pancreatic heterotopia, heterotopia of Brunner’s
glands and inflammatory fibroid polyps (eosinophilic
granulomatous polyps).
B. BENIGN TUMOURS
Adenomas (Adenomatous or Neoplastic Polyps)
Adenomas, also, referred to as adenomatous or neoplastic
polyps, are true benign epithelial neoplasms and are much
rare in the stomach than in the large intestine. They are also
found more often in the region of pyloric antrum. They are
commonly associated with atrophic gastritis and pernicious
anaemia. Morphologically, adenomatous polyps of the
stomach resemble their counterparts in the large bowel and
are described on page 583.
Stromal Tumours
Stomach may be the site for occurrence of various uncommon
benign tumours of stromal cell origin e.g. leiomyomas (being
the most common); others are neurofibromas, schwannomas
and lipomas. They are usually firm, circumscribed nodules,
less than 4 cm in size and appear as submucosal nodules.
They resemble in gross and microscopic appearance with
their counterparts in other parts of the body.
 Currently, the term gastrointestinal stromal tumours
(GISTs) is used for a group of uncommon benign tumours
composed of spindle cells or stromal cells but lacking the

true phenotypic features of smooth muscle cells, neural cells
or Schwann cells. They are uncommon but as compared to
other sites in the GIT, are most common in the stomach. Their
behaviour is generally benign but may be recurrent,
aggressive or even metastasis may occur.
C. MALIGNANT TUMOURS
Gastric Carcinoma
INCIDENCE. Carcinoma of the stomach comprises more
than 90% of all gastric malignancies and is the leading cause
of cancer-related deaths in countries where its incidence is
high. The highest incidence is between 4th to 6th decades of
life and is twice more common in men than in women.
ETIOLOGY. A number of etiologic factors have been
implicated in causation of gastric cancer. These are as under:
1.
H. pylori infection. H. pylori infection of the stomach is
an important risk factor for the development of gastric cancer.
Epidemiologic studies throughout world have shown that a
seropositivity with H. pylori is associated with 3 to 6 times
higher risk of development of gastric cancer. It may be
mentioned here that similar association of H. pylori infection
exists with gastric lymphomas (MALT type) as well.
2.
Dietary factors. Epidemiological studies suggest that die-
tary factors are most significant in the etiology of gastric
cancer. The evidences in support of this are multifold:
i)
Occurrence of gastric cancer in the region of gastric canal
(i.e. along the lesser curvature and the pyloric antrum) where
irritating foods exert their maximum effect.
ii) Populations consuming certain foodstuffs have high risk
of developing gastric cancer e.g. ingestion of smoked foods,
high intake of salt, pickled raw vegetables, high intake of
carcinogens as nitrates in foods and drinking water, nitrites
as preservatives for certain meats etc. However, intake of
green leafy vegetables, citrus fruits and animal fats has been
reported to have protective role in gastric cancer.
iii) Tobacco smoke, tobacco juice and consumption of alcohol
have all been shown to have carcinogenic effect on gastric
mucosa.
3.
Geographical factors. There are geographic variations
in the incidence of gastric cancer. Japan, Chile and Italy have
the highest recorded death rate from gastric cancer, while
the incidence is considerably low in the US, UK and Canada.
The higher incidence in certain geographic regions is the
result of environmental influences as observed from the
finding of incidence of gastric cancer in the next generation
of Japanese immigrants to the US which is comparable to
that of native Americans.
4.
Racial factors. Within the country, different ethnic groups
may have variations in incidence of gastric cancer e.g.
incidence is higher in Blacks, American Indians, Chinese in
Indonesia, North Wales than other parts of Wales.
5.
Genetic factors. Genetic influences have some role in the
etiology of gastric cancer. Not more than 4% of patients of
gastric cancer have a family history of this disease.
Individuals with blood group A have higher tendency to
develop gastric cancer (Recall that the peptic ulcer is more
common in individuals with blood group O). A germ line
mutation in E-cadherin gene inherited as a autosomal
dominant pattern  has been linked to higher incidence of
occult gastric cancer in younger individuals.
6.
Pre-malignant changes in the gastric mucosa. There are
some conditions of gastric mucosa which have increased risk
to development of gastric cancer:
i)
Hypo- or achlorhydria in atrophic gastritis of gastric
mucosa with intestinal metaplasia.
ii) Adenomatous (neoplastic) polyps of the stomach.
iii) Chronic gastric ulcer (ulcer-cancer), and its association
with achlorhydria.
iv) Stump carcinoma in patients who have undergone partial
gastrectomy.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Gastric carcinoma is most
commonly located in the region of gastric canal (prepyloric
region) formed by lesser curvature, pylorus and antrum.
Other less common locations are the body, cardia and
fundus (Fig. 20.15).
Pathogenetically, a sequential evolution of all gastric
carcinomas from an initial stage of in situ carcinoma
confined to mucosal layers called early gastric carcinoma
(EGC) has been found. EGC eventually penetrates the
muscularis or beyond, resulting in advanced gastric
carcinoma. Accordingly, gastric carcinomas are broadly
classified into 2 main groups:
I.
Early gastric carcinoma (EGC).
II. Advanced gastric carcinoma, which has 5 further major
gross subtypes:
i)
Ulcerative carcinoma
ii) Fungating (Polypoid) carcinoma
iii) Scirrhous carcinoma (Linitis plastica)
iv) Colloid (Mucoid) carcinoma
v) Ulcer-cancer
In addition to the above classification, gastric
carcinomas have been classified, on the basis of extent of
invasion, into 2 groups:
Figure 20.15
Distribution of gastric carcinoma in the anatomical
subdivisions of the stomach. The serial numbers in the figure indicate
the order of frequency of occurrence of gastric cancer.

556
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
I.
 Expanding (formerly intestinal type) carcinomas that
grow laterally by an invasive margin. The tumour cells
are in the form of cohesive clusters.
II. Infiltrating (formerly diffuse type) carcinomas have
poorly-defined invasive border. The tumour cells are loose
and invade singly or in small group.
These classifications are summarised in Fig. 20.16 and
comparative morphology of various types is shown
diagrammatically in Fig. 20.18.
I.
EARLY GASTRIC CARCINOMA (EGC) (Fig.
20.18,A). EGC is the term used to describe cancer limited
to the mucosa and submucosa. The diagnosis of this
condition has been made possible by extensive work on
histogenesis of gastric cancer by Japanese pathologists by
the use of fibreoptic endoscope and gastrocamera. In
Japan, EGC comprises 35% of newly-diagnosed cases of
gastric cancer.
Grossly, the lesion of EGC may have 3 patterns—polypoid
(protruded), superficial and ulcerated (Fig. 20.17):
Type I
: Polypoid type
Type IIa
: Superficial elevated
Type II b
: Superficial flat
Type II c
: Superficial depressed
Type III
: Ulcerated type
Histologically, EGC is a typical glandular adeno-
carcinoma, usually well-differentiated type.
Prognosis of EGC after surgical resection is quite good;
5-year survival rate being 93-99%.
Early gastric carcinoma must be distinguished from
certain related terms as under:
Epithelial dysplasia is cellular atypia seen in intestinal
metaplasia such as in atrophic gastritis and pernicious
anaemia.
Carcinoma in situ in the stomach is a state of severe
cellular atypia or dysplasia, without invasion across the
basement membrane of the glands.
II. ADVANCED GASTRIC CARCINOMA. When the
carcinoma crosses the basement membrane into the
muscularis propria or beyond, it is referred to as advanced
gastric carcinoma. Advanced gastric carcinoma has
following 5 patterns:
i)
Ulcerative carcinoma (Fig. 20.18,B).  This is the most
common pattern. The tumour appears as a flat, infiltrating
and ulcerative growth with irregular necrotic base and
raised margin. It is seen more commonly in the region of
gastric canal (Fig. 20.19,A).
Histologically, ulcerative carcinomas are poorly-
differentiated adenocarcinomas, which invade deeply into
the stomach wall. Tubular and acinar patterns are seen
more commonly (Fig. 20.19, B).
ii) Fungating (polypoid) carcinoma (Fig. 20.18,C). The
second common pattern is a cauliflower growth projecting
into the lumen, similar to what is commonly seen in the
Figure 20.16
Classifications of gastric carcinomas. A, Conventional classification, showing correlation of the macroscopic subtypes with the
main histological patterns. B, Classification based on the depth of invasion by the tumour.

557
CHAPTER 20
The Gastrointestinal Tract
large intestine. It is seen more often in the fundus. The
tumour undergoes necrosis and infection commonly.
Histologically, fungating or polypoid carcinomas are
well-differentiated adenocarcinomas, commonly papillary
type.
iii) Scirrhous carcinoma (Linitis plastica) (Fig. 20.18,D).
In this pattern, the stomach wall is thickened due to
extensive desmoplasia giving the appearance as ‘leather-
bottle stomach’ or ‘linitis plastica’. The involvement may
be localised to pyloric antrum, or diffuse affecting whole
of the stomach from the cardia to pylorus. The lumen of
the stomach is reduced. There are no ulcers but rugae are
prominent (Fig. 20.19,C).
Histologically, it may be an adenocarcinoma or signet-
ring cell carcinoma, extensively infiltrating the stomach
wall, but due to marked desmoplasia cancer cells may be
difficult to find (Fig. 20.19,D).
iv) Colloid (Mucoid) carcinoma (Fig. 20.18,E). This
pattern is usually seen in the fundus. The tumour grows
like masses having gelatinous appearance due to secretion
of large quantities of mucus.
Histologically, mucoid carcinoma contains abundant
pools of mucin in which are seen a small number of
tumour cells, sometimes having signet-ring appearance.
v) Ulcer-cancer (Fig. 20.18,F). Development of cancer in
chronic gastric ulcer is a rare occurrence (less than 1%).
Majority of ulcer-cancers are malignant lesions from the
beginning. For confirmation of cancer in a pre-existing
gastric ulcer, the characteristic microscopic appearance of
peptic ulcer should be demonstrable with one portion of
the base or the margin of the ulcer showing carcinomatous
changes.
Histologically, ulcer-cancers are adenocarcinomas
without any specific features. The differences between a
benign and malignant gastric ulcer are summarised in
Table 20.5 (also see Fig. 20.13).
SPREAD. Carcinoma of the stomach may spread by the
following routes:
1.
Direct spread. Direct spread by local extension is the most
common feature of gastric carcinoma. The spread occurs
mainly from the loose submucosal layer but eventually
muscularis and serosa are also invaded. After the peritoneal
covering of the stomach has been invaded, transcoelomic
dissemination may occur in any other part of the peritoneal
cavity but ovarian masses (one sided or both-sided) occur
more commonly, referred to as Krukenberg tumours (Chapter
24). Submucosal spread occurs more often upwards into the
oesophagus due to continuity of the layers of stomach with
those of oesophagus, while the spread downwards into the
duodenum occurs less often due to the presence of pyloric
sphincter and submucosal Brunner’s glands. The tumour
may directly involve other neighbouring structures and
organs like lesser and greater omentum, pancreas, liver,
common bile duct, diaphragm, spleen and transverse colon.
2.
Lymphatic spread. Metastases to regional lymph nodes
occur early, especially in the scirrhous carcinoma. The groups
of lymph nodes involved are along the lesser and greater
curvature around the cardia and suprapancreatic lymph
nodes. Involvement of left supraclavicular lymph node,
Virchow or Troisier’s sign, is sometimes the presenting feature
of gastric carcinoma.
3.
Haematogenous spread. Blood spread of gastric
carcinoma may occur to the liver, lungs, brain, bones, kidneys
and adrenals. It occurs more commonly with the poorly-
differentiated carcinoma.
The American Joint Committee on Cancer has developed
TNM staging system for gastric carcinoma based on tumour
invasion (T), lymph node involvement (N) and distant
metastasis (M) into earliest stage Tis N0 M0 (intraepithelial
tumour) to most advanced stage Tany Nany M1.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Gastric carcinoma may have diverse
presentations. The usual clinical features are as under:
i)
Persistent abdominal pain

Systemic Pathology
ii) Gastric distension and vomiting
iii) Loss of weight (cachexia)
iv) Loss of appetite (anorexia)
v) Anaemia, weakness, malaise.
The most common complication of gastric cancer is
haemorrhage (in the form of haematemesis and/or melaena);
others are obstruction, perforation and jaundice.
Gastric carcinoma remains undiagnosed until late when
the symptoms appear. Therefore, the prognosis is generally
poor; 5-year survival rate being 5-15% from the time of
diagnosis of advanced gastric carcinoma. However, 5-year
survival rate for early gastric carcinoma is far higher
(93-99%) and hence the need for early diagnosis of the
condition.

CHAPTER 20
The Gastrointestinal Tract
Other Carcinomas
Besides the various morphologic patterns of adenocarcinoma
just described, other carcinomas that occur rarely in the
stomach are: adenosquamous carcinoma, squamous cell
carcinoma and undifferentiated carcinoma, all of which are
morphologically similar to such tumours elsewhere.
Leiomyosarcoma
Leiomyosarcoma, though rare, is the commonest soft tissue
sarcoma, the stomach being the more common site in the
gastrointestinal tract.
Grossly, the tumour may be of variable size but is usually
quite large, pedunculated and lobulated mass into the
lumen.
Microscopically, leiomyosarcoma is characterised by high
cellularity and presence of mitotic figures. Tumour is
usually well-differentiated.
Leiomyoblastoma (Epithelioid Leiomyoma)
This is a rare tumour, the behaviour of which is intermediate
between clearly benign and malignant tumour.
Grossly, the tumour is large, circumscribed and projects
into the lumen.
Microscopically, it is characterised by round to polygonal
cells with clear perinuclear halos. The number of mitoses
determines the biological behaviour of the tumour.
Carcinoid Tumour
Carcinoid tumours are rare in the stomach and are usually
non-argentaffin type but argentaffinomas also occur. Their
behaviour is usually malignant; they are described on

Lymphomas of Gut
Primary gastrointestinal lymphomas are defined as
lymphomas arising in the gut without any evidence of
systemic involvement at the time of presentation.
Secondary gastrointestinal lymphomas, on the other hand,
appear in the gut after dissemination from other primary
site.
Gastric lymphomas constitute over 50% of all bowel
lymphomas; other sites being small and large bowel in
decreasing order of frequency. Prognosis of primary gastric
lymphoma is better than for intestinal lymphomas. Primary
lymphoma of stomach is the most common malignant gastric
tumour (4%) next to carcinoma.
Clinical manifestations of gastric lymphomas may be
similar to gastric carcinoma. Age incidence for lymphomas
of the gastrointestinal tract is usually lower than that for
carcinoma (30-40 years as compared to 40-60 years in gastric
carcinoma) and may occur even in childhood. Relationship
with long-standing chronic H. pylori gastritis with lymphoid
hyperplasia has been strongly suggested.
Grossly, gastric lymphomas have 2 types of appearances:
1.
Diffusely infiltrating type, producing thickening of the
affected gut wall, obliteration of mucosal folds and

ulcerations. Cut section shows lesions in the mucosa and
submucosa but in late stage whole thickness of the gut
wall may be affected.
2.
Polypoid type, which produces large protruding mass
into the lumen with ulcerated surface.
Lymph node involvement may occur in either of the
two patterns.
Microscopically, gastric lymphomas are most often non-
Hodgkin’s lymphomas of the following types:
High-grade large cell immunoblastic lymphoma being
the most common.
Low-grade small lymphocytic well-differentiated B-cell
lymphoma referred to as MALToma is the next in
frequency (arising from Mucosa Associated Lymphoid
Tissue). The term pseudolymphoma is sometimes used for
non-invasive stage of MALToma.
SMALL INTESTINE
NORMAL STRUCTURE
Anatomically, the small bowel having a length of 550-650
cm, includes the duodenum, jejunum and ileum and tends
to become narrower throughout its course.
Histologically, the small bowel is identified by recognition
of villi. The wall of the small intestine consists of 4 layers:
1.
The serosa is the outer covering of the small bowel which
is complete except over a part of the duodenum.

growth with ulcerated surface and raised margins. B, Malignant cells forming irregular glands with stratification are seen invading the layers of the

561
CHAPTER 20
The Gastrointestinal Tract
2.
The muscularis propria is composed of 2 layers of smooth
muscle tissue—outer thinner longitudinal and inner thicker
circular layer. These muscles are functionally important for
peristalsis. Between the two layers of muscle lie ganglionated
plexus, myenteric plexus of Auerbach.
3.
The submucosa is composed of loose fibrous tissue with
blood vessels and lacteals in it. It contains a gangliated
plexus, Meissner’s plexus, having fewer and smaller cells
than the Auerbach’s plexus.
4.
The mucosa consists of glandular epithelium overlying
the lamina propria composed of loose connective tissue and
contains phagocytic cells and abundance of lymphoid cells
(Peyer’s patches in the ileum) and plasma cells. It is
supported externally by thin layer of smooth muscle fibres,
muscularis mucosae. The mucous membrane is thrown into
folds or plicae which are more in the jejunum and less in the
ileum, thus increasing the absorptive surface enormously.
The absorptive surface is further increased by the intestinal
villi. Villi are finger-like or leaf-like projections which contain
3 types of cells:
i)
Simple columnar cells. They perform absorptive function
due to the presence of brush border consisting of large
number of microvilli.
ii) Goblet cells.  These are mucus-secreting cells and are
interspersed between the columnar cells.
iii) Endocrine cells. These are scattered in the villi as well as
are widely distributed throughout the gastrointestinal tract.
These cells have various synonyms as under:
Kulchitsky cells, after the name of its discoverer.
Enterochromaffin cells, due to their resemblance to
chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla.
Argentaffin cells, as the intracytoplasmic granules stain
positively with silver salts by reduction reaction (argyrophil
cells, on the other hand, require the addition of exogenous
reducing substance for staining).
Endocrine cells, as these specialised cells are considered
to be part of APUD cell system (having common properties
as Amine content, amine Precursor Uptake and Decarboxy-
lation). APUD cells are considered to be endodermal in origin,
while previously they were thought to be neural crest
derivative. Other endocrine cells belonging to the APUD cell
system are C-cells of the thyroid, chromaffin cells of the
adrenal medulla, certain cells of the carotid body, bronchi,
hypothalamus, pituitary and sympathetic ganglia.
Endocrine cells are heavily populated in the proximal
small bowel as this is the most active site for absorption and
secretory activities. They are sparse in the colon which is
less active site for such functions.
The duodenum contains distinctively branched Brunner’s
glands present in the submucosa and going up to muscularis
mucosae. The deeper layer of the mucosa of the small
intestine elsewhere contains intestinal glands or crypts of
Lieberkuhn. They are lined by columnar cells, goblet cells,
endocrine cells and Paneth cells. Paneth cells are normally
exclusively found in the small intestine and occasionally in
the caecum. These cells are characterised by the presence of
supranuclear granules rich in lysozyme.
The blood supply of the whole of small intestine, except
the first part of the duodenum, is by the superior mesenteric
artery which supplies blood by mesenteric arterial arcades
and the straight arteries.
The main functions of the small intestine are digestion
and absorption so that ultimately nutrients passing into the
bloodstream are utilised by the cells in metabolism. The
mucosal layer of the small intestine has remarkable capacity
for regeneration and new lining is laid every 3-4 days.
CONGENITAL ANOMALIES
Intestinal Atresia and Stenosis
Intestinal atresia is congenital absence of lumen, most
commonly affecting the ileum or duodenum. The proximal
segment has a blind end which is separated from distal
segment freely, or the two segments are joined by a fibrous
cord. The condition must be recognised early and treated
surgically, as otherwise it is incompatible with life.
Intestinal stenosis is congenital narrowing of the lumen
affecting a segment of the small intestine. Intestinal segment
above the level of obstruction is dilated and that below it is
collapsed.
Meckel’s Diverticulum
Meckel’s diverticulum is the most common congenital
anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, occurring in 2% of
population. It is more common in males. The anomaly is
commonly situated on the antimesenteric border of the ileum,
about 1 meter above the ileocaecal valve. Like other true
diverticula, Meckel’s diverticulum is an outpouching
containing all the layers of the intestinal wall in their normal
orientation (Fig. 20.20). It is almost always lined by small
intestinal type of epithelium; rarely it may contain islands of
gastric mucosa and ectopic pancreatic tissue. Embryologic
origin of Meckel’s diverticulum is from incomplete
obliteration of vitellointestinal duct. (Other anomalies
resulting from the remnants of vitellointestinal duct are
vitelline sinus and vitelline cyst).
The common complications of Meckel’s diverticulum are
perforation, haemorrhage and diverticulitis.
In addition to congenital Meckel’s diverticulum, acquired
diverticula also occur in the small intestine. These are
commonly multiple (diverticulosis), frequently located on the
mesenteric border, and are sometimes associated with
malabsorption.
Intestinal Malrotation
Malrotation is a developmental abnormality of the midgut
(i.e. the portion of intestine between the duodenojejunal
flexure and the middle of transverse colon). Due to failure of
normal rotation of midgut, the following consequences can
occur:
i)
Exomphalos i.e. intestinal eventration at the umbilicus.
ii) Misplacement of the caecum, appendix and ascending
colon.
iii) Mobile caecum.

562
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION
Conditions which interfere with the propulsion of contents
in the intestine are considered under the heading of intestinal
obstruction. The causes of intestinal obstruction can be
classified under the following 3 broad groups:
1.
Mechanical obstruction. It can occur as a result of the
following causes:
i)
Internal obstruction (intramural and intraluminal):
Inflammatory strictures (e.g. Crohn’s disease)
Congenital stenosis, atresia, imperforate anus
Tumours
Meconium in mucoviscidosis
Roundworms
Gallstones, faecoliths, foreign bodies
Ulceration induced by potassium chloride tablets
prescribed to counter hypokalaemia.
ii) External compression:
Peritoneal adhesions and bands
Strangulated hernias
Intussusception
Volvulus
Intra-abdominal tumour.
2.
Neurogenic obstruction. It occurs due to paralytic ileus
i.e. paralysis of muscularis of the intestine as a result of shock
after abdominal operation or by acute peritonitis.
3.
Vascular obstruction. Obstruction of the superior mesen-
teric artery or its branches may result in infarction causing
paralysis. The causes are as under:
Thrombosis
Embolism
Accidental ligation.
Out of the various causes listed above, conditions
producing external compression on the bowel wall are the
most common causes of intestinal obstruction (80%). Some
of these are described below.
Peritoneal Adhesions and Bands
Adhesions and bands in the peritoneum composed of fibrous
tissue result following healing in peritonitis. Rarely, such
fibrous adhesions and bands may be without any preceding
peritoneal inflammation and are of congenital origin. In either
case, peritoneal bands and adhesions result in partial or
complete intestinal obstruction by outside pressure on the
bowel wall.
Hernias
Hernia is protrusion of portion of a viscus through an
abnormal opening in the wall of its natural cavity.
External hernia is the protrusion of the bowel through a
defect or weakness in the peritoneum.
Internal hernia is the term applied for herniation that
does not present on the external surface.
Two major factors involved in the formation of a hernia
are as under:
i)
Local weakness which may be congenital e.g. at the
umbilicus, inguinal and femoral canals, and in surgical scars
called ‘incisional hernia’.
ii) Increased intra-abdominal pressure that is produced by
coughing, straining and exertion.
Inguinal hernias are more common, followed in
decreasing frequency, by femoral and umbilical hernias.
Inguinal hernias may be of 2 types:
Direct when hernia passes medial to the inferior
epigastric artery and it appears through the external
abdominal ring.
Indirect when it follows the inguinal canal lateral to the
inferior epigastric artery.
When the contents of hernia such as loop of intestine can
be returned to the abdominal cavity, it is called reducible.
When it is not possible to reduce hernia due to large contents
or due to adhesions in the hernial sac, it is referred to as
irreducible.

outpouching which on section is seen communicating with the intestinal lumen. The lumen contains necrotic debris.

563
CHAPTER 20
The Gastrointestinal Tract
When the blood flow in the hernial sac is obstructed, it
results in strangulated hernia. Obstruction to the venous
drainage and arterial supply may result in infarction or
gangrene of the affected loop of intestine. The gross and
microscopic appearance of strangulated intestine is the same
as that of infarction of intestine.
Intussusception
Intussusception is the telescoping of a segment of intestine
into the segment below due to peristalsis. The telescoped
segment is called the intussusceptum and lower receiving
segment is called the intussuscipiens. The condition occurs
more commonly in infants and young children, more often
in the ileocaecal region when the portion of ileum invaginates
into the ascending colon without affecting the position of
the ileocaecal valve (Fig. 20.21). Less common forms are ileo-
ileal and colo-colic intussusception.
In children, the cause is usually not known though
enlargement of the lymphoid tissue in the terminal ileum
has been suggested by some. In the case of adults, the usual
causes are foreign bodies and tumours.
The main complications of intussusception are intestinal
obstruction, infarction, gangrene, perforation and peritonitis.
Volvulus
Volvulus is the twisting of loop of intestine upon itself
through 180° or more. This leads to obstruction of the
intestine as well as cutting off of the blood supply to the
affected loop. The usual causes are bands and adhesions
(congenital or acquired) and long mesenteric attachment. The
condition is more common in the sigmoid colon than the
small bowel.
ISCHAEMIC BOWEL DISEASE
(ISCHAEMIC ENTEROCOLITIS)
Ischaemic lesions of the gastrointestinal tract may occur in
the small intestine and/or colon; the latter is called ischaemic
colitis or ischaemic enterocolitis and is commonly referred to
as ischaemic bowel disease. In either case, the cause of
ischaemia is compromised mesenteric circulation, while
ischaemic effect is less likely to occur in the stomach,
duodenum and rectum due to abundant collateral blood
supply.
Depending upon the extent and severity of ischaemia, 3
patterns of pathologic lesions can occur (Fig. 20.22):
1.
Transmural infarction, characterised by full thickness
involvement i.e. transmural ischaemic necrosis and gangrene
of the bowel.
2
Mural infarction, characterised by haemorrhagic gastro-
enteropathy (haemorrhage and necrosis). The ischaemic
effect in mural infarction is limited to mucosa, submucosa
and superficial muscularis, while mucosal infarction is
confined to mucosal layers superficial to muscularis
mucosae.
3.
Ischaemic colitis, due to chronic colonic ischaemia causing
fibrotic narrowing of the affected bowel.
These pathologic patterns are described below:
Transmural Infarction
Ischaemic necrosis of the full-thickness of the bowel wall is
more common in the small intestine than the large intestine.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The common causes of transmural
infarction of small bowel are as under:
i)
Mesenteric arterial thrombosis such as due to the following:
Atherosclerosis (most common)
Aortic aneurysm
Vasospasm
Fibromuscular hyperplasia
Invasion by the tumour
Use of oral contraceptives
Arteritis of various types
ii) Mesenteric arterial embolism arising from the following
causes:
Mural thrombi in the heart
Endocarditis (infective and nonbacterial thrombotic)
Atherosclerotic plaques
Atrial myxoma
iii) Mesenteric venous occlusion is less common cause of full-
thickness infarction of the bowel. The causes are as under:

564
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Intestinal sepsis e.g. appendicitis
Portal venous thrombosis in cirrhosis of the liver
Tumour invasion
Use of oral contraceptives
iv) Miscellaneous causes:
Strangulated hernia
Torsion
Fibrous bands and adhesions.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, irrespective of
the underlying etiology, infarction of the bowel is
haemorrhagic (red) type (page 126). A varying length of
the small bowel may be affected. In the case of colonic
infarction, the distribution area of superior and inferior
mesenteric arteries (i.e. splenic flexure) is more commonly
involved. The affected areas become dark purple and
markedly congested and the peritoneal surface is coated
with fibrinous exudate. The wall is thickened, oedematous
and haemorrhagic. The lumen is dilated and contains
blood and mucus. In arterial occlusion, there is sharp line
of demarcation between the infarcted bowel and the
normal intestine, whereas in venous occlusion the
infarcted area merges imperceptibly into the normal bowel
(Fig. 20.23).
Microscopically, there is coagulative necrosis and ulcera-
tion of the mucosa and there are extensive submucosal
haemorrhages. The muscularis is less severely affected by
ischaemia. Subsequently, inflammatory cell infiltration
and secondary infection occur, leading to gangrene of the
bowel (Fig. 20.24).
The condition is clinically characterised by ‘abdominal
angina’ in which the patient has acute abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, and sometimes diarrhoea. The disease is
rapidly fatal, with 50-70% mortality rate.
Mural and Mucosal Infarction (Haemorrhagic
Gastroenteropathy, Membranous Colitis)
Mural and mucosal infarctions are limited to superficial
layers of the bowel wall, sparing the deeper layer of the
muscularis and the serosa. The condition is also referred to
as haemorrhagic gastroenteropathy, and in the case of colon as
membranous colitis.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Haemorrhagic gastroenteropathy
results from conditions causing non-occlusive hypoperfusion
(compared from transmural infarction which occurs from
occlusive causes). These are as under:
Shock
Cardiac failure
Infections
Intake of drugs causing vasoconstriction e.g. digitalis,
norepinephrine.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the lesions affect
variable length of the bowel. The affected segment of the
bowel is red or purple but without haemorrhage and
exudation on the serosal surface. The mucosa is
oedematous at places, sloughed and ulcerated at other
places. The lumen contains haemorrhagic fluid.
Microscopically, there is patchy ischaemic necrosis of
mucosa, vascular congestion, haemorrhages and
inflammatory cell infiltrate. The changes may extend into
superficial muscularis but deeper layer of muscularis and
serosa are spared. Secondary bacterial infection may
supervene resulting in pseudomembranous enterocolitis.
Clinically, as in transmural infarction, the features of
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are present,
but the changes are reversible and curable. With adequate

The Gastrointestinal Tract
therapy, normal morphology is completely restored in
superficial lesions, while deeper lesions may heal by fibrosis
leading to stricture formation.
Ischaemic Colitis
Although this condition affects primarily colon in the region
of splenic flexure, it is described here due to its apparent
pathogenetic relationship with ischaemic injury. Ischaemic
colitis is characterised by chronic segmental colonic
ischaemia followed by chronic inflammation and healing by
fibrosis and scarring causing obstruction (ischaemic
stricture).
Grossly, most frequently affected site is the splenic flexure;
other site is rectum. Ischaemic colitis passes through 3
stages: infarct, transient ischaemia and ischaemic stricture.
However, the surgical submitted specimens generally are
of the ischaemic stricture. External surface of the affected
area is fusiform or saccular. On cut section, there are
patchy, segmental and longitudinal mucosal ulcers. Thus,
the gross appearance can be confused with either of the
two types of inflammatory bowel disease.
Microscopically, the ulcerated areas of the mucosa show
granulation tissue. The submucosa is characteristically
thickened due to inflammation and fibrosis. The
muscularis may also show inflammatory changes and
patchy replacement by fibrosis. The blood vessels may
show atheromatous emboli, organising thrombi and
endarteritis obliterans.
NECROTISING ENTEROCOLITIS
Necrotising enterocolitis is an acute inflammation of the
terminal ileum and ascending colon, occurring primarily in
premature and low-birth-weight infants within the first week
of life and less commonly in full-term infants.
ETIOLOGY. The condition has been considered as a variant
of the spectrum of ischaemic bowel disease. Important factors
in the etiology of this disorder, thus, are as follows:
1.
Ischaemia
2.
Hypoxia/anoxia of the bowel due to bypassing of blood
from the affected area
3.
Bacterial infection and endotoxins
4.
Establishment of feeding
5.
Infants fed on commercial formulae than breast-fed,
implying the role of immunoprotective factors.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the affected
segment of the bowel is dilated, necrotic, haemorrhagic
and friable. Bowel wall may contain bubbles of air
(pneumatosis intestinalis).
Microscopically, the changes are variable depending upon
the stage. Initial changes are confined to mucosa and show
oedema, haemorrhage and coagulative necrosis. A
pseudomembrane composed of necrotic epithelium, fibrin
and inflammatory cells may develop. As the ischaemic
process extends to the subjacent layers, muscle layer is
also involved and may lead to perforation and peritonitis.
In healed cases, stricture formation, malabsorption and
short bowel syndrome are the usual complications.
INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
(CROHN’S DISEASE AND ULCERATIVE COLITIS)
DEFINITION. The term ‘inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)’
is commonly used to include 2 idiopathic bowel diseases
having many similarities but the conditions usually have
distinctive morphological appearance. These 2 conditions are
Crohn’s disease (regional enteritis) and ulcerative colitis:
1.
Crohn’s disease or Regional enteritis is an idiopathic
chronic ulcerative IBD, characterised by transmural, non-
caseating granulomatous inflammation, affecting most
commonly the segment of terminal ileum and/or colon,
though any part of the gastrointestinal tract may be involved.
2.
Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic form of acute and
chronic ulcero-inflammatory colitis affecting chiefly the
mucosa and submucosa of the rectum and descending colon,
though sometimes it may involve the entire length of the
large bowel.
Both these disorders primarily affect the bowel but may
have systemic involvement in the form of polyarthritis,
uveitis, ankylosing spondylitis, skin lesions and hepatic
involvement. Both diseases can occur at any age but are more
frequent in 2nd and 3rd decades of life. Females are affected
slightly more often.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The exact etiology of IBD remains
unknown. However, multiple factors are implicated which
can be considered under the following 3 groups:
1.
Genetic factors. Genetic factors are implicated in the
etiopathogenesis of IBD is supported by the following
evidences:
i) There is about 3 to 20 times higher incidence of occurrence
of IBD in first-degree relatives. This is due to genetic defect
causing diminished epithelial barrier function.
ii) Overall, there is approximately 50% chance of develop-
ment of IBD (Crohn’s disease about 60% concordance,
ulcerative colitis about 6% concordance) in monozygotic
twins.
iii) Although no specific and consistent gene association with
IBD has been seen, genome wide search has revealed that
disease-predisposing loci are present in chromosomes 16q,
12p, 6p, 14q and 5q. In particular, CARD15 (caspase-
associated recruitment domain containing protein 15) on
chromosome 16q is expressed by several cells in the intestinal
mocosa which in mutated form results in loss of its function
and renders an individual about 50-times higher risk to
develop Crohn’s disease.
iv) HLA studies show that ulcerative colitis is more common
in HLA-DRB1-alleles while Crohn’s disease is more common
in HLA-DR7 and DQ4 alleles.
2. Immunologic factors. Defective immunologic regulation
in IBD has been shown to play significant role in the
pathogenesis of IBD:
i) Defective regulation of immune suppression. In a normal
individual, there is lack of immune responsiveness to dietary

566
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
antigens and commensal flora in the intestinal lumen. The
mechanism responsible for this is by activation of CD4+ T
cells secreting cytokines inhibitory to inflammation (IL-10,
TGF-β) which suppress inflammation in the gut wall. In IBD,
this immune mechanism of suppression of inflammation is
defective and thus results in uncontrolled inflammation.
ii) Transgenic mouse experimental model studies. Gene ‘knock
out’ studies on colitis in mice have revealed that multiple
immune abnormalities may be responsible for IBD as under:
a) Deletion of inflammation inhibitory cytokines (e.g. IL-2,
IL-10, TGF-β) or their receptors.
b) Deletion of molecules responsible for T cell recognition
(e.g. T cell antigen receptors, MHC class II).
c) Interference with normal epithelial barrier function in the
intestine (e.g. blocking N-cadherin, deletion of multi-drug
resistance MDR gene).
iii) Type of inflammatory cells. In both types of IBD, activated
CD4+ T cells are present in the lamina propria and in the
peripheral blood. These cells either activate other
inflammatory cells (e.g. macrophages and B cells), or recruit
more inflammatory cells by stimulation of homing receptor
on leucocytes and vascular endothelium. There are two main
types of CD4+ T cells in IBD:
 TH1 cells secrete proinflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and
TNF which induce transmural granulomatous inflammation
seen in Crohn’s disease. IL-12 initiates TH1 cytokine
pathway.
 TH2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 which induce
superficial mucosal inflammation characteristically seen in
ulcerative colitis.
3. Exogenous factors. In addition to role of genetic factors
and deranged T-cell mediated immunity, a role for several
exogenous and environmental factors has been assigned:
i) Microbial factors: At different times, role of a variety of
microbes in initiation of inflammatory response by the body
has been suspected. Accordingly, several microorganism
species (bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi) have been

suspect but without definite evidence: Mycobacterium
paratuberculosis, Salmonella, Shigella, Helicobacter, Clostridia,
bacteroides, Escherichia, Measles virus etc.
ii) Psychosocial factors: It has been observed that individuals
who are unduly sensitive, dependent on others and unable
to express themselves, or some major life events such as
illness or death in the family, divorce, interpersonal conflicts
etc, suffer from irritable colon or have exacerbation of
symptoms. Patients of IBD in the West have been found to
suffer from greater functional impairment than the general
population, as assessed by sickness impact profile which is a
measure of overall psychological and physical functioning.
iii) Smoking: Role of smoking in causation of Crohn’s disease
has been reported.
iv) Oral contraceptives: An increased risk to develop Crohn’s
disease with long-term use of oral contraceptives has been
found in some studies but there is no such increased risk for
ulcerative colitis.
Consensus hypothesis in pathogenesis of IBD combines
the role of above three major groups of etiologic factors: i.e.
in a genetically predisposed individual, the effects of exogenous
and endogenous host factors result in dysregulation of
mucosal immune function, which gets further modified by
certain environmental factors.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The morphologic features
of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are sufficiently
distinctive so as to be classified separately. These features
are presented below; the distinguishing features of the
two conditions are summarised in Table 20.6.
CROHN’S DISEASE. Crohn’s disease may involve any
portion of the gastrointestinal tract but affects most
commonly 15-25 cm of the terminal ileum which may extend
into the caecum and sometimes into the ascending colon:
Grossly, characteristic feature is the multiple, well-
demarcated segmental bowel involvement with
intervening uninvolved ‘skip areas’. The wall of the
affected bowel segment is thick and hard, resembling a
‘hose pipe’. Serosa may be studded with minute granu-
lomas. The lumen of the affected segment is markedly
narrowed. The mucosa shows ‘serpiginous ulcers’, while
intervening surviving mucosa is swollen giving
‘cobblestone appearance’. There may be deep fissuring
into the bowel wall (Fig. 20.25).
Histologically, the characteristic features are as follows
(Fig. 20.26):
1.
Transmural inflammatory cell infiltrate consisting of
chronic inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells and
macrophages) is the classical microscopic feature.
2.
Non-caseating, sarcoid-like granulomas are present in all
the layers of the affected bowel wall in 60% of cases and
may even be seen in the regional lymph nodes.
3.
There is patchy ulceration of the mucosa which may take
the form of deep fissures, accompanied by inflammatory
infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells.
4.
There is widening of the submucosa due to oedema and
foci of lymphoid aggregates.
5.
In more chronic cases, fibrosis becomes increasingly
prominent in all the layers disrupting muscular layer.
ULCERATIVE COLITIS. Classically, ulcerative colitis
begins in the rectum, and in continuity extends upwards into
the sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, and
sometimes may involve the entire colon. The colonic contents

are characteristically segmental with intervening uninvolved ‘skip areas’.
The bowel wall is thickened and the lumen narrowed, giving hose-pipe
appearance. Serpiginous ulcers, some deep fissures and swollen
intervening surviving mucosa giving ‘cobblestone appearance’, are present.
B, The specimen of small intestine is shown in longitudinal section along
with a segment in cross section. External surface shows increased
mesenteric fat, thickened wall and narrow lumen. Luminal surface of
longitudinal cut section shows segment of thickened wall with narrow lumen
which is better appreciated in cross section (arrow) while intervening areas
of the bowel are uninvolved or skipped.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
may rarely backflow into the terminal ileum in continuity,
causing ‘back-wash ileitis’ in about 10% of cases.
Grossly, the characteristic feature is the continuous
involvement of the rectum and colon without any uninvol-
ved skip areas compared to Crohn’s disease. The
appearance of colon may vary depending upon the stage
and intensity of the disease because of remissions and
exacerbations. Mucosa shows linear and superficial ulcers,
usually not penetrating the muscular layer. The
intervening intact mucosa may form inflammatory
‘pseudopolyps.’ The muscle layer is thickened due to
contraction, producing shortening and narrowing of the
affected colon with loss of normal haustral folds giving
‘garden-hose appearance’ (Fig. 20.27).
Histologically, ulcerative colitis because of remission and
exacerbations, is characterised by alternating ‘active
disease process’ and ‘resolving colitis.’ The changes in the
‘active disease process’ are as under (Fig. 20.28):
1.
Crypt distortion, cryptitis and focal accumulations of
neutrophils forming crypt abscesses.
2.
Marked congestion, dilatation and haemorrhages from
mucosal capillaries.
3.
Superficial mucosal ulcerations, usually not penetrating
into the muscle coat, except in severe cases, and is
accompanied by nonspecific inflammatory cell infiltrate
Figure 20.26
Crohn’s disease of the ileum. The histological features present are: transmural chronic inflammatory cell infiltration, deep fissures
into the bowel wall, submucosal widening due to oedema, some prominent lymphoid follicles and a few non-caseating epithelioid cell granulomas
in the bowel wall.

carcinoma.
COMPLICATIONS. Complications of Crohn’s disease and
ulcerative colitis are as under:
Crohn’s disease:
1.
Malabsorption due to impaired absorption of fat, vitamin
B12, proteins and electrolytes from the diseased small bowel.
2.
Fistula formation may occur in long-standing cases. These
may be internal fistulae between the loops of the intestine,
or external fistulae such as enterocutaneous, rectal and anal
fistulae.
3.
Stricture formation may occur in chronic cases due to
extensive fibrosis in the affected bowel wall.
4.
Development of malignancy in the small intestine as a late
complication of Crohn’s disease is rarer than that in ulcerative
colitis, but lymphoma may develop more often in Crohn’s
disease than adenocarcinoma (seen in some long-standing
cases of ulcerative colitis).
Ulcerative colitis:
1.
Toxic megacolon (Fulminant colitis) is the acute fulminating
colitis in which the affected colon is thin-walled and dilated
and is prone to perforation and faecal peritonitis. There is
deep penetration of the inflammatory cell infiltrate into
muscle layer which is disrupted.
2.
Perianal fistula formation may occur rarely.
3.
Carcinoma may develop in long-standing cases of
ulcerative colitis of more than 10 years duration.
4.
Stricture formation almost never occurs in ulcerative colitis.
OTHER INFLAMMATORY LESIONS OF THE BOWEL
Besides IBD, a variety of other acute and chronic inflam-
matory conditions affect small bowel (enteritis), large bowel
(colitis), or both (enterocolitis); the last named being more
common. Hence, all these conditions involving small bowel
and/or large bowel are described together here for better
correlation of features.
The various forms of inflammations of the bowel after
excluding IBD can be categorised broadly into ‘infective
enterocolitis’ and ‘pseudomembranous enterocolitis.’
INFECTIVE ENTEROCOLITIS
These are a group of acute and chronic inflammatory lesions
of small intestine and/or colon caused by microorganisms
(bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa and helminths). All these
are characterised by diarrhoeal syndromes. Pathogenetically
speaking, these microorganisms can cause enterocolitis by 2
mechanisms—by enteroinvasive bacteria producing ulcerative
lesions, and by enterotoxin-producing bacteria resulting in non-
ulcerative lesions.
A list of common microorganisms producing enterocolitis
is presented in Table 20.7. A few important forms are
described below.
Intestinal Tuberculosis
Intestinal tuberculosis can occur in 3 forms—primary,
secondary and hyperplastic caecal tuberculosis.
1.
PRIMARY INTESTINAL TUBERCULOSIS. Though an
uncommon disease in the developed countries of the world,
Figure 20.28
Ulcerative colitis in active phase. The microscopic features seen are superficial ulcerations, with mucosal infiltration by inflammatory
cells and a ‘crypt abscess’.

570
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
primary tuberculosis of the ileocaecal region is quite common
in developing countries including India. In the pre-
pasteurisation era, it used to occur by ingestion of unpas-
teurised cow’s milk infected with Mycobacterium bovis. But
now-a-days due to control of tuberculosis in cattle and
pasteurisation of milk, virtually all cases of intestinal
tuberculosis are caused by M. tuberculosis. The predominant
changes are in the mesenteric lymph nodes without any
significant intestinal lesion.
Grossly, the affected lymph nodes are enlarged, matted
and caseous (tabes mesenterica). Eventually, there is
healing by fibrosis and calcification (Fig. 20.29,A).
Microscopically, in the initial stage, there is primary
complex or Ghon’s focus in the intestinal mucosa as occurs
elsewhere in primary tuberculous infection (page 153).
Subsequently, the mesenteric lymph nodes are affected
which show typical tuberculous granulomatous
inflammatory reaction with caseation necrosis.
Tuberculous peritonitis may occur due to spread of the
infection.
2.
SECONDARY INTESTINAL TUBERCULOSIS. Self-
swallowing of sputum in patients with active pulmonary
tuberculosis may cause secondary intestinal tuberculosis,
most commonly in the terminal ileum and rarely in the colon.
Grossly, the intestinal lesions are prominent than the
lesions in regional lymph nodes as in secondary
pulmonary tuberculosis (Fig. 20.29,B). The lesions begin
in the Peyer’s patches or the lymphoid follicles with
formation of small ulcers that spread through the
lymphatics to form large ulcers which are transverse to the
long axis of the bowel, (c.f. typhoid ulcers of small intestine,
described below). These ulcers may be coated with caseous
material. Serosa may be studded with visible tubercles.
In advanced cases, transverse fibrous strictures and
intestinal obstruction are seen (Fig. 20.30,A, B).
Histologically, the tuberculous lesions in the intestine are
similar to those observed elsewhere i.e. presence of
tubercles. Mucosa and submucosa show ulceration and
the muscularis may be replaced by variable degree of
fibrosis (Fig. 20.30,C). Tuberculous peritonitis may be
observed.
3.
HYPERPLASTIC CAECAL TUBERCULOSIS. This is a
variant of occurring secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis.
Grossly, the caecum and/or ascending colon are thick-
walled with mucosal ulceration. Clinically, the lesion is
palpable and may be mistaken for carcinoma
(Fig. 20.29,C).

CHAPTER 20
The Gastrointestinal Tract
Microscopically, the presence of caseating tubercles
distinguishes the condition from Crohn’s disease in which
granulomas are non-caseating. Besides, bacteriological
evidence by culture or animal inoculation and Mantoux
test are helpful in differential diagnosis of the two
conditions.
Enteric Fever
The term enteric fever is used to describe acute infection
caused by Salmonella typhi (typhoid fever) or Salmonella
paratyphi (paratyphoid fever). Besides these 2 salmonellae,
Salmonella typhimurium causes food poisoning.
PATHOGENESIS. The typhoid bacilli are ingested through
contaminated food or water. During the initial asymptomatic
incubation period of about 2 weeks, the bacilli invade the
lymphoid follicles and Peyer’s patches of the small intestine
and proliferate. Following this, the bacilli invade the blood-
stream causing bacteraemia, and the characteristic clinical
features of the disease like continuous rise in temperature
and ‘rose spots’ on the skin are observed. Immunological
reactions (Widal’s test) begin after about 10 days and peak
titres are seen by the end of the third week. Eventually, the
bacilli are localised in the intestinal lymphoid tissue
(producing typhoid intestinal lesions), in the mesenteric
lymph nodes (leading to haemorrhagic lymphadenitis), in
the liver (causing foci of parenchymal necrosis), in the gall
bladder (producing typhoid cholecystitis), and in the spleen
(resulting in splenic reactive hyperplasia).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The lesions are observed
in the intestines as well as in other organs.
1.
INTESTINAL LESIONS. Grossly, terminal ileum is
affected most often, but lesions may be seen in the jejunum
and colon. Peyer’s patches show oval typhoid ulcers with
their long axis along the length of the bowel, (c.f. tuberculous
ulcers of small intestine, described above). The base of
the ulcers is black due to sloughed mucosa. The margins
of the ulcers are slightly raised due to inflammatory
oedema and cellular proliferation. There is never signifi-
cant fibrosis and hence fibrous stenosis seldom occurs in
healed typhoid lesions. The regional lymph nodes are
invariably enlarged (Fig. 20.31,A).
Microscopically, there is hyperaemia, oedema and cellular
proliferation consisting of phagocytic histiocytes (showing
characteristic erythrophagocytosis), lymphocytes and
plasma cells. Though enteric fever is an example of acute
inflammation, neutrophils are invariably absent from the
cellular infiltrate and this is reflected in the leucopenia
with neutropenia and relative lymphocytosis in the
peripheral blood (Fig. 20.31,B).
The main complications of the intestinal lesions of
typhoid are perforation of the ulcers and haemorrhage.
2.
OTHER LESIONS. Besides the intestinal involvement,
various other organs and tissues showing pathological
changes in enteric fever are as under:
i) Mesenteric lymph nodes—haemorrhagic lymph-
adenitis.
ii) Liver—foci of parenchymal necrosis.
iii) Gallbladder—typhoid cholecystitis.
iv) Spleen—splenomegaly with reactive hyperplasia.
v) Kidneys—nephritis.
vi) Abdominal muscles—Zenker’s degeneration.
vii) Joints—arthritis.
viii) Bones—osteitis.
ix) Meninges—Meningitis.
x) Testis—Orchitis.

572
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Persistence of organism in the gallbladder or urinary tract
may result in passage of organisms in the faeces or urine
creating a ‘carrier state’ which is a source of infection to
others.
Bacterial Food Poisoning
This is a form of acute bacterial illness that occurs following
ingestion of food or water contaminated with bacteria other
than those that cause specific acute intestinal infections like
typhoid, paratyphoid, cholera or dysentery bacilli. The illness
results from either bacterial invasion or bacterial toxigenic
effect on the bowel.
The commonest causes of bacterial food poisoning
resulting in enteritis or enterocolitis are as under:
1.
Staphylococcal food poisoning. Staphylococcus aureus
infection acquired from contaminated food produces either
mild food poisoning by enterotoxins, or may cause more severe
form of the illness called pseudomembranous enterocolitis
described below. Staphylococcal food poisoning occurs due
to liberation of enterotoxins by the bacteria.
2.
Clostridial food poisoning. Infection with anaerobic
organisms Clostridium welchii, following consumption of
contaminated meat results in acute food poisoning (page 181).
The illness occurs both by bacterial invasion as well as by
toxins.
3.
Botulism. This is a severe form of paralysing illness
caused by ingestion of organism, Clostridium botulinum,
which produces neurotoxin.
4.
Salmonella food poisoning (Salmonellosis). This is an
infection (and not caused by toxins) occurring due to food
contaminated by S. typhimurium or S. enteritidis. The condition
manifests with fever, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Death may
result from depletion of water and electrolytes.
Dysenteries
The term ‘dysentery’ is used to mean diarrhoea with
abdominal cramps, tenesmus and passage of mucus in the
stools, from any cause. There are 2 main forms of dysen-
teries—bacillary and amoebic.
1.
BACILLARY DYSENTERY. Bacillary dysentery is the
term used for infection by shigella species: S. dysenteriae, S.
flexneri, S. boydii and S. sonnei. Infection occurs by foeco-oral
route and is seen with poor personal hygiene, in densely
populated areas, and with contaminated food and water. The
common housefly plays a role in spread of infection.
Grossly, the lesions are mainly found in the colon and
occasionally in the ileum. Superficial transverse
ulcerations of mucosa of the bowel wall occur in the region
of lymphoid follicles but perforation is seldom seen. The
intervening intact mucosa is hyperaemic and oedematous.
Following recovery from the acute attack, complete
healing usually takes place.
Microscopically, the mucosa overlying the lymphoid
follicles is necrosed. The surrounding mucosa shows
congestion, oedema and infiltration by neutrophils and
lymphocytes. The mucosa may be covered by greyish-
yellow ‘pseudomembrane’ composed of fibrinosuppurative
exudate.
The complications of bacillary dysentery are haemorrhage,
perforation, stenosis, polyarthritis and iridocyclitis.
2.
AMOEBIC DYSENTERY. This is due to infection by
Entamoeba histolytica. It is more prevalent in the tropical
countries and primarily affects the large intestine. Infection
occurs from ingestion of cyst form of the parasite. The cyst
wall is dissolved in the small intestine from where the
liberated amoebae pass into the large intestine. Here, they
invade the epithelium of the mucosa, reach the submucosa
and produce the characteristic flask-shaped ulcers.
Grossly, early intestinal lesions appear as small areas of
elevation on the mucosal surface. In advanced cases,
typical flask-shaped ulcers having narrow neck and broad
base are seen. They are more conspicuous in the caecum,
rectum and in the flexures (Fig. 20.32).

characteristically oval with their long axis parallel to the long axis of the
bowel. B, Blood picture in typhoid fever showing neutropenia and relative
lymphocytosis.

573
CHAPTER 20
The Gastrointestinal Tract
Microscopically, the ulcerated area shows chronic
inflammatory reaction consisting of lymphocytes, plasma
cells, macrophages and eosinophils. The trophozoites of
Entamoeba are seen in the inflammatory exudate and are
concentrated at the advancing margin of the lesion.
Intestinal amoebae characteristically have ingested red
cells in their cytoplasm. Oedema and vascular congestion
are present in the area surrounding the ulcers.
Complications of intestinal amoebic ulcers are: amoebic
liver abscess or amoebic hepatitis, perforation, haemorrhage
and formation of amoeboma which is a tumour-like mass.
PSEUDOMEMBRANOUS ENTEROCOLITIS
(ANTIBIOTIC-ASSOCIATED DIARRHOEA)
Pseudomembranous enterocolitis is a form of acute
inflammation of colon and/or small intestine characterised
by formation of ‘pseudomembrane’ over the site of mucosal
injury.
ETIOLOGY. Numerous studies have established the
overgrowth of Clostridium difficile with production of its toxin
in the etiology of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea culminating
in pseudomembranous colitis. Oral antibiotics such as
clindamycin, ampicillin and the cephalosporins are more
often (20%) associated with antibiotic-associated diarrhoea,
while development of pseudomembranous colitis may occur
in 1-10% cases.
Pseudomembrane formation may also occur in various
other conditions as under:
Staphylococcal enterocolitis
Bacillary (Shigella) dysentery
Candida enterocolitis
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the lesions may
be confined, to the large intestine or small intestine, or
both may be involved. The mucosa of the bowel is covered
by patchy, raised yellow-white plaques. Elsewhere, the
mucosa is congested and may show small mucosal
ulcerations.
Microscopically, the ‘pseudomembrane’ is composed of
network of fibrin and mucus, in which are entangled
inflammatory cells and mucosal epithelial cells. There is
focal necrosis of surface epithelial cells. The lamina propria
contains inflammatory cell infiltrate, mainly neutrophils.
The submucosa has congested capillaries and may show
microthrombi. The inflammation spreads laterally rather
than deeply.
MALABSORPTION SYNDROME
DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION
The malabsorption syndrome (MAS) is characterised by
impaired intestinal absorption of nutrients especially of fat;
some other substances are proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins
and minerals. MAS is subdivided into 2 broad groups:
Primary MAS, which is due to primary deficiency of the
absorptive mucosal surface and of the associated enzymes.
Secondary MAS, in which mucosal changes result
secondary to other factors such as diseases, surgery, trauma
and drugs.
Each of the two main groups has a number of causes listed
in Table 20.8.
CLINICAL FEATURES
The clinical manifestations of MAS vary according to the
underlying cause. However, some common symptoms are
as follows:
Figure 20.32

shows multiple ulcers some of which are deep and are flask-shaped
with narrow neck and broad base (arrow) containing necrotic tissue and
undermined margins. B, Trophozoites of Entamoeba histolytica are seen
at the margin of ulcer (arrow).

INVESTIGATIONS
When MAS is suspected on clinical grounds, the following
investigations (laboratory tests) and endoscopic biopsy) may
be carried out to confirm it:
I.
LABORATORY TESTS:
1.
Tests for fat malabsorption:
i)
Faecal analysis for fat content
ii) Microscopic analysis for faecal fat
iii) Blood lipid levels after a fatty meal
iv) Tests based on absorption of radioactive-labelled fat.
2.
Tests for protein malabsorption:

II. INTESTINAL MUCOSAL BIOPSY:
Mucosal biopsy of small intestine is essential for making the
diagnosis of MAS and also evaluation of  a patient on follow-
up. The availability of endoscopes has enabled easy viewing
of affected mucosa directly and taking mucosal biopsy under
vision; this has largely replaced the earlier per-oral Crosby-
Kugler capsule biopsy of small intestine. The biopsy should
first be examined under dissecting microscope before
histologic sectioning.
Normal villous (Fig. 20.33,A). Under the dissecting
microscope, the normal jejunal mucosa has tall, slender,

CHAPTER 20
The Gastrointestinal Tract
finger-shaped or leaf-shaped villi. It is lined by tall colum-
nar absorptive epithelium and has scattered lymphocytes
in the lamina propria.
Villous atrophy. Variable degree of flattening of intestinal
mucosa in MAS is the commonest pathological change in
mucosal pattern and is referred to as villous atrophy. It
may be of 2 types—partial and subtotal/total type.
Partial villous atrophy is the mild form of the lesion
in which villi fuse with each other and thus become short
and broad, commonly called as convolutions and irregular
ridges (Fig. 20.33,B). The epithelial cells show compen-
satory hyperplasia suggesting a turnover of these cells
(Fig. 20.34,A). Lamina propria shows increased cellular
infiltrate, predominantly of plasma cells.
Partial villous atrophy is commonly found in children
and adults with diarrhoea, parasitic infestations, Crohn’s
disease, ulcerative colitis and malabsorption due to drugs
and radiation injury.
Subtotal/Total villous atrophy is the severe form of the
lesion in which there is flattening of mucosa due to more
advanced villous fusion (Fig. 20.33,C). The surface
epithelium is cuboidal and there is increased plasma cell
infiltrate in the lamina propria (Fig. 20.34,B).
Subtotal and total villous atrophy is exhibited by a
number of conditions such as nontropical sprue, tropical
sprue, intestinal lymphomas, carcinoma, protein-calorie
malnutrition etc.
IMPORTANT  TYPES OF MAS
Coeliac Sprue (Non-tropical Sprue, Gluten-Sensitive
Enteropathy, Idiopathic Steatorrhoea)
This is the most important cause of primary malabsorption
occurring in temperate climates. The condition is
characterised by significant loss of villi in the small intestine
and thence diminished absorptive surface area. The condition
occurs in 2 forms:
Childhood form, seen in infants and children and is
commonly referred to as coeliac disease.
Adult form, seen in adolescents and early adult life and used
to be called idiopathic steatorrhoea.
In either case, there is genetic abnormality resulting in
sensitivity to gluten (a protein) and its derivative, gliadin,
present in diets such as grains of wheat, barley and rye.
Serum antibodies—IgA antigliadin and IgA antiendomysial,
have been found but is not known whether these antibodies
are primary or appear secondary to tissue damage.
The symptoms are usually relieved on elimination of
gluten from the diet. The role of heredity is further supported
by the observation of familial incidence and HLA association
of the disease. Exact pathogenesis of the condition is not clear.
However, following hypotheses are significant in causing
mucosal cell damage:
1.
Hypersensitivity reaction as seen by gluten-stimulated
antibodies.
2.
Toxic effect of gluten due to inherited enzyme deficiency in
the mucosal cells.
Histologically, there are no differences in the pathological
findings in children and adults. There is variable degree
of flattening of the mucosa, particularly of the upper
jejunum, and to some extent of the duodenum and ileum.
The surface epithelial cells are cuboidal or low columnar
type. There may be partial villous atrophy which is
replacement of normal villous pattern by convolutions,
or subtotal villous atrophy characterised by flat mucosal
surface. Lamina propria shows increased number of
plasma cells and lymphocytes (Fig. 20.34).
The major sequela of long-term coeliac sprue is increased
incidence of intestinal carcinoma in these cases.
Collagenous Sprue
This entity is regarded as the end-result of coeliac sprue in
which the villi are totally absent (total villous atrophy) and
there are unique and diagnostic broad bands of collagen
under the basal lamina of surface epithelium. The condition
is refractory to any treatment and the course is generally fatal.
Some workers consider collagenous sprue as a variant of
coeliac sprue without classifying it separately.
Tropical Sprue
This disease, as the name suggests, occurs in individuals
living in or visiting tropical areas such as Caribbean
countries, South India, Sri Lanka and Hong Kong.
Pathogenesis of the condition is not clear but there is evidence
to support enterotoxin production by some strains of E. coli
which causes the intestinal injury. Severe cases are
characterised by additional features such as macrocytic
anaemia, glossitis and emaciation due to intestinal
malabsorption of vitamin B12 and folate.
Histologically, there is usually partial villous atrophy and
sometimes subtotal atrophy.
Figure 20.34

blunting of the villi with reduction in their height. There is crypt hyperplasia.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
The lesions are relieved by removal of the patient from
the tropical area and by oral administration of antibiotics
but gluten-free diet has no role in improvement.
Whipple’s Disease (Intestinal Lipodystrophy)
This is an uncommon bacterial disease involving not only
the intestines but also various other systems such as central
nervous system, heart, blood vessels, skin, joints, lungs, liver,
spleen and kidneys. The disease is more common in males
in 4th to 5th decades of life. Patients may present with
features of malabsorption or may have atypical presentation
in the form of migratory polyarthritis, neurological
disturbances and focal hyperpigmentation of the skin.
Histologically, the affected tissues show presence of
characteristic macrophages containing PAS-positive
granules and rod-shaped micro-organisms (Whipple’s
bacilli). These macrophages are predominantly present in
the lamina propria of the small intestine and mesenteric
lymph nodes.
Patients respond very well to oral antibiotic therapy.
Protein-Losing Enteropathies
A number of disorders of the gastrointestinal tract are
accompanied by excessive protein loss without concomitant
increase in protein synthesis, thus resulting in hypo-
proteinaemia. These diseases are listed below:
i)
Whipple’s disease
ii) Crohn’s disease
iii) Ulcerative colitis
iv) Sprue
v) Intestinal lymphangiectasia
vi) Ménétrier’s disease (Hypertrophic gastritis).
SMALL INTESTINAL TUMOURS
Although small intestine is about 6 meter long, but for
obscure reasons, benign as well as malignant tumours in it
are surprisingly rare. Most common benign tumours, in
descending order of frequency, are: leiomyomas, adenomas
and vascular tumours (haemangioma, lymphangioma).
Amongst the malignant tumours, the most frequently
encountered, in descending frequency, are: carcinoid
tumours, lymphomas (Fig. 20.35) and adenocarcinoma. All
these tumours are identical in morphology to those seen
elsewhere in the alimentary tract. Carcinoid tumour, a
peculiar neoplasm most common in the midgut, is described
below.
Carcinoid Tumour (Argentaffinoma)
Carcinoid tumour or argentaffinoma is a generic term applied
to tumours originating from endocrine cells (synonyms:
argentaffin cells, Kulchitsky cells, enterochromaffin cells)
belonging to APUD cell system and are therefore also called
as apudomas (page 561). The endocrine cells are distributed
throughout the mucosa of GI tract. These cells have secretory
granules which stain positively with silver salts (argentaffin
granules) or many stain after addition of exogenous reducing
agent (non-argentaffin or argyrophil granules). Accordingly,
carcinoid tumour may be argentaffin or argyrophil type.
Depending upon the embryologic derivation of the tissues
where the tumour is located, these are classified as foregut,
midgut, and hindgut carcinoids.
Midgut carcinoids, seen in terminal ileum and appendix
are the most common (60-80%) and are more often argentaffin
positive.
Hindgut carcinoids, occurring in rectum and colon are
more commonly argyrophil type, and comprise about 10-
20% of carcinoids.
Foregut carcinoids, located in the stomach, duodenum
and oesophagus are also argyrophil type and are encoun-
tered as frequently as in the hindgut (10-20%).
Other uncommon locations are the bronchus, trachea,
gallbladder, and Meckel’s diverticulum.
Appendix and terminal ileum, the two most common
sites for carcinoids, depict variation in their age and sex
incidence and biologic behaviour:
Appendiceal carcinoids, occur more frequently in 3rd
and 4th decades of life without any sex predilection, are often
solitary and behave as locally malignant tumours.
Ileal carcinoids, on the other hand, are seen more often
in later age (7th decade) with female preponderance, are more
commonly multiple and behave like metastasising
carcinomas.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, all carcinoids are
small, button-like submucosal elevations with intact or
ulcerated overlying mucosa. They are usually small; those
larger than 2 cm are more often metastasising. Ileal and
gastric carcinoids are commonly multiple, whereas
Figure 20.35

seen projecting into lumen while the covering mucosa is ulcerated.

577
CHAPTER 20
The Gastrointestinal Tract
appendiceal carcinoids commonly involve the tip of the
organ and are solitary (Fig. 20.36). Cut section of all the
carcinoids is bright yellow.
Histologically, the tumour cells may be arranged in a
variety of patterns—solid nests, sheets, cords, trabeculae
and clusters, all of which show characteristic palisading
of the peripheral cells. Acinar arrangement and rosettes
are rarely seen. The tumour cells are classically small,
monotonous, having uniform nuclei and poorly-defined
cell boundaries (Fig. 20.37). The argentaffin carcinoids
show eosinophilic granules in the cytoplasm which stain
positively by the argentaffin reaction. Mitotic figures are
rare. However, the cytologic features are a poor guide for
distinguishing clinically benign from malignant behaviour
of the tumour, but all carcinoids infiltrate the bowel wall.
CARCINOID SYNDROME. Carcinoid tumours that meta-
stasise, especially to the liver, are sometimes associated with
the carcinoid syndrome. The syndrome consists of the
following features:
1.
Intermittent attacks of flushing of the skin of face
2.
Episodes of watery diarrhoea
3.
Abdominal pain
4.
Attacks of dyspnoea due to bronchospasm
5.
Right-sided heart failure due to involvement of tricuspid
and pulmonary valves and endocardium (page 451).
A number of secretory products in a functioning carcinoid
tumour have been demonstrated:
i) 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin)
ii) 5-Hydroxytryptophan
iii) 5-Hydroxy-indole acetic acid (5-HIAA)
iv) Histamine
v) Kallikrein
vi) Bradykinin
However, 5-HT and its degradation product, 5-HIAA, are
particularly significant in the production of carcinoid
syndrome. 5-HT, a potent vasodilator and smooth muscle
stimulant, is normally synthesised in the endocrine cells of
the gut from dietary tryptophan. Tryptophan is first
hydroxylated to 5-hydroxytryptophan, then decarboxylated
to 5-HT and further oxidised to 5-HIAA by the monoamine
oxidase in the liver cells. It is then excreted in the urine. This
capacity to synthesise 5-HT and 5-HIAA is markedly elevated
in primary and hepatic metastatic carcinoids. Midgut
carcinoids have rich decarboxylating enzymes and are thus
able to produce large quantities of 5-HT and 5-HIAA,
accounting for high frequency of carcinoid syndrome in them.
Foregut and hindgut carcinoids, on the other hand, lack
decarboxylating enzymes and, therefore, are less often
associated with carcinoid syndrome.
APPENDIX
NORMAL STRUCTURE
Appendix is a vestigial organ which serves no useful purpose
in human beings but instead becomes the site of trouble at
times. It is like a diverticulum of the caecum, usually lying
behind the caecum and varies in length from 4 to 20 cm
(average 7 cm).

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Histologically, appendix has four layers in its wall—
mucosa, submucosa, muscularis and serosa. The mucosa has
patchy distribution of crypts and the submucosa has
abundant lymphoid tissue. Argentaffin and non-
argentaffin endocrine cells are present in the base of
mucosal glands just as in the small intestine. The muscu-
laris of the appendix has two layers (inner circular and
outer longitudinal) as elsewhere in the alimentary tract.
Two important diseases involving the appendix are
appendicitis and appendiceal carcinoids.
APPENDICITIS
Acute inflammation of the appendix, acute appendicitis, is
the most common acute abdominal condition confronting the
surgeon. The condition is seen more commonly in older
children and young adults, and is uncommon at the extremes
of age. The disease is seen more frequently in the West and
in affluent societies which may be due to variation in diet—
a diet with low bulk or cellulose and high protein intake more
often causes appendicitis.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The most common mechanism is
obstruction of the lumen from various etiologic factors that
leads to increased intraluminal pressure. This presses upon
the blood vessels to produce ischaemic injury which in turn
favours the bacterial proliferation and hence acute
appendicitis. The common causes of appendicitis are as
under:
A. Obstructive:
1.
Faecolith
2.
Calculi
3.
Foreign body
4.
Tumour
5.
Worms (especially Enterobius vermicularis)
6.
Diffuse lymphoid hyperplasia, especially in children.
B. Non-obstructive:
1.
Haematogenous spread of generalised infection
2.
Vascular occlusion
3.
Inappropriate diet lacking roughage.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the appearance
depends upon the stage at which the acutely-inflamed
appendix is examined. In early acute appendicitis, the organ
is swollen and serosa shows hyperaemia. In well-
developed acute inflammation called acute suppurative
appendicitis, the serosa is coated with fibrinopurulent
exudate and engorged vessels on the surface. In further
advanced cases called acute gangrenous appendicitis, there
is necrosis and ulcerations of mucosa which extend
through the wall so that the appendix becomes soft and
friable and the surface is coated with greenish-black
gangrenous necrosis (Fig. 20.38).
Microscopically, the most important diagnostic histological
criterion is the neutrophilic infiltration of the muscularis. In
early stage, the other changes besides acute inflammatory
changes, are congestion and oedema of the appendiceal
wall. In later stages, the mucosa is sloughed off, the wall
becomes necrotic, the blood vessels may get thrombosed
and there may be neutrophilic abscesses in the wall. In
either case, an impacted foreign body, faecolith, or con-
cretion may be seen in the lumen (Fig. 20.39).

opened appendix showing impacted faecolith in the lumen and exudate

present are necrosis of mucosa and periappendicitis.

579
CHAPTER 20
The Gastrointestinal Tract
Thus, there is good correlation between macroscopic
and microscopic findings in acute appendicitis.
CLINICAL COURSE. The patient presents with features of
acute abdomen as under:
1.
Colicky pain, initially around umbilicus but later localised
to right iliac fossa
2.
Nausea and vomiting
3.
Pyrexia of mild grade
4.
Abdominal tenderness
5.
Increased pulse rate
6.
Neutrophilic leucocytosis.
An attack of acute appendicitis predisposes the appendix
to repeated attacks (recurrent acute appendicitis) and thus
surgery has to be carried out. If appendicectomy is done at a
later stage following acute attack (interval appendicectomy),
pathological changes of healing by fibrosis of the wall and
chronic inflammation are observed.
COMPLICATIONS. If the condition is not adequately
managed, the following complications may occur:
1.
Peritonitis. A perforated appendix as occurs in
gangrenous appendicitis may cause localised or generalised
peritonitis.
2.
Appendix abscess. This is due to rupture of an appendix
giving rise to localised abscess in the right iliac fossa. This
abscess may spread to other sites such as between the liver
and diaphragm (subphrenic abscess), into the pelvis between
the urinary bladder and rectum, and in the females may
involve uterus and fallopian tubes.
3.
Adhesions. Late complications of acute appendicitis are
fibrous adhesions to the greater omentum, small intestine
and other abdominal structures.
4.
Portal pylephlebitis. Spread of infection into mesenteric
veins may produce septic phlebitis and liver abscess.
5.
Mucocele. Distension of distal appendix by mucus
following recovery from an attack of acute appendicitis is
referred to as mucocele. It occurs generally due to proximal
obstruction but sometimes may be due to a benign or
malignant neoplasm in the appendix. An infected mucocele
may result in formation of empyema of the appendix.
TUMOURS OF APPENDIX
Tumours of the appendix are quite rare. These include:
carcinoid tumour (the most common), pseudomyxoma
peritonei and adenocarcinoma.
CARCINOID TUMOUR. It is already described on page 576.
Both argentaffin and argyrophil types are encountered, the
former being more common.
Grossly, carcinoid tumour of the appendix is mostly
situated near the tip of the organ and appears as a
circumscribed nodule, usually less than 1 cm in diameter,
involving the wall but metastases are rare.
Histologically, carcinoid tumour of the appendix
resembles other carcinoids of the midgut.
PSEUDOMYXOMA PERITONEI. Pseudomyxoma peritonei
is appearance of gelatinous mucinous material around the
appendix admixed with epithelial tumour cells. It is generally
due to mucinous collection from benign mucinous
cystadenoma of the ovary or mucin-secreting carcinoma of
the appendix.
ADENOCARCINOMA. It is an uncommon tumour in the
appendix and is morphologically similar to adenocarcinoma
elsewhere in the alimentary tract.
LARGE INTESTINE
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The large bowel consists of 6 parts—the caecum, ascending
colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon and
rectum, and in all measures about 1.5 meters in length. The
serosal surface of the large intestine except the rectum is
studded with appendices epiploicae which are small, rounded
collections of fatty tissue covered by peritoneum.
Histologically, the wall of large bowel consists of 4 layers as
elsewhere in the alimentary tract—serosa, muscularis,
submucosa and mucosa.
The mucosa lacks villi and there is preponderance of
goblet cells over columnar epithelial cells. The lymphoid
tissue is less abundant than in the small bowel but lymphoid
follicles are seen in the caecum and rectum.
The muscularis propria of the large intestine is quite
peculiar—the inner circular muscle layer ensheaths whole
length of the intestine, while the outer longitudinal muscle
layer is concentrated into 3 muscle bands called taenia coli.
The length of outer muscle layer is shorter than the length of
the intestine and therefore, it forms the sacculations or haustra
of the large intestine. At the rectosigmoid junction, the three
muscle bands fuse to form a complete covering.
The blood supply to the right colon is from the superior
mesenteric artery which also supplies blood to the small
bowel. The remaining portion of large bowel except the lower
part of rectum receives blood supply from inferior mesenteric
artery. The lower rectum is supplied by haemorrhoidal
branches.
The innervation of the large bowel consists of 3 plexuses
of ganglion cells—Auerbach’s or myenteric plexus lying
between the two layers of muscularis, Henle’s plexus lying in
the deep submucosa inner to circular muscle layer, and
Meissner plexus that lies in the superficial mucosa just beneath
the muscularis mucosae. These are interconnected by non-
myelinated nerve fibres.
Anal canal, 3-4 cm long tubular structure, begins at the
lower end of the rectum, though is not a part of large bowel,
but is included here to cover simultaneously lesions
pertaining to this region. It is lined by keratinised or
nonkeratinised stratified squamous epithelium. Anal verge
is the junction between the anal canal and perineal skin, while
pectinate line is the squamo-columnar junction between the
anal canal and the rectum.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS
Hirschsprung’s Disease (Congenital Megacolon)
The term ‘megacolon’ is used for any form of marked
dilatation of the entire colon or its segment and may occur
as a congenital or acquired disorder. Congenital form
characterised by congenital absence of ganglion cells in the
bowel wall (enteric neurons) is called Hirschsprung’s disease.
As a result, the aganglionic segment remains contracted.
Genetically, Hirschsprung’s disease is a heterogeneous
disorder as under:
1. Autosomal dominant inheritance with mutation in RET
proto-oncogene in some cases.
2. Autosomal recessive form with mutation in endothelin-B
receptor gene in many other cases.
Clinically, the condition manifests shortly after birth with
constipation, gaseous distension and sometimes with acute
intestinal obstruction. Its frequency is 1 in 5,000 live-births,
has familial tendency in about 4% of cases and has
predilection for development in Down’s syndrome.
Pathogenesis lies in the failure of neuroblasts to migrate to
the rectum which normally occurs at about 12 weeks of
gestation.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Two types of biopsies may
be done on infants suspected of having Hirschsprung’s
disease—full-thickness rectal biopsy, and suction biopsy
that includes mucosa and submucosa.
Grossly, typical case of Hirschsprung’s disease shows 2
segments—a distal narrow segment that is aganglionic and
a dilated proximal segment that contains normal number of
ganglion cells (Fig. 20.40).
Microscopically, the distal narrow segment shows total
absence of ganglion cells of all the three plexuses
(Auerbach’s or myenteric plexus present between the two
layers of muscularis, deep submucosal or Henle’s plexus,
and superficial mucosal or Meissner’s plexus) and
prominence of non-myelinated nerve fibres. Histo-
chemical staining for acetylcholine esterase activity
provides confirmation for identifying ganglion cells and
nerve trunks.
Depending upon the length of the segment affected by
aganglionosis in Hirschsprung’s disease, following patterns
are recognised:
1.
Classic form: Anganglionosis from distal colorectal region
to proximal dilated colon.
2.
Short segment (rectal and recto-sigmoid) form:  Aganglionosis
involving a few centimeters of the rectum and rectosigmoid
only.
3.
Ultra-short form: Aganglionosis is in a very small segment
which can be missed in a biopsy.
4.
Long segment (subtotal colonic) form: Aganglionosis
involves most of the colon from rectosigmoid to the ileo-
caecal valve, and sometimes may even extend into smll
bowel.
5.
Zonal colonic aganglionosis: A short segment is nvolved in
agnaglionosis in which the ganglia cells are absent both above
and below the aganglionic segment.
In addition to congenital megacolon discussed above,
megacolon may occur from certain acquired causes as under:
i.
Obstructive e.g. due to tumour, post-inflammatory
strictures.
ii. Endocrine e.g. in myxoedema, cretinism.
iii. CNS disorders e.g. spina bifida, paraplegia, parkinsonism.
iv. Psychogenic e.g. emotional disturbances, psychiatric
disorders.
v. Chagas’ disease due to infection with Trypanosoma cruzi is
the only example resulting in acquired loss of ganglion cells.
In all other acquired causes listed above, the bowel
innervation is normal.
COLITIS
Colitis may occur in isolation but more commonly
involvement of small intestine is also present (enterocolitis).
In view of the considerable overlapping of enteritis and
colitis, these lesions have already been described under small
intestine (page 578). Table 20.9 presents a classification of
the various types of colitis/enterocolitis.

CHAPTER 20
The Gastrointestinal Tract
MISCELLANEOUS LESIONS
Diverticulosis Coli
Diverticula are the outpouchings or herniations of the mucosa
and submucosa of the colon through the muscle wall.
Diverticular disease, as it is commonly known, is rare under
30 years of age and is seen more commonly as the age
advances. Multiple diverticula of the colon are very common
in the Western societies, probably due to ingestion of low-
fibre diet but is seen much less frequently in tropical countries
and in Japan. Diverticulosis is often asymptomatic and may
be detected as an incidental finding at autopsy. However, a
proportion of patients develop clinical symptoms such as
low abdominal pain, distension, constipation and sometimes
intermittent bleeding.
Based on the etiologic role of low fibre diet, pathogenesis
of diverticular disease of the colon can be explained as under:
1.
Increased intraluminal pressure such as due to low fibre
content of the diet causing hyperactive peristalsis and thereby
sequestration, of mucosa and submucosa.
2.
Muscular weakness of the colonic wall at the junction of
the muscularis with submucosa.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, diverticulosis is
seen most commonly in the sigmoid colon (95%) but any
other part of the entire colon may be involved. They may
vary in number from a few to several hundred. They
appear as small, spherical or flask-shaped outpouchings,
usually less than 1 cm in diameter, commonly extend into
appendices epiploicae and may contain inspissated faeces.
They are connected to the intestinal lumen by a narrow
neck.
Histologically, the flask-shaped structures extend from
the intestinal lumen through the muscle layer. The colonic
wall in the affected area is thin and is composed of atrophic
mucosa, compressed submucosa and thin or deficient
muscularis. However, muscularis propria in between the
diverticular protrusions is hypertrophied. While diverti-
cular disease may remain asymptomatic, inflammatory
changes in the diverticula (diverticulitis) produce clinical
symptoms.
The complications of diverticulosis and diverticulitis are
perforation, haemorrhage, intestinal obstruction and fistula
formation.
Melanosis Coli
Melanosis coli is a peculiar condition in which mucosa of
the large intestine acquires brown-black colouration. The
condition is said to occur in individuals who are habitual
users of cathartics of anthracene type.
Grossly, the mucosal surface is intact and is pigmented
brown-black.
Microscopically, large number of pigment-laden
macrophages are seen in the lamina propria. The nature
of this pigment is found to be both melanin and lipofuscin.
Haemorrhoids (Piles)
Haemorrhoids or piles are the varicosities of the haemorrhoi-
dal veins. They are called ‘internal piles’ if dilatation is of
superior haemorrhoidal plexus covered over by mucous
membrane, and ‘external piles’ if they involve inferior
haemorrhoidal plexus covered over by the skin. They are
common lesions in elderly and pregnant women. They
commonly result from increased venous pressure. The
possible causes include the following:
1.
Portal hypertension
2.
Chronic constipation and straining at stool
3.
Cardiac failure
4.
Venous stasis of pregnancy
5.
Hereditary predisposition
6.
Tumours of the rectum.
Microscopically, thin-walled and dilated tortuous veins
are seen under the rectal mucosa (internal piles) or anal
skin (external piles). Secondary changes and complications
that may occur include: thrombosis, haemorrhage,
inflammation, scarring and strangulation (prolapsed piles).
Angiodysplasia
Angiodysplasia is a submucosal telangiectasia affecting
caecum and right colon that causes recurrent acute and
chronic haemorrhage. The condition is more common in the
elderly past 6th decade. The pathogenesis is obscure but is
possibly due to mechanical obstruction of the veins.
MISCELLANEOUS INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS
‘Fistula-in-ano’ is a well known and common condition
in which one or more fistulous tracts pass from the internal
opening at the pectinate line through the internal sphincter
on to the skin surface. The condition probably results from
infection of the anal glands.
Histologically, nonspecific inflammatory changes are seen.
‘Anal fissure’ is an ulcer in the anal canal below the level
of the pectinate line, mostly in midline and posteriorly. The
common cause is trauma due to passage of hard stools,
followed by chronic infection.
‘Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome’ is a condition charac-
terised usually by solitary, at times multiple, rectal ulcers
with prolapse of rectal mucosa and development of proctitis.
The histological appearance is quite characteristic. Besides
ulceration and inflammation of the rectal mucosa, lamina
propria is occupied by spindle-shaped fibroblasts and smooth
muscle cells. The condition is also called as ‘localised form of
colitis cystica profunda’ and must be differentiated from ‘diffuse
form of colitis cystica profunda’ seen in cases of ulcerative colitis.
Submucosal cysts lined by foreign body giant cells and
containing gas are also seen in ‘pneumatosis cystoides
intestinalis’.
LARGE INTESTINAL POLYPS AND  TUMOURS
Large bowel is the most common site for a variety of benign
and malignant tumours, majority of which are of epithelial

582
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
origin. Most of the benign tumours present clinically as
polyps. A classification of polyps, alongwith benign tumours
and malignant tumours, is presented in Table 20.10.
COLORECTAL POLYPS
A polyp is defined as any growth or mass protruding from
the mucous membrane into the lumen. Polyps are much more
common in the large intestine than in the small intestine and
are more common in the rectosigmoid colon than the
proximal colon. Polyps are broadly classified into 2 groups—
non-neoplastic and neoplastic. Non-neoplastic polyps have
further subtypes indicating their mode of origin. Neoplastic
polyps, on the other hand, include epithelial tumours, both
benign and malignant (Table 20.10).
A. NON-NEOPLASTIC POLYPS
Non-neoplastic polyps are more common and include the
following 4 subtypes:
Hyperplastic (Metaplastic) Polyps
The hyperplastic or metaplastic polyps are the most common
amongst all epithelial polyps, particularly in the
rectosigmoid. They are called ‘hyperplastic’ because there is
epithelial hyperplasia at the base of the crypts, and
‘metaplastic’ as there are areas of cystic metaplasia. They may
be seen at any age but are more common in the elderly
(6th-7th decade).
Grossly, hyperplastic polyps are generally multiple,
sessile, smooth-surfaced and small (less than 0.5 cm).
Microscopically, they are composed of long and cystically
dilated glands and crypts lined by normal epithelial cells.
Their lining is partly flat and partly papillary. The luminal
border of the lining epithelium is often serrated or saw-
toothed.
Hyperplastic polyps are usually symptomless and have
no malignant potential unless there is a coexistent adenoma.
Hamartomatous Polyps
These are tumour-like lesions composed of abnormal mixture
of tissues indigenous to the part. They are further of 2 types:
PEUTZ-JEGHERS POLYPS AND POLYPOSIS. Peutz-
Jeghers syndrome is autosomal dominant defect, charac-
terised by hamartomatous intestinal polyposis and melanotic
pigmentation of lips, mouth and genitalia. The polyps may
be located in the stomach, small intestine or colon but are
most common in the jejunum and ileum. The most common
age is adolescence and early childhood.
Grossly, these polyps are of variable size but are often
large, multiple and pedunculated and more commonly
situated in the small intestine.
Microscopically, the most characteristic feature is the tree-
like branching of muscularis mucosae. The lining
epithelium is by normal-appearing epithelial cells. The
glands may show hyperplasia and cystic change
(Fig. 20.41).
Peutz-Jeghers polyps do not undergo malignant
transformation unless a coexistent adenoma is present.
However, patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome are more
prone to certain other cancers such as of pancreas, lung,
breast, ovary and uterus.
JUVENILE (RETENTION) POLYPS. Juvenile or retention
polyps, another form of hamartomatous polyps, occur more
commonly in children below 5 years of age. Solitary juvenile
polyps occur more often in the rectum, while juvenile
polyposis may be present anywhere in the large bowel.
Grossly, juvenile polyps are spherical, smooth-surfaced,
about 2 cm in diameter and are often pedunculated.
Microscopically, the classical appearance is of cystically
dilated glands containing mucus and lined by normal
mucus-secreting epithelium. The stroma may show
inflammatory cell infiltrate if there is chronic ulceration
of the surface (Fig. 20.42).
Most cases, on becoming symptomatic in the form of
rectal bleeding, are removed. In common with other non-
neoplastic polyps, they are also not precancerous.

CHAPTER 20
The Gastrointestinal Tract
Inflammatory Polyps (Pseudopolyps)
Inflammatory polyps or pseudopolyps appear due to re-
epithelialisation of the undermined ulcers and overhanging
margins in inflammatory bowel disease, most frequently in
ulcerative colitis (colitis polyposa) and sometimes in Crohn’s
disease.
Grossly, they are usually multiple, cylindrical to rounded
overgrowths of mucosa and may vary from minute
nodules to several centimeters in size.
Microscopically, the centre of inflammatory polyp
consists of connective tissue core that shows some
inflammatory cell infiltrate and is covered superficially
by regenerating epithelial cells and some cystically-dilated
glands.
These lesions have no malignant potential; carcinomas
seen in long-standing cases of ulcerative colitis arise in the
region of epithelial dysplasia and not from the polyps.
Lymphoid Polyps
Reactive hyperplasia of lymphoid tissue that is normally also
more prominent in the rectum and terminal ileum, gives rise
to localised or diffuse lymphoid polyps, also called rectal
tonsils. Localised form occurs more often in the rectum in
elderly, while diffuse form is seen at younger age and in
children.
Grossly, they are solitary or multiple, tiny elevated lesions.
Microscopically, they are composed of prominent
lymphoid follicles with germinal centres located in the
submucosa and mucosa, and are covered by epithelium
that may be inflamed.
They are benign lesions and have to be distinguished from
malignant lymphoma.
B. NEOPLASTIC POLYPS (ADENOMAS)
Neoplastic polyps are colorectal adenomas which have
potential for malignant change while polypoid carcinoma is

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
the term used for invasive epithelial tumours. Adenomas
have 3 main varieties (tubular, villous and tubulovillous),
each of which represents a difference in the growth pattern
of the same neoplastic process and variable biological
behaviour.
Tubular Adenoma (Adenomatous Polyp)
Tubular adenomas or adenomatous polyps are the most
common neoplastic polyps (75%). They are common beyond
3rd decade of life and have slight male preponderance. They
occur most often in the distal colon and rectum. They may
be found singly as sporadic cases, or multiple tubular
adenomas as part of familial polyposis syndrome with
autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Tubular adenomas
may remain asymptomatic or may manifest by rectal
bleeding.
Grossly, adenomatous polyps may be single or multiple,
sessile or pedunculated, vary in size from less than 1 cm
to large, spherical masses with an irregular surface.
Usually, the larger lesions have recognisable stalks.
Microscopically, the usual appearance is of benign
tumour overlying muscularis mucosa and is composed
of branching tubules which are embedded in the lamina
propria. The lining epithelial cells are of large intestinal
type with diminished mucus secreting capacity, large
nuclei and increased mitotic activity (Fig. 20.43,A).
However, tubular adenomas may show variable degree
of cytologic atypia ranging from atypical epithelium
restricted within the glandular basement membrane called
as ‘carcinoma in situ’ to invasion into the fibrovascular
stromal core termed as frank adenocarcinoma.
Malignant transformation is present in about 5% of
tubular adenomas; the incidence being higher in larger
adenomas.
Villous Adenoma (Villous Papilloma)
Villous adenomas or villous papillomas of the colon are much
less common than tubular adenomas. The mean age at which
they appear is 6th decade of life with approximatey equal
sex incidence. They are seen most often in the distal colon
and rectum, followed in decreasing frequency, by rest of the
colon.
Grossly, villous adenomas are round to oval exophytic
masses, usually sessile, varying in size from 1 to 10 cm or
more in diameter. Their surface may be haemorrhagic or
ulcerated.
Microscopically, the characteristic histologic feature is the
presence of many slender, finger-like villi, which appear
to arise directly from the area of muscularis mucosae. Each
of the papillae has fibrovascular stromal core that is
covered by epithelial cells varying from apparently benign
to anaplastic cells. Excess mucus secretion is sometimes
seen (Fig. 20.43,B).
Villous adenomas are invariably symptomatic; rectal
bleeding, diarrhoea and mucus being the common features.
The presence of severe atypia, carcinoma in situ and invasive
carcinoma are seen more frequently. Invasive carcinoma has
been reported in 30% of villous adenomas.
Tubulovillous Adenoma
(Papillary Adenoma, Villoglandular Adenoma)
Tubulovillous adenoma is an intermediate form of pattern
between tubular adenoma and villous adenoma. It is also
Figure 20.43
Adenomas (neoplastic polyps)—three main varieties.

585
CHAPTER 20
The Gastrointestinal Tract
known by other names like papillary adenoma and villo-
glandular adenoma. The distribution of these adenomas is
the same as for tubular adenomas.
Grossly, tubulovillous adenomas may be sessile or
pedunculated and range in size from 0.5-5 cm.
Microscopically, they show intermediate or mixed
pattern, characteristic vertical villi and deeper part
showing tubular pattern (Fig. 20.43,C).
The behaviour of tubulovillous adenoma is intermediate
between tubular and villous adenomas.
The contrasting features of non-neoplastic and neoplastic
colorectal polyps are given in Table 20.11.
C. FAMILIAL POLYPOSIS SYNDROMES
Familial polyposis syndromes are a group of disorders with
multiple polyposis of the colon with autosomal dominant
inheritance pattern. Important conditions included in familial
polyposis are:
1.
Familial polyposis coli (adenomatosis)
2.
Gardner’s syndrome
3.
Turcot’s syndrome
4.
Juvenile polyposis syndrome
Some other conditions in which multiple polyposis of
colon occur but do not have familial basis are Peutz-Jeghers
syndrome (hamartomatous), Cronkhite-Canada syndrome
(inflammatory), and nodular lymphoid hyperplasia. The
familial polyposis syndromes are as follows.
Familial Polyposis Coli (Adenomatosis)
This hereditary disease is defined as the presence of more
than 100 neoplastic polyps (adenomas) on the mucosal
surface of the colon; the average number is about 1000
(Fig. 20.44). Adenomatosis can be distinguished from
multiple adenomas in which the number of adenomas is
fewer, not exceeding 100. The condition has autosomal
dominant transmission and is due to germline mutations in
APC gene which results in occurrence of hundreds of
adenomas which progress to invasive cancer. The average
age at diagnosis is 2nd and 3rd decades of life with equal
incidence in both the sexes.
Grossly and microscopically, the commonest pattern is
that of adenomatous polyps (tubular adenomas)
discussed above.
The malignant potential of familial polyposis coli is very
high. Colorectal cancer develops virtually in 100% of cases
by age of 50 years if not treated with colectomy. This subject
of ‘adenoma-carcinoma sequence’ has been discussed again
on page 586.
Gardner’s Syndrome
Gardner’s syndrome is combination of familial polyposis coli
and certain extra-colonic lesions such as multiple osteomas
(particularly of the mandible and maxilla), sebaceous cysts

and connective tissue tumours. The number of polyps in
Gardner’s syndrome is generally fewer than in the familial
polyposis coli but their clinical behaviour is identical.
Turcot’s Syndrome
Turcot’s syndrome is combination of familial polyposis coli
and malignant neoplasms of the central nervous system.
Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome
Juvenile polyposis is appearance of multiple juvenile polyps
in the colon, stomach and small intestine but their number is
not as high as in familial polyposis coli. Family history in
some cases may show autosomal dominant inheritance
pattern, while it may be negative in others. They resemble
the typical juvenile polyps as regards their age (under 5
years), sex distribution and morphology. They lack the
malignant potential.
OTHER BENIGN TUMOURS
Some non-epithelial benign tumours that may rarely occur
in large intestine are leiomyomas, leiomyoblastoma, neuri-
lemmoma, lipoma and vascular tumours (haemangioma,
lymphangioma).
MALIGNANT COLORECTAL TUMOURS
A. Colorectal Carcinoma
Colorectal cancer comprises 98% of all malignant tumours
of the large intestine. It is the commonest form of visceral
cancer accounting for deaths from cancer in the United States,
next only to lung cancer. The incidence of carcinoma of the
large intestine rises with age; average age of patients is about
60 years. Cancer in the rectum is more common in males
than females in the ratio of 2:1, while at other locations in
the large bowel the overall incidence is equal for both sexes.
ETIOLOGY. As with most other cancers, etiology of
colorectal carcinoma is not clear but a few etiological factors
have been implicated:
1.
Geographic variations. The incidence of large bowel
carcinoma shows wide variation throughout the world. It is
much more common in North America, Northern Europe
than in South America, Africa and Asia. Colorectal cancer is
generally thought to be a disease of affluent societies because
its incidence is directly correlated with the socioeconomic
status of the countries. In Japan, however, colon cancer is
much less common than in the US but the incidence of rectal
cancer is similar.
2.
Dietary factors. Diet plays a significant part in the
causation of colorectal cancer:
i)
A low intake of vegetable fibre-diet leading to low stool
bulk is associated with higher risk of colorectal cancer.
ii) Consumption of large amounts of fatty foods by
populations results in excessive cholesterol and their
metabolites which may be carcinogenic.
iii) Excessive consumption of refined carbohydrates that
remain in contact with the colonic mucosa for prolonged
duration changes the bacterial flora of the bowel, thus
resulting in production of carcinogenic substances.
3.
Adenoma-carcinoma sequence. There is strong evidence
to suggest that colonic adenocarcinoma evolves from pre-
existing adenomas, referred to as adenoma-carcinoma
sequence (Fig. 20.45). The following evidences are cited to
support this hypothesis:
i)
In a case with early invasive cancer, the surrounding
tissue often shows preceding changes of evolution from
adenoma → hyperplasia → dysplasia → carcinoma in situ →
invasive carcinoma.
ii) Incidence of adenomas in a population is directly propor-
tionate to the prevalence of colorectal cancer.
iii) The risk of adenocarcinoma colon declines with endoscopic
removal of all identified adenomas.
iv) Peak incidence of adenomas generally precedes by some
years to a few decades the peak incidence for colorectal
cancer.
v) The risk of malignancy increases with the following
adenoma-related factors:
a) Number of adenomas: familial polyposis coli syndrome
almost certainly evolves into malignancy.
b) Size of adenomas: large size increases the risk.
c)
Type of adenomas: greater villous component associated
with higher prevalence.
4.
Hereditary non-polyposis colonic cancer (HNPCC or
Lynch syndrome).  HNPCC is an autosomal dominant
condition in which colorectal cancer is seen in at least two
generations of first-degree relatives before the age of 50 years,
without evidence of familial polyposis coli. There are germline
mutations in mismatch repair genes, human mutL homolog
abbreviated as hMLH2 located on chromosome 2 and hMLH1
on chromosome 3 resulting in DNA instability. In HNPCC,
colon cancer appears at a relatively younger age (<50 years),
association with multiple primary cancers at different sites
(e.g. endometrium, ovary), preferred location in proximal
colon and better prognosis than other sporadic colon cancer
cases.
5.
Other factors. Presence of certain pre-existing diseases
such as inflammatory bowel disease (especially ulcerative
colitis) and diverticular disease for long duration increase
the risk of developing colorectal cancer subsequently. It may
be recalled here that low fibre diet is implicated in the
pathogenesis of diverticular disease as well. Besides, there
is an etiologic role of tobacco smoking in development of
colorectal cancer in youger patients.
GENETIC BASIS OF COLORECTAL CARCINOGENESIS.
Studies by molecular genetics have revealed that there are
sequential multistep mutations in evolution of colorectal
cancer from adenomas by one of the following two
mechanisms:
1. APC mutation/ β
 β
 β
 β
 β-catenin mechanism. This pathway of
multiple mutations is generally associated with
morphologically identifiable changes as described above in
adenoma-carcinoma sequence. These changes are as under:
i) Loss of tumour suppressor APC (adenomatous polyposis coli)
gene located on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q) is present

587
CHAPTER 20
The Gastrointestinal Tract
Figure 20.45
Adenoma-carcinoma sequence—schematic diagram of molecular and morphologic evolution.
in 80% cases of sporadic colon cancer. Since the function of
APC gene is linked to β-catenin, loss of APC gene results in
translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus where it activates
transcription of other genes, mainly MYC and cyclin D1, both
of which stimulate cell proliferation.
ii) Point mutation in K-RAS gene follows loss of APC gene
and is seen in 10 to 50% cases of adenoma-carcinoma.
iii) Deletion of DCC gene located on long arm of chromosome
18 i.e. 18q (DCC for deleted in colorectal cancer) in 60-70%
cases of colon cancer.
iv) Loss of p53 tumour suppressor gene seen in 70-80% cases of
colon cancer.
2. Microsatellite instability mechanism. In this pathway
also, there are multiple mutations but of different genes,
and unlike APC mutation/β-catenin mechanism there are
no morphologically identifiable changes. This pathway
accounts for 10-15% cases of colon cancer. Basic mutation
is loss of DNA repair gene. This results in a situation in
which repetitive DNA sequences (i.e. microsatellites)
become unstable during replication cycle, termed
microsatellite instability, which is the hallmark of this
pathway. The significant DNA repair genes which are
mutated in colon cancer are as under:
i) TGF-β receptor gene which normally inhibits cell
proliferation but in mutated form allows the uncontrolled
proliferation of colonic epithelium in adenoma.
ii) BAX gene which normally causes apoptosis but a defect in
it results in loss of apoptosis and dysregulated growth.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Distribution of the primary
colorectal cancer reveals that about 60% of the cases occur
in the rectum, followed in descending order, by sigmoid
and descending colon (25%), caecum and ileocaecal valve
(10%); ascending colon, hepatic and splenic flexures (5%);
and quite uncommonly in the transverse colon (Fig. 20.46).
Grossly, there are distinct differences between the growth
on the right and left half of the colon (Fig. 20.47).
Figure 20.46
Distribution of the primary colorectal cancer.

588
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Right-sided colonic growths tend to be large, cauli-
flower-like, soft and friable masses projecting into the
lumen (fungating polypoid carcinoma).
Left-sided colonic growths, on the other hand, have
napkin-ring configuration i.e. they encircle the bowel wall
circumferentially with increased fibrous tissue forming
annular ring, and have central ulceration on the surface
with slightly elevated margins (carcinomatous ulcers).
These differences in right and left colonic growths are
probably due to the liquid nature of the contents in the
ascending colon leaving space for luminal growth on right
side, while the contents in left colon are more solid
permitting the spread of growth into the bowel wall.
However, early lesion in left as well as right colon are
small, button-like areas of elevation.
Microscopically, the appearance of right and left-sided
growths is similar. About 95% of colorectal carcinomas
are adenocarcinomas of varying grades of differentiation,
out of which approximately 10% are mucin-secreting
colloid carcinomas (Fig. 20.48). The remaining 5% tumours
include uncommon microscopic patterns like undifferen-
tiated carcinoma, signet-ring cell carcinoma, and adeno-
squamous carcinomas seen in more distal colon near the
anus. The histologic grades indicating the degree of
differentiation are: well-differentiated, moderately-
differentiated and poorly-differentiated.
SPREAD. Carcinoma of the large intestine may spread by
the following routes:
1.
Direct spread. The tumour spreads most commonly by
direct extension in both ways— circumferentially into the

CHAPTER 20
The Gastrointestinal Tract
bowel wall as well as directly into the depth of the bowel
wall to the serosa, pericolic fat, and sometimes into peritoneal
cavity.
2.
Lymphatic spread. Spread via lymphatics occurs rather
commonly and involves, firstly the regional lymph nodes in
the vicinity of the tumour, and then into other groups of
lymph nodes like preaortic, internal iliac and the sacral lymph
nodes.
3.
Haematogenous spread. Blood spread of large bowel
cancer occurs relatively late and involves the liver, lungs,
brain, bones and ovary.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Clinical symptoms in colorectal
cancer appear after considerable time. These are as follows:
i)
Occult bleeding (melaena)
ii) Change in bowel habits, more often in left-sided growth
iii) Loss of weight (cachexia)
iv) Loss of appetite (anorexia)
v) Anaemia, weakness, malaise.
The most common complications are obstruction and
haemorrhage; less often perforation and secondary infection
may occur. Aside from the diagnostic methods like stool test
for occult blood, PR examination, proctoscopy, radiographic
contrast studies and CT scan, recently the role of tumour-
markers has been emphasised. Of particular importance is
the estimation of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level
which is elevated in 100% cases of metastatic colorectal
cancers, while it is positive in 20-40% of early lesions, and
60-70% of advanced primary lesions. However, the test may
have prognostic significance only and is not diagnostic of
colorectal cancer because it is positive in other cancers too
such as of the lungs, breast, ovary, urinary bladder and
prostate. CEA levels are elevated in some non-neoplastic
conditions also like in ulcerative colitis, pancreatitis and
alcoholic cirrhosis.
STAGING AND PROGNOSIS. The prognosis of colorectal
cancer depends upon a few variables:
i)
Extent of the bowel involvement
ii) Presence or absence of metastases
iii) Histologic grade of the tumour
iv) Location of the tumour
The most important prognostic factor in colorectal cancer
is, however, the stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis.
Three staging systems are in use:
1.
Dukes’ ABC staging (modified Duke’s includes stage D as
well).
2.
Astler-Coller staging which is a further modification of
Duke’s staging and is most widely used.
3.
TNM staging described by American Joint Committee is
also used.
Table 20.12 and Fig. 20.49 sum up the features of staging
classification and the overall 5-year survival rate in disease
stage.
B. Other Colorectal Malignant Tumours
Aside from colorectal carcinoma, other malignant tumours
which are encountered sometimes in the large bowel are
leiomyosarcoma (page 737) and malignant lymphoma (page
559). Hindgut carcinoids may occur in the rectum and colon
(page 576).
TUMOURS OF THE ANAL CANAL
Epithelial tumours of the anal canal are uncommon and may
be combination of several histological types. Amongst the
benign tumours of the anal canal, multiple viral warts called
as condyloma acuminata are the only tumours of note.
Malignant tumours of the anal canal include the following:
1.
Squamous cell carcinoma (Fig. 20.50)
2.
Basaloid carcinoma

diseases. Table 20.13 summarises the main causes of
gastrointestinal bleeding.
PERITONEUM
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The peritoneal cavity is lined by a layer of surface meso-
thelium derived from mesoderm. The lining rests on
vascularised subserosal fibrous tissue. Other structures
topographically related to peritoneum are retroperitoneum,
omentum, mesentery and umbilicus. These structures are
involved in a variety of pathologic states but a few important
conditions included below are inflammation (peritonitis),
tumour-like lesions (idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis and
mesenteric cysts) and tumours (primary and metastatic).
PERITONITIS
Inflammatory involvement of the peritoneum may result
from chemical agents or bacteria.
1.
Chemical peritonitis can be caused by the following:
Bile extravasated due to trauma or diseases of the
gallbladder.
Pancreatic secretions released from pancreas in acute
haemorrhagic pancreatitis.
Gastric juice leaked from perforation of stomach.
Barium sulfate from perforation of bowel during
radiographic studies.
Chemical peritonitis is localised or generalised sterile
inflammation of the peritoneum.
2.
Bacterial peritonitis may be primary or secondary; the
latter being more common.
Primary form is caused by streptococcal infection,
especially in children. Secondary bacterial peritonitis may
occur from the following disorders:
Appendicitis
Cholecystitis
Salpingitis

MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES Depending upon duration,
the features in bacterial peritonitis vary. It may be
generalised or may get localised by omentum such as in
appendiceal abscess following acute appendicitis. Depen-
ding upon duration, the fluid accumulation varies from
serous, turbid, creamy to frankly suppurative. The fluid
may eventually resolve or may heal by organisation with
formation of fibrous adhesions.
IDIOPATHIC RETROPERITONEAL FIBROSIS
Also known as Ormond’s disease or sclerosing retro-
peritonitis, this rare entity of unknown etiology is characteri-
sed by diffuse fibrous overgrowth and chronic inflammation.
The condition is, therefore, more like inflammatory rather
than neoplastic in origin. It may be associated with similar
process in the mediastinum, sclerosing cholangitis and
Riedel’s thyroiditis and termed multifocal fibrosclerosis.
Though idiopathic, the etiologic role of ergot derivative drugs
and autoimmune reaction has been suggested.
MESENTERIC CYSTS
Mesenteric cysts of unknown etiology and varying sizes may
be found in the peritoneal cavity. On the basis of their
possible origin, they are of various types:
Chylous cyst is a thin-walled cyst arising from lymph
vessels and lined by endothelium.
Pseudocysts are those which are formed following walled-
off infection or pancreatitis.
Neoplastic cysts occur due to cystic change in tumours.
TUMOURS
Peritoneum may be involved in malignant tumours—
primary and metastatic.
Mesothelioma is an example of primary peritoneal
tumour (benign and malignant) and is similar in morphology
as in pleural cavity (page 505).
Intra-abdominal desmoplastic small cell tumour is a
recently described highly malignant tumour belonging to the
group of other round cell or blue cell tumours such as small
cell carcinoma lung, Ewing’s sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma,
neuroblastoma and others.
Metastatic peritoneal tumours are quite common and
may occur from dissemination from any intra-abdominal
malignancy.

Systemic Pathology
The Liver, Biliary Tract and
Exocrine Pancreas
Chapter 21
Chapter 21
LIVER
NORMAL STRUCTURE
ANATOMY. The liver is the largest organ in the body
weighing 1400-1600 gm in the males and 1200-1400 gm in
the females. There are 2 main anatomical lobes—right and
left, the right being about six times the size of the left lobe.
The right lobe has quadrate lobe on its inferior surface and a
caudate lobe on the posterior surface. The right and left lobes
are separated anteriorly by a fold of peritoneum called the
falciform ligament, inferiorly by the fissure for the ligamentum
teres, and posteriorly by the fissure for the ligamentum
venosum (Fig. 21.1).
The porta hepatis is the region on the inferior surface of
the right lobe where blood vessels, lymphatics and common
hepatic duct form the hilum of the liver. A firm smooth layer
of connective tissue called Glisson’s capsule encloses the liver
and is continuous with the connective tissue of the porta
hepatis forming a sheath around the structures in the porta
hepatis. The liver has a double blood supply—the portal vein
brings the venous blood from the intestines and spleen, and
the hepatic artery coming from the coeliac axis supplies
arterial blood to the liver. This dual blood supply provides
sufficient protection against infarction in the liver. The portal
vein and hepatic artery divide into branches to the right and
left lobes in the porta. The right and left hepatic ducts also
join in the porta to form the common hepatic duct. The
venous drainage from the liver is into the right and left
hepatic veins which enter the inferior vena cava. Lymphatics
and the nerve fibres accompany the hepatic artery into their
branchings and terminate around the porta hepatis.
HISTOLOGY. The hepatic parenchyma is composed of
numerous hexagonal or pyramidal classical lobules, each with
a diameter of 0.5 to 2 mm. Each classical lobule has a central
tributary from the hepatic vein and at the periphery are 4 to
5 portal tracts or triads containing branches of bile duct,
portal vein and hepatic artery. Cords of hepatocytes and
blood-containing sinusoids radiate from the central vein to
the peripheral portal triads. The functioning lobule or liver
acinus as described by Rappaport has a portal triad in the
centre and is surrounded at the periphery by portions of
several classical lobules. However, in most descriptions on
pathology of the liver, the term lobule is used in its classical
form.
The blood supply to the liver parenchyma flows from
the portal triads to the central veins. Accordingly, the hepatic
parenchyma of liver lobule is divided into 3 zones (Fig. 21.2):
Zone 1 or the periportal (peripheral) area is closest to the
arterial and portal blood supply and hence bears the brunt
of all forms of toxic injury.
Zone 3 or the centrilobular area surrounds the central vein
and is most remote from the blood supply and thus suffers
from the effects of hypoxic injury.
Zone 2 is the intermediate midzonal area.

CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
The hepatocytes are polygonal cells with a round single
nucleus and a prominent nucleolus. The liver cells have a
remarkable capability to undergo mitosis and regeneration.
Thus it is not uncommon to find liver cells containing more
than one nuclei and having polyploidy up to octoploidy. A
hepatocyte has 3 surfaces: one facing the sinusoid and the
space of Disse, the second facing the canaliculus, and the third
facing neighbouring hepatocytes.
The blood-containing sinusoids between cords of hepato-
cytes are lined by discontinuous endothelial cells and scatte-
red flat Kupffer cells belonging to the reticuloendothelial
system.
The space of Disse is the space between hepatocytes and
sinusoidal lining endothelial cells. A few scattered fat storing
Ito cells lie within the space of Disse.
The portal triad or tract besides containing portal vein
radicle, the hepatic arteriole and bile duct, has a few
mononuclear cells and a scanty connective tissue considered
to be extension of Glisson’s capsule. The portal triads are
surrounded by a limiting plate of hepatocytes.
The intrahepatic biliary system begins with the bile
canaliculi interposed between the adjacent hepatocytes. The
bile canaliculi are simply grooves between the contact
surfaces of the liver cells and are covered by microvilli. These
canaliculi join at the periphery of the lobule to drain
eventually into terminal bile ducts or ductules (canal of
Hering) which are lined by cuboidal epithelium.
FUNCTIONS. The liver performs multifold functions. These
are briefly listed below:
1.
Manufacture and excretion of bile.
2.
Manufacture of several major plasma proteins such as
albumin, fibrinogen and prothrombin.
3.
Metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates and lipids.
4.
Storage of vitamins (A, D and B12) and iron.
5.
Detoxification of toxic substances such as alcohol and
drugs.
LIVER FUNCTION  TESTS
In view of multiplicity and complexity of the liver functions,
it is obvious that no single test can establish the disturbance
in liver function. Thus a battery of liver function tests are
employed for accurate diagnosis, to assess the severity of
damage, to judge prognosis and to evaluate therapy. These
tests are described below in relation to major liver functions.
A summary of various liver function tests is given in
Table 21.1.
I.
TESTS FOR  MANUFACTURE AND
EXCRETION OF BILE
Bile is produced by the liver, stored in the gallbladder and
secreted via biliary ducts into the duodenum. Bile consists
of biliary phospholipids and primary and secondary bile
acids. To understand the mechanisms underlying biliary
pathology, it is important to understand normal bilirubin
metabolism (page 596). In brief, jaundice will develop if
bilirubin is excessively produced, or there is impaired hepatic
uptake and conjugation of bilirubin, or it is insufficiently
excreted into the duodenum. Tests employed to assess the
synthesis and elimination of bilirubin pigment, urobilino-
gen and bile acids are as follows:
1.
BILIRUBIN. Bilirubin pigment can be detected in serum,
faeces and urine.
i)
Serum bilirubin estimation is based on van den Bergh
diazo reaction by spectrophotometric method. Diazo reagent
consists of diazotised sulfanilic acid. Water-soluble conjugated
bilirubin gives direct van den Bergh reaction with diazo
reagent within one minute, whereas alcohol-soluble
unconjugated bilirubin is determined by indirect van den
Bergh reaction. Addition of alcohol to the reaction mixture
gives positive test for both conjugated and unconjugated
bilirubin pigment. The unconjugated bilirubin level is then
estimated by subtracting direct bilirubin value from this total
value. The serum of normal adults contains less than 1 mg/
dl of total bilirubin, out of which less than 0.25 mg/dl is
conjugated bilirubin. Bilirubin level rises in diseases of
hepatocytes, obstruction to biliary excretion into the
duodenum, in haemolysis, and defects of hepatic uptake and
conjugation of bilirubin  pigment such as in Gilbert’s disease.
ii) In faeces, excretion of bilirubin is assessed by inspection
of stools. Clay-coloured stool due to absence of faecal
excretion of the pigment indicates obstructive jaundice.
iii) In urine, conjugated bilirubin can be detected by
commercially available ‘dipsticks’, Fouchet’s test, foam test
or ictotest tablet method. Bilirubinuria does not occur in
normal subjects nor is unconjugated bilirubin excreted in the
urine. Bilirubinuria occurs only when there is raised level of
conjugated bilirubin (filterable). Its excretion depends upon
the level of conjugated bilirubin in plasma that is not protein-
bound and is therefore available for glomerular filtration.
Bilirubinuria appears in patients of hepatitis before the
patient becomes jaundiced.
2.
UROBILINOGEN. Urobilinogen is normally excreted in
the urine. Its semiquantitative estimation in the urine can be
done by preparing dilutions with Ehrlich’s aldehyde reagent
or by ‘dipstick’ method. An increase in urobilinogen in the
urine is found in hepatocellular dysfunctions such as in
alcoholic liver disease, cirrhosis and malignancy of the liver.
It is also raised in haemolytic disease and in pyrexia. In
cholestatic jaundice due to complete biliary obstruction,
urobilinogen disappears from the urine.
3.
BROMSULPHALEIN EXCRETION. Bromsulphalein
(BSP) is a dye which is removed from circulation by the same
mechanisms of binding, conjugation and excretion as
bilirubin. BSP is injected intravenously and a sample of
venous blood 45 minutes later is tested for percentage of
injected dye remaining in the blood. The test is rarely
performed nowadays because of the availability of enzyme
estimations which are better indicators of hepatic
dysfunction. Presently, the only value of BSP excretion test
is in the diagnosis of Dubin-Johnson’s syndrome (page 601).
4.
BILE ACIDS (BILE SALTS). The primary bile acids
(cholic acid and cheno-deoxycholic acid) are formed from
cholesterol in the hepatocytes. These bile acids on secretion
into the gut come in contact with colonic bacteria and
undergo deconjugation with the production of secondary bile

splenomegaly; long-standing hepatitis; PUO and SOLs of the liver
acids (deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid). Most of these
bile acids are reabsorbed through enterohepatic circulation
and reach the liver. Only about 10% of the total bile acids
are excreted in the faeces normally as unabsorbable toxic
lithocholic acid.
Hepatobiliary diseases with cholestasis are associated
with raised levels of serum bile acids which are responsible
for producing itching (pruritus). These acids are excreted in
the urine by active transport and passive diffusion and can
be detected by simple methods as Hay’s test and ‘dipsticks’.

595
CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
II. SERUM ENZYME ASSAYS
Determination of certain serum enzymes is considered useful
in various types of liver injury, whether hepatocellular or
cholestatic, as well as in quantifying liver damage. A
combination of serum transaminases and alkaline
phosphatase estimation is adequate to diagnose liver injury.
1.
ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE. Serum alkaline phos-
phatase is produced by many tissues, especially bone, liver,
intestine and placenta and is excreted in the bile. Most of the
normal serum alkaline phosphatase (range 33-96 U/L) is
derived from bone. Elevation in activity of the enzyme can
thus be found in diseases of bone, liver and in pregnancy. In
the absence of bone disease and pregnancy, an elevated
serum alkaline phosphatase levels generally reflect
hepatobiliary disease. The greatest elevation (3 to 10 times
normal) occurs in biliary tract obstruction. Slight to moderate
increase is seen in parenchymal liver diseases such as in
hepatitis and cirrhosis and in metastatic liver disease. It is
possible to distinguish serum hepatic alkaline phosphatase
from bony alkaline phosphatase by fractionation into
isoenzymes but this is not routinely done.
2.
γγγγγ-GLUTAMYL TRANSPEPTIDASE (γγγγγ-GT). The
primary source of the enzyme, γ-GT, in serum is the liver.
Its serum level parallels serum alkaline phosphatase and is
used to confirm that the elevated serum alkaline phosphatase
is of hepatobiliary origin. Besides its elevation in cholestasis
and hepatocellular disease, the levels are high in patients
with alcohol abuse even without liver disease.
3.
TRANSAMINASES (AMINOTRANSFERASES).
Assessment of liver cell necrosis is most frequently done by
estimation of the following 2 serum enzymes:
i)
Serum aspartate transaminase or AST (formerly
glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase or SGOT): AST or SGOT
is a mitochondrial enzyme released from heart, liver, skeletal
muscle and kidney. Its normal serum level is 0.20-0.65
μkat/L (12-38 U/L).
ii) Serum alanine transaminase or ALT (formerly glutamic
pyruvic transaminase or SGPT): ALT or SGPT is a cytosolic
enzyme primarily present in the liver. Its normal serum level
is 0.12-0.70 μkat/L (7-41 U/L).
Serum levels of SGOT and SGPT are increased on damage
to the tissues producing them. Thus serum estimation of
SGPT (ALT) which is fairly specific for liver tissue is of
greater value in liver cell injury, whereas SGOT (AST) level
may rise in acute necrosis or ischaemia of other organs such
as the myocardium, besides liver cell injury.
Transaminase estimations are useful in the early
diagnosis of viral hepatitis. Very high levels are seen in
extensive acute hepatic necrosis such as in severe viral
hepatitis and acute cholestasis. Alcoholic liver disease and
cirrhosis are associated with mild to moderate elevation of
transaminases.
4.
OTHER SERUM ENZYMES. The determination of a few
other serum enzymes is done sometimes but without any
extra diagnostic advantage over the above mentioned
enzyme assays. These are as under:
i)
5'-Nucleotidase is another phosphatase derived from the
liver. Its determination is useful to distinguish alkaline
phosphatase of hepatic origin from that of bony tissue.
ii) Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) is found to be elevated  in
serum of patients with metastatic liver involvement.
iii) Choline esterase synthesised by the liver is diminished in
hepatocellular disease and malnutrition due to impaired
synthesis.
III. TESTS FOR METABOLIC FUNCTIONS
The liver is the principal site of metabolism and synthesis of
plasma proteins and amino acids, lipids and lipoproteins,
carbohydrates and vitamins, besides detoxification of drugs
and alcohol.
1. AMINO ACID AND PLASMA PROTEIN META-
BOLISM. Amino acids derived from the diet and from
tissue breakdown are metabolised in the liver to ammonia
and urea. A number of plasma proteins and immuno-
globulins are synthesised on polyribosomes bound to the
rough endoplasmic reticulum within the hepatocytes and
discharged into plasma. Based on these metabolic functions
of the liver, serum estimation of proteins, immunoglobulins
and ammonia and aminoaciduria are employed to assess
the liver cell damage.
i)
Serum proteins. Liver cells synthesise albumin,
fibrinogen, prothrombin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, haptoglobin,
ceruloplasmin, transferrin, alpha fetoproteins and acute
phase reactant proteins. The blood levels of these plasma
proteins are decreased in extensive liver damage. Routinely
estimated are total concentration of serum proteins (normal
6.7 to 8.6 gm/dl), serum albumin (normal 3.5 to 5.5 gm/dl),
serum globulin (normal 2 to 3.5 gm/dl) and albumin/
globulin (A/G) ratio (normal 1.5-3:1). Electrophoresis is used
to determine the proportions of α1, α2, β and γ globulins.
Due to the availability of protein electrophoresis, thymol
turbidity and flocculation tests based on altered plasma
protein components have been discontinued.
Hypoalbuminaemia may occur in liver diseases having
significant destruction of hepatocytes. Hyperglobulinaemia
may be present in chronic inflammatory disorders such as
in cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis.
ii) Immunoglobulins. The levels of serum immuno-
globulins produced by lymphocytes and plasma cells (IgG,
IgM and IgA) show nonspecific abnormalities in liver
diseases and represent inflammatory or immune response
rather than liver cell dysfunction. IgA is the predominant
immunoglobulin in bile and its level is raised in cirrhosis,
IgG is markedly raised in chronic active hepatitis and IgM
is markedly increased in primary biliary cirrhosis.
iii) Clotting factors. Hepatic synthetic function of several
clotting factors can be assessed by a few simple coagulation
tests. Prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time,
both of which reflect the activities of various clotting factors,
are prolonged in patients with hepatocellular disease.
Prothrombin time is dependent upon both hepatic synthesis
of clotting factors and intestinal uptake of vitamin K, a fat-
soluble vitamin. Thus, obstruction of the bile duct and intra-

596
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
hepatic cholestasis which result in vitamin K deficiency due
to impaired lipid absorption, are associated with prolonged
prothrombin time. However, parenteral injection of vitamin
K will normalise prothrombin time if the prolongation was
due to obstruction, but there will be no improvement in
prothrombin time if there is extensive hepatocellular disease.
iv) Serum ammonia. High blood levels of ammonia are
found in acute fulminant hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatic
encephalopathy. The rise in serum ammonia is due to
inability of severely damaged liver to convert ammonia to
urea. Thus, urea synthesis is reduced in chronic liver disease.
2.
LIPID AND LIPOPROTEIN METABOLISM. Lipids
synthesised in the liver include cholesterol and cholesterol
esters, phospholipids and triglycerides. These lipids are
insoluble in water and are carried in circulation with three
major types of lipoproteins which contain apoproteins. These
are: high density lipoproteins (HDL), low density
lipoproteins (LDL) and very low density lipoproteins
(VLDL).
Blood lipids. Estimations of total serum cholesterol,
triglycerides and lipoprotein fractions are frequently done
in patients with liver disease.
There is rise in total serum cholesterol in cholestasis,
probably due to retention of cholesterol which is normally
excreted in the bile (normal < 200 mg/dl). Serum triglyceride
is also elevated in cholestasis.
Values are lowered in acute and chronic diffuse liver
diseases and in malnutrition.
3.
CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM. The liver plays a
central role in carbohydrate metabolism. Blood glucose level
is lowered in fulminant acute hepatic necrosis. In chronic
liver disease, there is impaired glucose tolerance and relative
insulin resistance.
IV. IMMUNOLOGIC  TESTS
Liver diseases are associated with various immunologic
abnormalities which may be nonspecific immunologic reac-
tions or may be antibodies against specific etiologic agents.
1.
NONSPECIFIC IMMUNOLOGIC REACTIONS. These
include the following:
i)
Smooth muscle antibody to actin component of muscle is
formed in certain hepatic disorders with hepatic necrosis. It
appears that hepatocytes have a protein which is
immunologically similar to actin.
ii) Mitochondrial antibody develops in patients with primary
biliary cirrhosis.
iii) Antinuclear antibody is present in some patients of chro-
nic hepatitis. The LE cell test may be positive in these cases.
2.
ANTIBODIES TO SPECIFIC ETIOLOGIC AGENTS.
These vary according to the etiologic agent causing the liver
cell injury.
i)
Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) can be demonstrated
in cases of serum hepatitis. A confirmed positive test for
HBsAg is definite proof of hepatitis B infection.
ii) Hepatitis B core antibody (HBc) can be detected in all
patients with hepatitis B.
iii) Hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) can be found in chronic
varieties of hepatitis B.
iv) Amoeba antibodies to Entamoeba histolytica develop in
patients with amoebic liver abscess.
V. ANCILLARY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS
In addition to laboratory tests described above, two ancillary
tests which are invariably done by the physician  are
ultrasonography and percutaneous liver biopsy and/or
FNAC.
1.
ULTRASONOGRAPHY.  Ultrasound (US) examination
of the liver is indicated in the following situations:
i) Cholestasis of various etiologies to see the dilated intra-
and extrahepatic canalicular tree.
ii) Space-occupying lesions (SOLs) within the liver to
determine whether they are neoplasms or non-neoplastic
cysts.
iii) To provide US-guidance for FNAC or liver biopsy.
2. FNAC AND/OR PERCUTANEOUS LIVER BIOPSY.
Lastly, FNAC and percutaneous liver biopsy are employed
to examine the microscopic changes of hepatic morphology
in various diseases. Both these tests are done after evaluation
of signs of obstruction since these tests are contraindicated
in cholestasis. FNAC and liver biopsy are otherwise easily
performed bedside tests of value. Their main indications are
as follows:
i)
hepatocellular disease of unknown cause;
ii) suspected cases of chronic hepatitis;
iii) hepatomegaly of various etiologies;
iv) splenomegaly of unknown cause;
v) fever of unknown cause; and
vi) SOLs visualised in radiologic examination
JAUNDICE—GENERAL
Jaundice or icterus refers to the yellow pigmentation of the
skin or sclerae by bilirubin (page 42). Bilirubin pigment has
high affinity for elastic tissue and hence jaundice is
particularly noticeable in tissues rich in elastin content.
Jaundice is the result of elevated levels of bilirubin in the
blood termed hyperbilirubinaemia. Normal serum bilirubin
concentration ranges from 0.3-1.3 mg/dl, about 80% of which
is unconjugated. Jaundice becomes clinically evident when
the total serum bilirubin exceeds 2 mg/dl. A rise of serum
bilirubin between the normal and 2 mg/dl is generally not
accompanied by visible jaundice and is called latent jaundice.
Before considering the features and types of jaundice, it
is essential to review the normal bilirubin metabolism.
NORMAL BILIRUBIN METABOLISM
Normal metabolism of bilirubin can be conveniently
described under 4 main headings—source, transport, hepatic
phase and intestinal phase as illustrated schematically earlier
in Chapter 12 (see Fig. 12.9, page 291).
1.
SOURCE OF BILIRUBIN. About 80-85% of the bilirubin
is derived from the catabolism of haemoglobin present in
senescent red blood cells. The destruction of effete

597
CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
erythrocytes at the end of their normal lifespan of 120 days
takes place in the reticuloendothelial system in the bone
marrow, spleen and liver. The remaining 15-20% of the
bilirubin comes partly from non-haemoglobin haem-
containing pigments such as myoglobin, catalase and
cytochromes, and partly from ineffective erythropoiesis. In
either case, haem moiety is formed which is converted to
biliverdin by microsomal haem oxygenase for which oxygen
and NADPH are essential requirements. Bilirubin is formed
from biliverdin by biliverdin reductase.
2.
TRANSPORT OF BILIRUBIN. Bilirubin on release from
macrophages circulates as unconjugated bilirubin in plasma
tightly bound to albumin. Certain drugs such as
sulfonamides and salicylates compete with bilirubin for
albumin binding and displace bilirubin from albumin, thus
facilitating bilirubin to enter into the brain in neonates and
increase the risk of kernicterus. Bilirubin is found in body
fluids in proportion to their albumin content such as in CSF,
joint effusions, cysts etc.
3.
HEPATIC PHASE. On coming in contact with the
hepatocyte surface, unconjugated bilirubin is preferentially
metabolised which involves 3 steps: hepatic uptake,
conjugation and secretion in bile.
i)
Hepatic uptake: Albumin-bound unconjugated bilirubin
upon entry into the hepatocyte, is dissociated into bilirubin
and albumin. The bilirubin gets bound to cytoplasmic protein
glutathione-S-transferase (GST) (earlier called ligandin).
ii) Conjugation: Unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble
but is alcohol-soluble and is converted into water-soluble
compound by conjugation. Conjugation occurs in
endoplasmic reticulum and involves conversion to bilirubin
mono- and diglucuronide by the action of microsomal
enzyme, bilirubin- UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (Fig. 21.3).
The process of conjugation can be induced by drugs like
phenobarbital.
Conjugated bilirubin is bound to albumin in two forms:
reversible and irreversible. Reversible binding is similar to
that of unconjugated bilirubin. However, when present in
serum for a long time (e.g. in cholestasis, long-standing
biliary obstruction, chronic active hepatitis), conjugated
bilirubin is bound to albumin irreversibly and is termed delta
bilirubin or biliprotein. This irreversible conjugated delta
bilirubin is not excreted by the kidney, and remains
detectable in serum for sufficient time after recovery from
the diseases listed above.
iii) Secretion into bile: Conjugated (water-soluble) bilirubin
is rapidly transported directly into bile canaliculi by energy-
dependent process and then excreted into the bile.
4.
INTESTINAL PHASE. Appearance of conjugated
bilirubin in the intestinal lumen is followed by either direct
excretion in the stool as stercobilinogen which imparts the
normal yellow colour to stool, or may be metabolised to
urobilinogen by the action of intestinal bacteria. Conjugated
bilirubin is normally not reabsorbable whereas its metabolic
product, urobilinogen, is reabsorbed from the small intestine
and reaches enterohepatic circulation. Some of the absorbed
urobilinogen in resecreted by the liver into the bile while
the rest is excreted in the urine as urobilinogen.
The major differences between unconjugated and
conjugated bilirubin are summarised in Table 21.2.
CLASSIFICATION AND FEATURES OF JAUNDICE
Based on pathophysiology, jaundice may result from one or
more of the following mechanisms:
1.
Increased bilirubin production
2.
Decreased hepatic uptake
3.
Decreased hepatic conjugation
4.
Decreased excretion of bilirubin into bile
Accordingly, a simple age-old classification of jaundice
was to divide it into 3 predominant types: pre-hepatic
(haemolytic), hepatic, and post-hepatic cholestatic. However,
hyperbilirubinaemia due to first three mechanisms is mainly
unconjugated while the last variety yields mainly conjugated
hyperbilirubinaemia. Hence, currently pathophysiologic
classification of jaundice is based on predominance of the
type of hyperbilirubinaemia. A simple test to determine
whether hyperbilirubinaemia is of unconjugated or
conjugated variety is to determine whether bilirubin is
present in urine or not; its absence in urine suggests
unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia since unconjugated
Figure 21.3
Schematic representation of hepatic phase of bilirubin
transport.

598
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
bilirubin is not filtered by the glomerulus. The presence of
bilirubin in the urine is evidence of conjugated hyper-
bilirubinaemia.
Based on these mechanisms, the pathogenesis and main
features of the two predominant forms of hyperbiliru-
binaemia are discussed below (Table 21.3).
I.
Predominantly Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinaemia
This form of jaundice can result from the following three sets
of conditions:
1.
INCREASED BILIRUBIN PRODUCTION (HAEMO-
LYTIC, ACHOLURIC OR PREHEPATIC JAUNDICE). This
results from excessive red cell destruction as occurs in intra-
and extravascular haemolysis or due to ineffective
erythropoiesis. There is increased release of haemoglobin
from excessive breakdown of red cells that leads to
overproduction of bilirubin. Hyperbilirubinaemia develops
when the capacity of the liver to conjugate large amount of
bilirubin is exceeded. In premature infants, the liver is defi-
cient in enzyme necessary for conjugation while the rate of
red cell destruction is high. This results in icterus neonatorum
which is particularly severe in haemolytic disease of the
newborn due to maternal isoantibodies (Chapter 13). Since
there is predominantly unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia
in such cases, there is danger of permanent brain damage in
these infants from kernicterus when the serum level of
unconjugated bilirubin exceeds 20 mg/dl.
Laboratory data in haemolytic jaundice, in addition to
predominant unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, reveal
normal serum levels of transaminases, alkaline phosphatase
and proteins. Bile pigment being unconjugated type is absent
from urine (acholuric jaundice). However, there is dark
brown colour of stools due to excessive faecal excretion of
bile pigment and increased urinary excretion of urobilinogen.
2.
DECREASED HEPATIC UPTAKE. The uptake of
bilirubin by the hepatocyte that involves dissociation of the
pigment from albumin and its binding to cytoplasmic
protein, GST or ligandin, may be deranged in certain
conditions e.g. due to drugs, prolonged starvation and sepsis.
3.
DECREASED BILIRUBIN CONJUGATION. This
mechanism involves deranged hepatic conjugation due to
defect or deficiency of the enzyme, glucuronosyl transferase.
This can occur in certain inherited disorders of the enzyme
(e.g. Gilbert’s syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome), or
acquired defects in its activity (e.g. due to drugs, hepatitis,
cirrhosis). However, hepatocellular damage causes deranged
excretory capacity of the liver more than its conjugating
capacity (see below). The physiologic neonatal jaundice is also
partly due to relative deficiency of UDP-glucuronosyl
transferase in the neonatal liver and is partly as a result of
increased rate of red cell destruction in neonates.

CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
II. Predominantly Conjugated Hyperbilirubinaemia
(Cholestasis)
This form of hyperbilirubinaemia is defined as failure of
normal amounts of bile to reach the duodenum. Morpho-
logically, cholestasis means accumulation of bile in liver cells
and biliary passages. The defect in excretion may be within
the biliary canaliculi of the hepatocyte and in the microscopic
bile ducts (intrahepatic cholestasis or medical jaundice), or there
may be mechanical obstruction to the extrahepatic biliary
excretory apparatus (extrahepatic cholestasis or obstructive
jaundice). It is important to distinguish these two forms of
cholestasis since extrahepatic cholestasis or obstructive
jaundice is often treatable with surgery, whereas the
intrahepatic cholestasis or medical jaundice cannot be
benefitted by surgery but may in fact worsen by the
operation. Prolonged cholestasis of either of the two types
may progress to biliary cirrhosis (page 625).
1.
INTRAHEPATIC CHOLESTASIS. Intrahepatic
cholestasis is due to impaired hepatic excretion of bile and
may occur from hereditary or acquired disorders.
i)
Hereditary disorders producing intrahepatic obstruction
to biliary excretion are characterised by ‘pure cholestasis’ e.g.
in Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Rotor syndrome, fibrocystic
disease of pancreas, benign familial recurrent cholestasis,
intrahepatic atresia and cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy.
ii) Acquired disorders with intrahepatic excretory defect of
bilirubin are largely due to hepatocellular diseases and hence
are termed ‘hepatocellular cholestasis’ e.g. in viral hepatitis,
alcoholic hepatitis, and drug-induced cholestasis such as
from administration of chlorpromazine and oral
contraceptives.
The features of intrahepatic cholestasis include:
predominant conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia due to
regurgitation of conjugated bilirubin into blood, biliru-
binuria, elevated levels of serum bile acids and consequent
pruritus, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase,
hyperlipidaemia and hypoprothrombinaemia. ‘Pure choles-
tasis’ can be distinguished from ‘hepatocellular cholestasis’
by elevated serum levels of transaminases in the latter due
to liver cell injury.
Liver biopsy in cases with intrahepatic cholestasis reveals
milder degree of cholestasis than the extrahepatic disorders
(Fig. 21.4,A). The biliary canaliculi of the hepatocytes are
dilated and contain characteristic elongated green-brown bile
plugs. The cytoplasm of the affected hepatocytes shows
feathery degeneration. Canalicular bile stasis eventually
causes proliferation of intralobular ductules followed by
periportal fibrosis and produces a picture resembling biliary
cirrhosis (page 625).
2.
EXTRAHEPATIC CHOLESTASIS. Extrahepatic choles-
tasis results from mechanical obstruction to large bile ducts
outside the liver or within the porta hepatis. The common
causes are gallstones, inflammatory strictures, carcinoma
head of pancreas, tumours of bile duct, sclerosing cholangitis
and congenital atresia of extrahepatic ducts. The obstruction
may be complete and sudden with eventual progressive
obstructive jaundice, or the obstruction may be partial and
incomplete resulting in intermittent jaundice.
The features of extrahepatic cholestasis (obstructive jaun-
dice), like in intrahepatic cholestasis, are: predominant
conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, bilirubinuria, elevated
serum bile acids causing intense pruritus, high serum
alkaline phosphatase and hyperlipidaemia. However, there
are certain features which help to distinguish extrahepatic
from intrahepatic cholestasis. In obstructive jaundice, there
is malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E and K) and
steatorrhoea resulting in vitamin K deficiency. Prolonged
prothrombin time in such cases shows improvement
following parenteral administration of vitamin K, whereas
hypoprothrombinaemia due to hepatocellular disease shows
no such improvement in prothrombin time with vitamin K
administration. The stools of such patients are clay-coloured
due to absence of bilirubin metabolite, stercobilin, in faeces
and there is virtual disappearance of urobilinogen from the
urine. These patients may have fever due to high incidence
of ascending bacterial infections (ascending cholangitis).
Liver biopsy in cases with extrahepatic cholestasis shows
more marked changes of cholestasis (Fig. 21.4,B). Since the
obstruction is in the extrahepatic bile ducts, there is
progressive retrograde extension of bile stasis into
intrahepatic duct system. This results in dilatation of bile
Figure 21.4
Salient features in morphology of liver in intra- and extrahepatic cholestasis. A, Intrahepatic cholestasis is characterised by
elongated bile plugs in the canaliculi of hepatocytes at the periphery of the lobule. B, Extrahepatic cholestasis shows characteristic bile lakes due
to rupture of canaliculi in the hepatocytes in the centrilobular area.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
ducts and rupture of canaliculi with extravasation of bile
producing bile lakes. Since bile is toxic, the regions of bile
lakes are surrounded by focal necrosis of hepatocytes. Stasis
of bile predisposes to ascending bacterial infections with
accumulation of polymorphs around the dilated ducts
(ascending cholangitis). Eventually, there is proliferation of
bile ducts and the appearance may mimic biliary cirrhosis
(page 625).
NEONATAL JAUNDICE
Jaundice appears in neonates when the total serum bilirubin
is more than 3 mg/dl. It may be the result of unconjugated
or conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia; the former being more
common. Important causes of neonatal jaundice are listed
in Table 21.4. Some of these conditions are considered below,
while others are discussed elsewhere in the relevant sections.
HEREDITARY NON-HAEMOLYTIC
HYPERBILIRUBINAEMIAS
Hereditary non-haemolytic hyperbilirubinaemias are a small
group of uncommon familial disorders of bilirubin
metabolism when haemolytic causes have been excluded.
The commonest is Gilbert’s syndrome; others are Crigler-
Najjar syndrome, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Rotor’s
syndrome and benign familial recurrent cholestasis. The
features common to all these conditions are presence of
icterus but almost normal liver function tests and no well-
defined morphologic changes except in Dubin-Johnson
syndrome. Gilbert’s syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome
are examples of hereditary non-haemolytic unconjugated
hyperbilirubinaemia, whereas Dubin-Johnson syndrome,
Rotor’s syndrome and benign familial recurrent cholestasis
are conditions with hereditary conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.
These conditions are briefly described below. Their
distinguishing features are summarised in Table 21.5.
Gilbert’s Syndrome
This is the commonest of the familial, genetically-determined
diseases of the liver affecting 2-5% of the population. Gilbert’s
syndrome is characterised by mild, benign, unconjugated
hyperbilirubinaemia (serum bilirubin 1-5 mg/dl) which is
not due to haemolysis. The condition is inherited as an
autosomal dominant character. The defect in bilirubin
metabolism is complex and appears to be reduced activity
of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase with decreased
conjugation, or an impaired hepatic uptake of bilirubin. The
jaundice is usually mild and intermittent.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. There are no morphologic
abnormalities in the liver except some increased lipofuscin
pigment in centrilobular hepatocytes. The prognosis of
patients with Gilbert’s syndrome is excellent, though
chronic jaundice persists throughout life.

CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
Crigler-Najjar Syndrome
Crigler-Najjar syndrome is a rare form of familial non-
haemolytic jaundice with very high unconjugated hyper-
bilirubinaemia. There are 2 forms of this condition: type I and
type II.
Type I Crigler-Najjar syndrome. This is inherited as an
autosomal recessive disorder. There is complete absence of
conjugating enzyme UDP-glucuronosyl transferase in the
hepatocytes and hence no conjugated bilirubin is formed.
There is extreme elevation of unconjugated bilirubin (usually
more than 20 mg/dl) with high risk of developing permanent
CNS damage from kernicterus. The prognosis is generally
fatal, with death coming from kernicterus usually in the first
year of life.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. There are no significant
morphologic changes except some canalicular stasis.
Type II Crigler-Najjar syndrome. This is inherited as an
autosomal dominant disease. There is deficiency of enzyme
UDP-glucuronosyl transferase but not complete absence.
Thus, unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is generally mild
to moderate (usually less than 20 mg/dl). Occurrence of
kernicterus is exceptional and patients respond well to
phenobarbital therapy.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. There are no morphologic
changes in the liver.
Dubin-Johnson Syndrome
Dubin-Johnson syndrome is autosomal recessive disorder
characterised by predominant conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia
(usually less than 5 mg/dl) with genetic defect in canalicular
excretion of conjugated bilirubin. A prolonged BSP dye
excretion test is diagnostic of Dubin-Johnson syndrome
(page 593).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the condition
differs from other forms of hereditary hyperbili-
rubinaemias in producing greenish-black pigmented liver.
Microscopically, The hepatocytes show dark-brown,
melanin-like pigment in the cytoplasm, the exact nature
of which is obscure but it is neither iron nor bile. Unrelated
viral hepatitis mobilises the hepatic pigment of Dubin-
Johnson syndrome leading to its excretion in urine but
the pigment reappears after recovery from viral hepatitis.
The disease runs a benign course and does not interfere
with life.
Rotor’s Syndrome
This is another form of familial conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia
with mild chronic jaundice but differs from Dubin-Johnson
syndrome in having no brown pigment in the liver cells. The
disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive character. The
defect probably lies in intrahepatic storage of bilirubin but
the exact protein abnormality is not known.
Rotor’s syndrome has an excellent prognosis.
NEONATAL HEPATITIS
Neonatal hepatitis, also termed giant cell hepatitis or
neonatal hepatocellular cholestasis, is a general term used
for the constant morphologic change seen in conjugated
hyperbilirubinaemia as a result of known infectious and
metabolic causes listed in Table 21.4, or may have an
idiopathic etiology. ‘Idiopathic’ neonatal hepatitis is more
common and accounts for 75% of cases. Though all the cases
with either known etiologies or idiopathic type are grouped
together under neonatal hepatitis, all of them are not
necessarily inflammatory conditions, thus belying their
nomenclature as ‘hepatitis’. The condition usually presents
in the first week of birth with jaundice, bilirubinuria, pale
stools and high serum alkaline phosphatase.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Irrespective of the etio-
logy, there is morphologic similarity in all these cases. The
histologic features are as under:
1.
Loss of normal lobular architecture of the liver.
2.
Presence of prominent multinucleate giant cells
derived from hepatocytes.
3.
Mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate in the portal
tracts with some periportal fibrosis.
4.
Haemosiderosis.
5.
Cholestasis in small proliferated ductules in the portal
tract and between necrotic liver cells.
BILIARY ATRESIAS
Biliary atresias, also called as infantile cholangiopathies, are a
group of intrauterine developmental abnormalities of the
biliary system. Though they are often classified as congenital,
the abnormality of development in most instances is
extraneous infection during the intrauterine development or
shortly after birth that brings about inflammatory destruction
of the bile ducts. The condition may, therefore, have various
grades of destruction ranging from complete absence of bile
ducts termed atresia, to reduction in their number called
paucity of bile ducts.
Depending upon the portion of biliary system involved,
biliary atresias may be extrahepatic or intrahepatic.
Extrahepatic Biliary Atresia
The extrahepatic bile ducts fail to develop normally so that
in some cases the bile ducts are absent at birth, while in others
the ducts may have been formed but start undergoing
sclerosis in the perinatal period. It is common to have
multiple defects and other congenital lesions. Extrahepatic
biliary atresia is found in 1 per 10,000 livebirths. Cholestatic
jaundice appears by the first week after birth. The baby has
severe pruritus, pale stools, dark urine and elevated serum
transaminases. In some cases, the condition is correctable
by surgery, while in vast majority the atresia is not correc-
table and in such cases hepatic portoenterostomy (Kasai
procedure) or hepatic transplantation must be considered.
Death is usually due to intercurrent infection, liver failure,
and bleeding due to vitamin K deficiency or oesophageal
varices. Cirrhosis and ascites are late complications
appearing within 2 years of age.

602
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the liver is
enlarged and dark green. The atretic segments of biliary
system are reduced to cord-like structures.
Histologically, the condition must be distinguished from
idiopathic neonatal hepatitis as surgical treatment is
possible in extrahepatic biliary atresia but not in the latter.
Besides, α-1-antitrypsin deficiency also produces similar
appearance in liver biopsy. The main histologic features
are as under:
1.
Inflammation and fibrous obliteration of the
extrahepatic ducts with absence of bile in them.
2.
Ductular proliferation and periductular inflammation.
3.
Cholestasis and bile thrombi in the portal area.
4.
Periportal fibrosis and later secondary biliary cirrhosis
(page 625).
5.
Transformation of hepatic parenchyma to neonatal
(giant cell) hepatitis in 15% of cases.
Intrahepatic Biliary Atresia
Intrahepatic biliary atresia is characterised by biliary
hypoplasia so that there is paucity of bile ducts rather than
their complete absence. The condition probably has its origin
in viral infection acquired during intrauterine period or in
the neonatal period. Cholestatic jaundice usually appears
within the first few days of birth and is characterised by high
serum bile acids with associated pruritus, and
hypercholesterolaemia with appearance of xanthomas by
first year of life. Hepatic as well as urinary copper
concentrations are elevated. In some cases, intrahepatic
biliary atresia is related to α-1-antitrypsin deficiency.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The microscopic features
are as follows:
1.
Paucity of intrahepatic bile ducts.
2.
Cholestasis.
3.
Increased hepatic copper.
4.
Inflammation and fibrosis in the portal area,
eventually leading to cirrhosis.
REYE’S SYNDROME
Reye’s syndrome is defined as an acute postviral syndrome
of encephalopathy and fatty change in the viscera. The
syndrome may follow almost any known viral disease but
is most common after influenza A or B and varicella. Viral
infection may act singly, but more often its effect is modified
by certain exogenous factors such as by administration of
salicylates, aflatoxins and insecticides. These effects cause
mitochondrial injury and decreased activity of mitochondrial
enzymes in the liver. This eventually leads to rise in blood
ammonia and accumulation of triglycerides within
hepatocytes.
The patients are generally children between 6 months and
15 years of age. Within a week after a viral illness, the child
develops intractable vomiting and progressive neurological
deterioration due to encephalopathy, eventually leading to
stupor, coma and death. Characteristic laboratory findings
are elevated blood ammonia, serum transaminases, bilirubin
and prolonged prothrombin time.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the liver is enlar-
ged and yellowish-orange.
Microscopically, hepatocytes show small droplets of
neutral fat in their cytoplasm (microvesicular fat). Similar
fatty change is seen in the renal tubular epithelium and
in the cells of skeletal muscles and heart. The brain shows
oedema and sometimes focal necrosis of neurons.
HEPATIC FAILURE
Though the liver has a marked regenerative capacity and a
large functional reserve, hepatic failure may develop from
severe acute and fulminant liver injury with massive necrosis
of liver cells (acute hepatic failure), or from advanced chronic
liver disease (chronic hepatic failure). Acute hepatic failure
develops suddenly with severe impairment of liver functions
whereas chronic liver failure comes insidiously. The
prognosis is much worse in acute hepatic failure than that
in chronic liver failure.
ETIOLOGY. Acute and chronic hepatic failure result from
different causes:
Acute (fulminant) hepatic failure occurs most frequently
in acute viral hepatitis. Other causes are hepatotoxic drug
reactions (e.g. anaesthetic agents, nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, anti-depressants), carbon tetrachloride
poisoning, acute alcoholic hepatitis, mushroom poisoning
and pregnancy complicated with eclampsia.
Chronic hepatic failure is most often due to cirrhosis.
Other causes include chronic active hepatitis, chronic
cholestasis (cholestatic jaundice) and Wilson’s disease.
MANIFESTATIONS. In view of the diverse functions
performed by the liver, the syndrome of acute or chronic
hepatic failure produces complex manifestations. The major
manifestations are briefly discussed below and
diagrammatically illustrated in Fig. 21.5.
1.
Jaundice. Jaundice usually reflects the severity of liver
cell damage since it occurs due to failure of liver cells to
metabolise bilirubin. In acute failure such as in viral hepatitis,
jaundice nearly parallels the extent of liver cell damage, while
in chronic failure such as in cirrhosis jaundice appears late
and is usually of mild degree.
2.
Hepatic encephalopathy (Hepatic coma). Neuro-
psychiatric syndrome may complicate liver disease of both
acute and chronic types. The features include disturbed
consciousness, 
personality 
changes, 
intellectual
deterioration, low slurred speech, flapping tremors, and
finally, coma and death. The genesis of CNS manifestations
in liver disease is by toxic products not metabolised by the
diseased liver. The toxic products may be ammonia and other
nitrogenous substances from intestinal bacteria which reach
the systemic circulation without detoxification in the
damaged liver and thus damage the brain. Advanced cases
of hepatic coma have poor prognosis but may respond
favourably to hepatic transplantation.
3.
Hyperkinetic circulation. All forms of hepatic failure are
associated with a hyperkinetic circulation characterised by
peripheral vasodilatation, increased splanchnic blood flow

603
CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
and increased cardiac output. There is increased splenic flow
but reduced renal blood flow resulting in impaired renal
cortical perfusion. These changes result in tachycardia, low
blood pressure and reduced renal function.
4.
Hepatorenal syndrome. The term hepatorenal syndrome
is applied to patients of both acute and chronic hepatic failure
who develop renal failure as well, in the absence of clinical,
laboratory or morphologic evidence of other causes of renal
dysfunction. Hepatorenal syndrome develops in about 10%
cases of acute and chronic liver diseases. The acute renal
failure is usually associated with oliguria and uraemia but
with good tubular function. The histology of kidney is
virtually normal, suggesting functional defect for the renal
failure. The pathogenesis of the syndrome is poorly
understood but appears to be initiated by effective reduction
of the renal blood flow (effective hypovolaemia) as a
consequence of systemic vasodilatation and pooling of blood
in portal circulation. The renal failure in the hepatorenal
syndrome is reversible with improvement in hepatic
function.
Diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome should be made only
after excluding other causes producing concomitant damage
to both the organs, circulatory failure leading to acute tubular
necrosis and other forms of reversible tubular damage.
5.
Hepatopulmonary syndrome. The pulmonary changes
in chronic hepatic failure such as in cirrhosis consist of
pulmonary vasodilatation with intra-pulmonary
arteriovenous shunting. This results in ventilation-perfusion
inequality that may lead to impaired pulmonary function,
clubbing of fingers and sometimes cyanosis.
6.
Coagulation defects. Impaired synthesis of a number of
coagulation factors by the diseased liver may result in
coagulation disorders. These include disseminated
intravascular coagulation (consumption coagulopathy),
thrombocytopenia and presence of fibrin degradation
products in the blood.
7.
Ascites and oedema. Chronic liver failure due to cirrhosis
may result in portal hypertension and ascites (page 630).
Decreased synthesis of albumin by the liver resulting in
hypoproteinaemia and consequent fall in plasma oncotic
pressure, increased hydrostatic pressure due to portal
hypertension and secondary hyperaldosteronism, contribute
to the development of ascites and oedema in these patients.
8.
Endocrine changes. Endocrine changes may be found in
association with chronic hepatic failure. The changes are
more common in alcoholic cirrhosis in active reproductive
life. In the male, the changes are towards feminisation such
as gynaecomastia and hypogonadism. In the female, the
changes are less towards masculinisation but atrophy of
gonads and breasts occurs. The underlying mechanism
appears to be changed end-organ sensitiveness to sex
hormones in cirrhosis.
9.
Skin changes. In alcoholic cirrhosis ‘arterial spiders’
having radiating small vessels from a central arteriole are
frequent in the vascular region drained by superior vena cava
such as in the neck, face, forearms and dorsum of hands.
Less frequently, palmar erythema, especially in the hypothenar
and thenar eminences and on the pulps of the fingers, is
observed in chronic liver disease.
10. Foetor hepaticus. A sweetish pungent smell of the breath
is found in severe cases of acute and chronic hepatocellular
diseases. It appears to be of intestinal origin, possibly due to
failure of the liver to detoxify  sulfur-containing substances
absorbed from the gut.
CIRCULATORY DISTURBANCES
Vascular disorders of general nature involving the liver such
as chronic passive congestion and infarction have already
been discussed in Chapter 5. Hepatic and portal venous
obstruction and hepatic arterial obstruction are considered
here.
I.
HEPATIC VENOUS OBSTRUCTION
The central veins of lobules of the liver are tributaries of the
hepatic veins. In the normal liver, there are no anastomoses
between hepatic vein and portal vein but in cirrhotic liver
there are such anastomoses. Normal pressure in the free
hepatic vein is about 6 mmHg.
Two uncommon diseases produced by obstruction of the
hepatic veins are Budd-Chiari syndrome (hepatic vein
thrombosis) and hepatic veno-occlusive disease.
Budd-Chiari Syndrome (Hepatic Vein Thrombosis)
Budd-Chiari syndrome in its pure form consists of slowly
developing thrombosis of the hepatic veins and the adjacent
inferior vena cava, while some workers include hepatic veno-
occlusive disease (described below) in this syndrome.
ETIOLOGY. The etiology of hepatic venous thrombosis in
about a third of cases is unknown (idiopathic), while in the
Figure 21.5
Complications of hepatic failure.

604
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
remaining cases various causes associated with increased
thrombotic tendencies are attributed to polycythaemia vera,
paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, oral contraceptives,
pregnancy, postpartum state, intra-abdominal cancers (e.g.
hepatocellular carcinoma), chemotherapy, radiation and
myeloproliferative diseases. Formation of membranous
webs, probably congenital or as a consequence of organised
thrombosis, in the suprahepatic portion of inferior vena cava
is another important cause.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the liver is enlar-
ged, swollen, red-purple and has a tense capsule.
Histologically, the changes in sudden hepatic vein
occlusion are those of centrilobular congestion, necrosis
and rupture of sinusoids into the space of Disse. In slowly
developing thrombosis, the changes are more chronic and
include fibrosing reaction in the centrilobular zone that
may progress to cardiac cirrhosis.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Budd-Chiari syndrome is clinically
characterised by either an acute form or chronic form
depending upon the speed of occlusion.
In the acute form, the features are abdominal pain,
vomiting, enlarged liver, ascites and mild icterus.
In the more usual chronic form, the patients present with
pain over enlarged tender liver, ascites and other features of
portal hypertension.
The acute form of illness leads to acute hepatic failure
and death, whereas in chronic form the patient may live for
months to a few years.
Hepatic Veno-occlusive Disease
Hepatic veno-occlusive disease consists of intimal thickening,
stenosis and obliteration of the terminal central veins and
medium-sized hepatic veins. The venous occlusion results
in pathologic changes similar to those of Budd-Chiari
syndrome and can be distinguished from the latter by
demonstration of absence of thrombosis in the major hepatic
veins.
The cause and stimulus for hepatic veno-occlusive
disease are obscure. The condition is more widespread in
countries such as Africa, India and certain other tropical
countries where ‘bush tea’ (medicinal tea) is consumed that
contains hepatotoxic alkaloids. The disease has also been
found in association with administration of antineoplastic
drugs and immunosuppressive therapy.
II. PORTAL VENOUS OBSTRUCTION
Obstruction of the portal vein may occur within the
intrahepatic course or in extrahepatic site.
Intrahepatic cause of portal venous occlusion is hepatic
cirrhosis as the commonest and most important, followed in
decreasing frequency by tumour invasion, congenital hepatic
fibrosis and schistosomiasis.
Extrahepatic causes of portal vein obstruction are intra-
abdominal cancers, intra-abdominal sepsis, direct invasion
by tumour, myeloproliferative disorders and upper
abdominal surgical procedure followed by thrombosis.
The effects of portal venous obstruction depend upon
the site of obstruction. The most important effect, irrespective
of the site of occlusion or cause, is portal hypertension and
its manifestations (page 630). If the obstruction is in the
extrahepatic portal vein along with extension of occlusion
into splenic vein, it may result in venous infarction of the
bowel. Pylephlebitis may be followed by multiple pyaemic
liver abscesses.
Peliosis Hepatis
Although sinusoidal dilatation can occur secondary to many
liver diseases, peliosis hepatis is an uncommon condition of
primary sinusoidal dilatation that results in blockage of blood
outflow and may result in massive intraperitoneal
haemorrhage. Although exact etiology is not known, peliosis
hepatis and another related condition, bacillary angiomatosis
(page 413), have been found to occur in HIV-infected patients
whose CD4+ T cell counts fall below 100/μl.  Opportunistic
infection with Bartonella henselae in poor hygienic conditions
in these cases results in blood-filled cysts in liver partly lined
by endothelial cells and having mixed inflammatory cells in
a fibromyxoid background.
Etiologic association of peliosis hepatis with consumption
of anabolic steroids and oral contraceptives has also been
suggested and is self-limiting with withdrawal of the
offending agent.
III. HEPATIC ARTERIAL OBSTRUCTION
Diseases from obstruction of the hepatic artery are
uncommon. Rarely, accidental ligation of the main hepatic
artery or its branch to right lobe may be followed by fatal
infarction. Obstruction of the small intrahepatic arterial
branches usually does not produce any effects because of
good collateral circulation.
LIVER CELL NECROSIS
All forms of injury to the liver such as microbiologic, toxic,
circulatory or traumatic, result in necrosis of liver cells. The
extent of involvement of hepatic lobule in necrosis varies.
Accordingly, liver cell necrosis is divided into 3 types: diffuse
(submassive to massive), zonal and focal.
1.
DIFFUSE (SUBMASSIVE TO MASSIVE) NECROSIS.
When there is extensive and diffuse necrosis of the liver
involving all the cells in groups of lobules, it is termed
diffuse, or submassive to massive necrosis. It is most
commonly caused by viral hepatitis or drug toxicity.
2.
ZONAL NECROSIS. Zonal necrosis is necrosis of
hepatocytes in 3 different zones of the hepatic lobule (page
592). Accordingly, it is of 3 types; each type affecting
respective zone is caused by different etiologic factors:
i)
Centrilobular necrosis is the commonest type involving
hepatocytes in zone 3 (i.e. located around the central vein).
Centrilobular necrosis is characteristic feature of ischaemic
injury such as in shock and CHF since zone 3 is farthest from
the blood supply. Besides, it also occurs in poisoning with
chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and certain drugs.

CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
ii) Midzonal necrosis is uncommon and involves zone 2 of
the hepatic lobule. This pattern of necrosis is seen in yellow
fever and viral hepatitis. In viral hepatitis, some of the
necrosed hepatocytes of the mid-zone are transformed into
acidophilic, rounded Councilman bodies.
iii) Periportal (peripheral) necrosis is seen in zone 1
involving the parenchyma closest to the arterial and portal
blood supply. Since zone 1 is most well perfused, it is most
vulnerable to the effects of circulating hepatotoxins e.g. in
phosphorus poisoning and eclampsia.
3.
FOCAL NECROSIS. This form of necrosis involves small
groups of hepatocytes irregularly distributed in the hepatic
lobule. Focal necrosis is most often caused by microbiologic
infections. These include viral hepatitis, miliary tuberculosis,
typhoid fever and various other forms of bacterial, viral and
fungal infections. Focal necrosis may also occur in drug-
induced hepatitis.
VIRAL HEPATITIS
The term viral hepatitis is used to describe infection of the
liver caused by hepatotropic viruses. Currently there are 5
main varieties of these viruses and a sixth poorly-
characterised virus, causing distinct types of viral hepatitis:
Hepatitis A virus (HAV), causing a faecally-spread self-
limiting disease.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV), causing a parenterally transmitted
disease that may become chronic.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV), previously termed non-A, non-B
(NANB) hepatitis virus involved chiefly in transfusion-
related hepatitis.
Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) which is sometimes associated
as superinfection with hepatitis B infection.
Hepatitis E virus (HEV), causing water-borne infection.
Hepatitis G virus (HGV), is a recently discovered
transfusion-transmitted hepatotropic virus but is not known
to cause hepatitis.
All these human hepatitis viruses are RNA viruses except
HBV which is a DNA virus.
Though a number of other viral diseases such as infection
with Epstein-Barr virus (in infectious mononucleosis),
arbovirus (in yellow fever), cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex
and several others affect the liver but the changes produced
by them are nonspecific; the term ‘viral hepatitis’ is strictly
applied to infection of the liver by the hepatitis viruses.
ETIOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION
Based on the etiologic agent, viral hepatitis is currently
classified into 6 etiologic types—hepatitis A, hepatitis B,
hepatitis C, hepatitis D, hepatitis E and hepatitis G. The
contrasting features of major types are presented in
Table 21.6.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Hepatitis A
Infection with HAV causes hepatitis A (infectious hepatitis).
Hepatitis A is responsible for 20-25% of clinical hepatitis in
the developing countries of the world but the incidence is
much lower in the developed countries. Hepatitis A is
usually a benign, self-limiting disease and has an incubation
period of 15-45 days. The disease occurs in epidemic form
as well as sporadically. It is usually spread by faeco-oral
route. Parenteral transmission is extremely rare. The spread
is related to close personal contact such as in overcrowding,
poor hygiene and poor sanitation. Most frequently affected
age is 5-14 years; adults are often infected by spread from
children.
HEPATITIS A VIRUS (HAV). The etiologic agent for
hepatitis A, HAV, is a small, 27 nm diameter, icosahedral
non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus. Viral genome
has been characterised but only a single serotype has been
identified. HAV infection can be transmitted to primates and
the virus can be cultivated in vitro. Inactivation of viral
activity can be achieved by boiling for 1 minute, by ultraviolet
radiation, or by contact with formaldehyde and chlorine. The
virus is present in the liver cells, bile, stool and blood during
the incubation period and in pre-icteric phase but viral
shedding diminishes after the onset of jaundice. Chronic
carriers have not been identified for HAV infection.
PATHOGENESIS. The mechanism by which HAV infection
causes hepatitis A is poorly understood. An immunologic
basis is suspected but the evidence in support is indirect in
the form of immunologic markers but not direct demons-
tration of the etiologic agent in the affected hepatocytes.
These markers are as follows (Fig. 21.6):
1.
IgM anti-HAV antibody appears in the serum at the onset
of symptoms of acute hepatitis A.
2.
IgG anti-HAV antibody is detected in the serum after acute
illness and remains detectable indefinitely. It gives life-long
protective immunity against reinfection with HAV.
Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B (serum hepatitis) caused by HBV infection has a
longer incubation period (30-180 days) and is transmitted
parenterally such as in recipients of blood and blood
products, intravenous drug addicts, patients treated by renal
dialysis and hospital workers exposed to blood, and by
intimate physical contact such as from mother to child and
by sexual contact. The disease may occur at any age. HBV
infection causes more severe form of illness that includes:
acute hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis, progression to cirrhosis,
fulminant hepatitis and an asymptomatic carrier stage. HBV
plays some role in the development of hepatocellular
carcinoma as discussed later (page 634).
HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV). The etiologic agent for
hepatitis B, HBV, is a DNA virus which has been extensively
studied. Electron microscopic studies on serum of patients
infected with HBV show 3 forms of viral particles of 2 sizes:
small (spheres and tubules/filaments) and large (spheres)
as under:
i) Small particles are most numerous and exist in two forms—
as 22 nm spheres, and as tubules 22 nm in diameter and
100 nm long. These are antigenically identical to envelope
protein of HBV and represent excess of viral envelope protein
referred as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).
ii) Large particles, 42 nm in diameter, are double-shelled
spherical particles, also called as  Dane particles. These are
about 100 to 1000 times less in number in serum compared
to small 22 nm particles and represent intact virion of HBV.
The genomic structure of HBV is quite compact and
complex. The HBV DNA consists of 4 overlapping genes
which encode for multiple proteins (Fig 21.7):
1. S gene codes for the surface envelope protein, hepatitis B
surface antigen (HBsAg); this protein product is termed major
protein. HBsAg is present on the outer surface of the large
spherical particles as well as in small spherical and tubular
structures. Pre-S1 and pre-S2 regions of genome are upstream
of S gene and code for pre-S gene protein products that
includes receptor on the HBV surface and for hepatocyte
membrane proteins. The protein product of S-gene plus

607
CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
adjacent pre-S2 region is the middle protein, while the protein
products of pre-S1 plus pre-S2 regions is the large protein.
Large protein coming from both pre-S proteins is rich in
complete virions.
2. P gene is the largest and codes for DNA polymerase.
3. C gene codes for two nucleocapsid proteins, HBeAg and a
core protein termed HBcAg.
4. X gene codes for HBxAg which is a small non-particulate
protein. HbxAg has a role in transactivation the transcription
of both viral and cellular genes. The processes transactivated
by X-genes include signal-transduction pathways, increased
replication of HBV DNA, replication of other viruses
including HIV, enhanced susceptibility of HBV-infected
hepatocytes to cytolytic T cells, and pro-apoptotic pathway.
Expression of HbxAg and its antibodies associated with
enhanced HBV DNA replication has been implicated in
hepatocelluar carcinoma in patients of chronic hepatitis.
PATHOGENESIS. The evidence linking immuno-
pathogenetic mechanism with hepatocellular damage is
much stronger in HBV infection than with HAV infection.
In support of immune pathogenesis is the demonstration of
several immunological markers (serologic as well as viral),
and molecular and morphologic evidence that hepatocytic
damage is initiated by virus-infected CD8+T cytotoxic cells.
Serologic and viral markers. Various immunological markers
indicative of presence of HBV infection can be demonstrated
in the sera as well as in the hepatocytes of infected
individuals. These are as under (Fig. 21.8):
1.
HBsAg. In 1965, Blumberg and colleagues in Philadelphia
found a lipoprotein complex in the serum of a multiple-
transfused haemophiliac of Australian aborigine which was
subsequently shown by them to be associated with serum
hepatitis. This antigen was termed Australia antigen by them
(In 1977, Blumberg was awarded the Nobel prize for his
discovery). The term Australia antigen is now used
synonymous with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).
HBsAg appears early in the blood after about 6 weeks of
infection and its detection is an indicator of active HBV
infection. It usually disappears in 3-6 months. Its persistence
for more than 6 months implies a carrier state. HBsAg may
also be demonstrated in the cell membrane of hepatocytes
of carriers and chronic hepatitis patients by Orcein staining
(orange positivity) but not in the hepatocytes during acute
stage of illness.
2.
Anti-HBs. Specific antibody to HBsAg in serum called
anti-HBs appears late, about 3 months after the onset. Anti-
HBs response may be both IgM and IgG type. The prevalence
rate of anti-HBs ranges from 10-15%. In these individuals it
persists for life providing protection against reinfection with
HBV.
3.
HBeAg. HBeAg derived from core protein is present
transiently (3-6 weeks) during an acute attack. Its persistence
beyond 10 weeks is indicative of development of chronic liver
disease and carrier state.
4.
Anti-HBe. Antibody to HBeAg called anti-HBe appears
after disappearance of HBeAg. Seroconversion from HBeAg
to anti-HBe during acute stage of illness is a prognostic sign
for resolution of infection.
5.
HBcAg. HBcAg derived from core protein cannot be
detected in the blood. But HBcAg can be demonstrated in
the nuclei of hepatocytes in carrier state and in chronic
hepatitis patients by Orcein staining but not in the liver cells
during acute stage.
6.
Anti-HBc. Antibody to HBcAg called anti-HBc can,
however, be detected in the serum of acute hepatitis B
patients during pre-icteric stage. Anti-HBc may be IgM or
IgG class antibody. IgM anti-HBc persists for 4-6 months and
is followed later by IgG anti-HBc. Thus detection of high titre
of IgM anti-HBc is indicative of recent acute HBV infection,
while elevated level of IgG anti-HBc suggests HBV infection
in the remote past.
7.
HBV-DNA. Detection of HBV-DNA by molecular
hybridisation using the Southern blot technique is the most
sensitive index of hepatitis B infection. It is present in pre-
symptomatic phase and transiently during early acute stage.
Hepatitis D
Infection with delta virus (HDV) in the hepatocyte nuclei of
HBsAg-positive patients is termed hepatitis D. HDV is a
defective virus for which HBV is the helper. Thus, hepatitis
D develops when there is concomitant hepatitis B infection.
HDV infection and hepatitis B may be simultaneous (co-
infection), or HDV may infect a chronic HBsAg carrier
(superinfection) (Fig. 21.9):
With coinfection, acute hepatitis D may range from mild
to fulminant hepatitis but fulminant hepatitis is more likely
in such simultaneous delta infection. Chronicity rarely
develops in coinfection.
With superinfection (incubation period 30-35 days),
chronic HBV infection gets worsened indicated by
appearance of severe and fulminant acute attacks,
progression of carrier stage to chronic delta hepatitis or
acceleration towards cirrhosis. Occurrence of hepatocellular
carcinoma is, however, less common in HBsAg carriers with
HDV infection.
Figure 21.8
Sequence of serologic and viral markers in acute
hepatitis B.

608
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
HDV infection is worldwide in distribution though the
incidence may vary in different countries. Endemic regions
are Southern Europe, Middle-East, South India and parts of
Africa. The high-risk individuals for HDV infection are the
same as for HBV infection i.e. intravenous drug abusers,
homosexuals, transfusion recipients, and health care
workers.
HEPATITIS DELTA VIRUS (HDV). The etiologic agent,
HDV, is a small single-stranded RNA particle with a
diameter of 36 nm. It is double-shelled—the outer shell
consists of HBsAg and the inner shell consists of delta antigen
provided by a circular RNA strand. It is highly infectious
and can induce hepatitis in any HBsAg-positive host. HDV
replication and proliferation takes place within the nuclei of
liver cells. Markers for HDV infection include the following:
1.
HDV identification in the blood and in the liver cell nuclei.
2.
HDAg detectable in the blood and on fixed liver tissue
specimens.
3.
Anti-HD antibody in acute hepatitis which is initially IgM
type and later replaced by IgG type anti-HD antibody which
persists for life to confer immunity against reinfection.
PATHOGENESIS. HDV, unlike HBV, is thought to cause
direct cytopathic effect on hepatocytes. However, there are
examples of transmission of HDV infection from individuals
who themselves have not suffered from any attack of
hepatitis, suggesting that it may not be always cytopathic.
Thus, the exact mechanism remains unresolved.
Hepatitis C
The diagnosis of a third major category of hepatitis was
earlier made after exclusion of infection with other known
hepatitis viruses and was initially designated non-A, non-B
(NANB) hepatitis. However, now this third type has been
characterised and is called hepatitis C.
Hepatitis C infection is acquired by blood transfusions,
blood products, haemodialysis, parenteral drug abuse and
accidental cuts and needle-pricks in health workers. About
90% of post-transfusion hepatitis is of hepatitis C type. About
1-2% of volunteer blood donors and up to 5% of professional
blood donors are carriers of HCV. Hepatitis C has an
incubation period of 20-90 days (mean 50 days). Clinically,
acute HCV hepatitis is milder than HBV hepatitis but HCV
has a higher rate of progression to chronic hepatitis than
HBV. Persistence of infection and chronic hepatitis are the
key features of HCV. Occurrence of cirrhosis after 5 to 10
years and progression to hepatocellular carcinoma are other
late consequences of HCV infection. Currently, HCV is
considered more important cause of chronic liver disease
worldwide than HBV.
HEPATITIS C VIRUS (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded,
enveloped RNA virus, having a diameter of 30-60 nm. HCV
genome has about 3000 amino acids. The genomic
organisation of HCV shows a 5’ terminal end, C (capsid)
region  and the envelope regions E1 and E2 in the exons
(Fig. 21.10).
The viral proteins result in corresponding serologic and
virologic markers for HCV infection as under (Fig. 21.11):
1.
Anti-HCV antibodies. Three generations of anti-HCV IgG
assays are available:
i)
First generation antibodies are against C100-3 region
proteins and appear 1 to 3 months after infection.
Figure 21.9
Consequences of coinfection versus superinfection in combined HDV-HBV infection.
Figure 21.10
Diagrammatic structure of hepatitis C virus.

609
CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
ii) Second generation antibodies are against C200 and C33c
proteins and appear about one month earlier than the
first generation.
iii) Third generation antibodies are against C22-3 and NS-5
region proteins and are detected even earlier.
2.
HCV-RNA. HCV infection is, however, confirmed by
HCV-RNA employing PCR technique which can be detected
within a few days after exposure to HCV infection, much
before appearance of anti-HCV and persists for the duration
of HCV infection.
PATHOGENESIS. Cell-mediated immune mechanism and
production of antiviral cytokines by T-lymphocytes certainly
play a role in hepatocytic injury due to HCV. HCV virions
have not been identified in hepatocytes. Perhaps, HCV
infection of lymphoid cells may induce immunologic injury
to hepatocytes. In patients with chronic HCV hepatitis, HCV-
specific CD4+ T cells and HLA-restricted CD8+ T cells have
been identified. Crossreactivity between viral antigens and
host autoantibodies to liver-kidney microsomal antigen (anti-
LKM) have been reported in a subset of patients that explains
the association of autoimmune hepatitis and HCV hepatitis.
Hepatitis E
Hepatitis E is an enterically-transmitted virus, previously
labelled as epidemic or enterically transmitted variant of non-
A non-B hepatitis. The infection occurs in young or middle-
aged individuals, primarily seen in India, other Asian
countries, Africa and central America.
The infection is generally acquired by contamination of
water supplies such as after monsoon flooding. However,
compared with HAV, secondary person-to-person infection
does not occur with HEV. Thus HEV has some common
epidemiologic features with HAV. HEV infection has a
particularly high mortality in pregnant women but is
otherwise a self-limited disease and has not been associated
with chronic liver disease.
HEPATITIS E VIRUS (HEV). HEV is a single-stranded 32-
34 nm, icosahedral non-enveloped virus. The virus has been
isolated from stools, bile and liver of infected persons.
Serologic markers for HEV include the following:
1.
Anti-HEV antibodies of both IgM and IgG class.
2.
HEV-RNA.
However, testing for these markers for HEV is currently
not available.
Hepatitis G
A virus distinct from the foregoing hepatitis viruses has been
designated separately as hepatitis G (HGV). HGV infection
has been found in blood donors, patients on haemodialysis
and as coinfection with HIV. However, unlike HCV, HGV is
cleared from the plasma in majority of individuals while a
small percentage of cases have chronic HGV infection who
do not develop hepatitis, nor does infected blood require
screening for HGV RNA.
HEPATITIS G VIRUS (HGV). HGV is a single-stranded
RNA virus. The virus has been identified by PCR ampli-
fication technique.
CLINICOPATHOLOGIC SPECTRUM
Among the various etiologic types of hepatitis, evidence
linking HBV and HCV infection with the spectrum of clinico-
pathologic changes is stronger than with other hepatotropic
viruses. The typical pathologic changes of hepatitis by major
hepatotropic viruses are virtually similar. HAV and HEV,
however, do not have a carrier stage nor cause chronic
hepatitis. The various clinical patterns and pathologic
consequences of different hepatotropic viruses can be
considered under the following headings:
i)
Carrier state
ii) Asymptomatic infection
iii) Acute hepatitis
iv) Chronic hepatitis
v) Fulminant hepatitis (Submassive to massive necrosis)
In addition, progression to cirrhosis (page 624) and
association with hepatocellular carcinoma (page 634) are
known to occur in certain types of hepatitis which are
discussed separately later.
I.
Carrier State
An asymptomatic individual without manifest disease,
harbouring infection with hepatotropic virus and capable of
transmitting it is called carrier state. There can be 2 types of
carriers:
1.
An ‘asymptomatic healthy carrier’ who does not suffer from
ill-effects of the virus infection but is capable of transmitting.
2.
An ‘asymptomatic carrier with chronic disease’ capable of
transmitting the organisms.
As stated before, hepatitis A and E do not produce the
carrier state. Hepatitis B is responsible for the largest number
of carriers in the world, while concomitant infection with
HDV more often causes progressive disease rather than an
asymptomatic carrier state. There is geographic variation in
incidence of HBV carrier state: while in normal population
in US and western Europe it is less than 0.5%, its prevalence
Figure 21.11
Sequence of serologic and viral markers of HCV
infection.

610
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
is much higher in Asian and tropical countries (5-20%). An
estimated 2-3% of the general population are asymptomatic
carriers of HCV. Data on HBV carrier state reveal role of 2
important factors rendering the individual more vulnerable
to harbour the organisms—early age at infection and impaired
immunity. Whereas approximately 10% of adults contracting
hepatitis B infection develop carrier state, 90% of infected
neonates fail to clear HBsAg from the serum within 6 months
and become HBV carriers.
Clinical recognition of carrier state of HBV is more
frequently done by detection of HBsAg in the serum and less
often by other markers such as HBeAg, HBcAg and
antibodies. Concomitant infection of HDV with HBV
depends upon the demonstration of anti-HD.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Carriers of HBV may or
may not show changes on liver biopsy.
Healthy HBV carriers may show no changes or minor
hepatic change such as presence of finely granular,
ground-glass, eosinophilic cytoplasm as evidence of
HBsAg.
Asymptomatic carriers with chronic disease may show
changes of chronic hepatitis and even cirrhosis.
II. Asymptomatic Infection
These are cases who are detected incidentally to have
infection with one of the hepatitis viruses as revealed by their
raised serum transaminases or by detection of the presence
of antibodies but are otherwise asymptomatic.
III. Acute Hepatitis
The most common consequence of all hepatotropic viruses
is acute inflammatory involvement of the entire liver. In
general, type A, B, C, D and E run similar clinical course
and show identical pathologic findings.
Clinically, acute hepatitis is categorised into 4 phases:
incubation period, pre-icteric phase, icteric phase and post-
icteric phase.
1.
Incubation period: It varies among different hepatotropic
viruses: for hepatitis A it is about 4 weeks (15-45 days); for
hepatitis B the average is 10 weeks (30-180 days); for hepatitis
D about 6 weeks (30-50 days); for hepatitis C the mean
incubation period is about 7 weeks (20-90 days), and for
hepatitis E it is 2-8 weeks (15-60 days). The patient remains
asymptomatic during incubation period but the infectivity
is highest during the last days of incubation period.
2.
Pre-icteric phase: This phase is marked by prodromal
constitutional symptoms that include anorexia, nausea,
vomiting, fatigue, malaise, distaste for smoking, arthralgia
and headache. There may be low-grade fever preceding the
onset of jaundice, especially in hepatitis A. The earliest
laboratory evidence of hepatocellular injury in pre-icteric
phase is the elevation of transaminases.
3.
Icteric phase: The prodromal period is heralded by the
onset of clinical jaundice and the constitutional symptoms
diminish. Other features include dark-coloured urine due to
bilirubinuria, clay-coloured stools due to cholestasis, pruritus
as a result of elevated serum bile acids, loss of weight and
abdominal discomfort due to enlarged, tender liver. The
diagnosis is based on deranged liver function tests (e.g.
elevated levels of serum bilirubin, transaminases and
alkaline phosphatase; prolonged prothrombin time and
hyperglobulinaemia) and serologic detection of hepatitis
antigens and antibodies.
4.
Post-icteric phase: The icteric phase lasting for about 1
to 4 weeks is usually followed by clinical and biochemical
recovery in 2 to 12 weeks. The recovery phase is more
prolonged in hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Up to 1% cases of
acute hepatitis may develop severe form of the disease
(fulminant hepatitis); and 5-10% of cases progress on to
chronic hepatitis. Evolution into the carrier state (except in
HAV and HEV infection) has already been described above.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the liver is
slightly enlarged, soft and greenish.
Histologically, the changes are as follows (Fig. 21.12):
Figure 21.12
Acute viral hepatitis. The predominant histologic changes are: variable degree of necrosis of hepatocytes, most marked in zone
3 (centrilobular); and mononuclear cellular infiltrate in the lobule. Mild degree of liver cell necrosis is seen as ballooning degeneration while
acidophilic Councilman bodies (inbox) are indicative of more severe liver cell injury.

611
CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
1.
Hepatocellular injury: There may be variation in the
degree of liver cell injury but it is most marked in zone 3
(centrilobular zone):
i)
Mildly injured hepatocytes appear swollen with
granular cytoplasm which tends to condense around the
nucleus (ballooning degeneration).
ii) Others show acidophilic degeneration in which the
cytoplasm becomes intensely eosinophilic, the nucleus
becomes small and pyknotic and is eventually extruded
from the cell, leaving behind necrotic, acidophilic mass
called Councilman body or acidophil body by the process
known as apoptosis.
iii) Another type of hepatocellular necrosis is dropout
necrosis in which isolated or small clusters of hepatocytes
undergo lysis.
iv) Bridging necrosis is a more severe form of hepato-
cellular injury in acute viral hepatitis and may progress
to fulminant hepatitis or chronic hepatitis (discussed
below). Bridging necrosis is characterised by bands of
necrosis linking portal tracts to central hepatic veins, one
central hepatic vein to another, or a portal tract to another
tract.
2.
Inflammatory infiltrate: There is infiltration by
mononuclear inflammatory cells, usually in the portal
tracts, but may permeate into the lobules.
3.
Kupffer cell hyperplasia: There is reactive hyper-
plasia of Kupffer cells many of which contain phago-
cytosed cellular debris, bile pigment and lipofuscin
granules.
4.
Cholestasis: Biliary stasis is usually not severe in viral
hepatitis and may be present as intracytoplasmic bile
pigment granules.
5.
Regeneration: As a result of necrosis of hepatocytes,
there is lobular disarray. Surviving adjacent hepatocytes
undergo regeneration and hyperplasia. If the necrosis
causes collapse of reticulin framework of the lobule,
healing by fibrosis follows, distorting the lobular
architecture.
The above histologic changes apply to viral hepatitis by
various types of hepatotropic viruses in general, and by HBV
in particular. It is usually not possible to distinguish
histologically between viral hepatitis of various etiologies,
but the following morphologic features may help in giving
an etiologic clue:
HAV hepatitis is a panlobular involvement by heavy
inflammatory infiltrate compared to other types.
HCV hepatitis causes milder necrosis, with fatty change
in hepatocytes, presence of lymphoid aggregates in the portal
triads and degeneration of bile duct epithelium.
IV. Chronic Hepatitis
Chronic hepatitis is defined as continuing or relapsing
hepatic disease for more than 6 months with symptoms along
with biochemical, serologic and histopathologic evidence of
inflammation and necrosis. Majority of cases of chronic
hepatitis are the result of infection with hepatotropic
viruses—hepatitis B, hepatitis C and combined hepatitis B
and hepatitis D infection. However, some non-viral causes
of chronic hepatitis include: Wilson’s disease, α-1-antitrypsin
deficiency, chronic alcoholism, drug-induced injury and
autoimmune diseases. The last named gives rise to
autoimmune or lupoid hepatitis which is characterised by
positive serum autoantibodies (e.g. antinuclear, anti-smooth
muscle and anti-mitochondrial) and a positive LE cell test
but negative for serologic markers of viral hepatitis.
Until recent years, prediction of prognosis of chronic
hepatitis used to be made on the basis of morphology which
divided it into 2 main types—chronic persistent and chronic
active (aggressive) hepatitis. A third form, chronic lobular
hepatitis is distinguished separately by some as mild form of
lobular inflammation without inflammation of portal tracts
but these cases often recover completely. However,
subsequent studies have revealed that morphologic subtypes
do not necessarily correlate with prognosis since the disease
is not essentially static but may vary from mild form to severe
and vice versa. Besides, two other factors which determine
the vulnerability of a patient of viral hepatitis to develop
chronic hepatitis are: impaired immunity and extremes of age
at which the infection is first contracted. Currently, therefore,
chronic hepatitis is classified on the basis of etiology and
hepatitis activity score (described below). The frequency and
severity with which hepatotropic viruses cause chronic
hepatitis varies with the organisms as under:
HCV infection accounts for 40-60% cases of chronicity in
adults. HCV infection is particularly associated with
progressive form of chronic hepatitis  that may evolve into
cirrhosis.
HBV causes chronic hepatitis in 90% of infected infants
and in about 5% adult cases of hepatitis B.
HDV superinfection on HBV carrier state may be
responsible for chronic hepatitis in 10-40% cases.
HAV and HEV do not produce chronic hepatitis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The pathologic features
are common to both HBV and HCV infection and include
the following lesions (Fig. 21.13).
1.
Piecemeal necrosis. Piecemeal necrosis is defined as
periportal destruction of hepatocytes at the limiting plate
(piecemeal = piece by piece). Its features in chronic hepatitis
are as under:
i)
Necrosed hepatocytes at the limiting plate in
periportal zone.
ii) Interface hepatitis due to expanded portal tract by
infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells and
macrophages.
iii) Expanded portal tracts are often associated with
proliferating bile ductules as a response to liver cell injury.
2.
Portal tract lesions. All forms of chronic hepatitis are
characterised by variable degree of changes in the portal
tract.
i)
Inflammatory cell infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma
cells and macrophages (triaditis).
ii) Proliferated bile ductules in the expanded portal tracts.
iii) Additionally, chronic hepatitis C may show lymphoid
aggregates or follicles with reactive germinal centre and

612
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
infiltration of inflammatory cells in the damaged bile duct
epithelial cells.
3.
Intralobular lesions. Generally, the architecture of
lobule is retained in mild to moderate chronic hepatitis.
i)
There are focal areas of necrosis and inflammation
within the hepatic parenchyma.
ii) Scattered acidophilic bodies in the lobule.
iii) Kupffer cell hyperplasia.
iv) More severe form of injury shows bridging necrosis
(i.e. bands of necrosed hepatocytes that may bridge portal
tract-to-central vein, central vein-to-central vein, and
portal tract-to-portal tract).
v) Regenerative changes in hepatocytes in cases of
persistent hepatocellular necrosis.
vi) Cases of chronic hepatitis C show moderate fatty
change.
vii) Cases of chronic hepatitis B show scattered ground-
glass hepatocytes indicative of abundance of HBsAg in
the cytoplasm.
4.
Bridging fibrosis. The onset of fibrosis in chronic
hepatitis from the area of interface hepatitis and bridging
necrosis is a feature of irreversible damage.
i)
At first, there is periportal fibrosis at the sites of inter-
face hepatitis giving the portal tract stellate-shaped
appearance.
ii) Progressive cases show bridging fibrosis connecting
portal tract-to-portal tract or portal tract-to-central vein
traversing the lobule.
iii) End-stage of chronic hepatitis is characterised by dense
collagenous septa destroying lobular architecture and
forming nodules resulting in postnecrotic cirrhosis.
As prognostic indicator of chronic hepatitis, criteria have
been evolved to classify chronic hepatitis by giving hepatitis
activity score (ranging from none to minimal/mild to
moderate and severe) described by Knodell and Ishak based
on the following features:
A. Necroinflammatory activity:
Periportal necrosis i.e. piecemeal necrosis and/ or bridging
necrosis (ranging from score 0 as ‘no necrosis’ to score 4 as
‘multilobular necrosis’).
Intralobular necrosis, focal or confluent  (ranging from score
0 as ‘none’ to score 4 for ‘>10 foci’ for focal necrosis, and
score 6 as ‘panacinar/multiacinar’ for  confluent necrosis).
Chronic hepatitis. Diagrammatic representation of
pathologic changes in chronic hepatitis (B) contrasted with normal
morphology (A). Photomicrograph on right (C) shows stellate-shaped
portal triad, with extension of fibrous spurs into lobules. The portal tract
is expanded due to increased lymphomononuclear inflammatory cells
which are seen to breach the limiting plate (i.e. hepatocytes at the interface
of portal tract and lobule are destroyed).

CLINICAL FEATURES. The clinical features of chronic
hepatitis are quite variable ranging from mild disease to full-
blown picture of cirrhosis.
i)
Mild chronic hepatitis shows only slight but persistent
elevation of transaminases (‘transaminitis’) with fatigue,
malaise and loss of appetite.
ii) Other cases may show mild hepatomegaly, hepatic
tenderness and mild splenomegaly.
iii) Laboratory findings may reveal prolonged prothrombin
time, hyperbilirubinaemia, hyperglobulinaemia and
markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase.
iv) Systemic features of circulating immune complexes due
to HBV and HCV infection may produce features of immune
complex vasculitis, glomerulonephritis and cryoglobuli-
naemia in a proportion of cases.
However, clinical features do not correlate with morpho-
logic appearance of the liver biopsy. Some patients may have
mild form of disease without progressing for several years
while others may show rapid evolution into cirrhosis with
its complications over a period of few years. Patients of long-
standing HBV and HCV chronic infection are known to
evolve into hepatocellular carcinoma.
V. Fulminant Hepatitis
(Submassive to Massive Necrosis)
Fulminant hepatitis is the most severe form of acute hepatitis
in which there is rapidly progressive hepatocellular failure.
Two patterns are recognised—submassive necrosis having a
less rapid course extending up to 3 months; and massive
necrosis in which the liver failure is rapid and fulminant
occurring in 2-3 weeks.
Fulminant hepatitis of either of the two varieties can occur
from viral and non-viral etiologies:
Acute viral hepatitis accounts for about half the cases, most
often from HBV and HCV; less frequently from combined
HBV-HDV and rarely from HAV. However, HEV infection
is a serious complication in pregnant women. In addition,
herpesvirus can also cause serious viral hepatitis.
Non-viral causes include acute hepatitis due to drug
toxicity (e.g. acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, isoniazid, halothane and anti-
depressants), poisonings, hypoxic injury and massive
infiltration of malignant tumours into the liver.
The patients present with features of hepatic failure with
hepatic encephalopathy (page 602). The mortality rate is high
if hepatic transplantation is not undertaken.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the liver is small
and shrunken, often weighing 500-700 gm. The capsule
is loose and wrinkled. The sectioned surface shows diffuse
or random involvement of hepatic lobes. There are
extensive areas of muddy-red and yellow necrosis
(previously called acute yellow atrophy) and patches of
green bile staining.
Histologically, two forms of fulminant necrosis are
distinguished—submassive and massive necrosis
(Fig. 21.14).
i)
In submassive necrosis, large groups of hepatocytes
in zone 3 (centrilobular area) and zone 2 (mid zone) are
wiped out leading to a collapsed reticulin framework.
Regeneration in submassive necrosis is more orderly and
may result in restoration of normal architecture.
ii) In massive necrosis, the entire liver lobules are
necrotic. As a result of loss of hepatic parenchyma, all that
is left is the collapsed and condensed reticulin framework
and portal tracts with proliferated bile ductules plugged
Figure 21.14

by reticulin stain (right photomicrograph). There is no significant inflammation or fibrosis.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
with bile. Inflammatory infiltrate is scanty. Regeneration,
if it takes place, is disorderly forming irregular masses of
hepatocytes. Fibrosis is generally not a feature of
fulminant hepatitis.
The clinicopathologic course in two major forms of
hepatitis, HBV and HCV, is summarised in Fig. 21.15.
IMMUNOPROPHYLAXIS AND HEPATITIS VACCINES
Best prophylaxis against the viral hepatitis remains
prevention of its spread to the contacts after detection and
identification of route by which infection is acquired such as
from food or water contamination, sexual spread or
parenteral spread. Of late, however, immunoprophylaxis and
a few hepatitis vaccines have been developed and some more
are under development. The principle underlying either of
these two forms of prophylaxis is that the persons who
develop good antibody response to the antigen of the
hepatotropic virus following active infection are protected
against the disease on reinfection. Thus, pre-testing of
persons may be carried out so as to determine their antibody
level. Immunoprophylaxis and hepatitis vaccination are
unnecessary if the pre-testing for antibodies is positive.
1.
Hepatitis A. Passive immunisation with immune
globulin as well as active immunisation with a killed vaccine
are available.
2.
Hepatitis B. Earlier, only passive immunoprophylaxis
with standard immune globulin was used. Later, active
immunisation against HBsAg was introduced. Current
recommendations include pre-exposure and post-exposure
prophylaxis with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine:
Pre-exposure prophylaxis is done for individuals at high-
risk e.g. health care workers, haemodialysis patients and
staff, haemophiliacs, intravenous drug users etc. Three
intramuscular injections of hepatitis vaccine at 0, 1 and 6
months are recommended.
Post-exposure prophylaxis is carried out for unvaccinated
persons exposed to HBV infection and includes prophylaxis
with combination of hepatitis B immune globulin and
hepatitis B vaccine.
3.
Hepatitis D. Hepatitis D infection can also be prevented
by hepatitis B vaccine.
4.
Hepatitis C. Currently, hepatitis C vaccine has yet not
been feasible though antibodies to HCV envelope have been
developed.
5.
Hepatitis E. It is not certain whether immune globulin
(like for HAV) prevents hepatitis E infection or not but a
vaccine against HEV is yet to be developed.
OTHER INFECTIONS AND INFESTATIONS
Apart from viral hepatitis, the liver is affected by infections
with bacteria, spirochaetes and fungi and is involved in some
parasitic infestations. Some common examples of such
conditions are described below.
CHOLANGITIS
Cholangitis is the term used to describe inflammation of the
extrahepatic or intrahepatic bile ducts, or both. There are two
main types of cholangitis—pyogenic and primary sclerosing.
While primary sclerosing cholangitis is discussed later with
biliary cirrhosis (page 625), pyogenic cholangitis is described
below.
Pyogenic Cholangitis
Cholangitis occurring secondary to obstruction of a major
extrahepatic duct causes pyogenic cholangitis. Most
commonly, the obstruction is from impacted gallstone; other
causes are carcinoma arising in the extrahepatic ducts,
carcinoma head of pancreas, acute pancreatitis and
inflammatory strictures in the bile duct. Bacteria gain entry
to the obstructed duct and proliferate in the bile. Infection
spreads along the branches of obstructed duct and reaches
the liver, termed ascending cholangitis. The common infecting
bacteria are enteric organisms such as E.coli, Klebsiella and
Enterobacter.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The affected ducts show
small beaded abscesses accompanied by bile stasis along
their course and larger abscesses within the liver. The
abscesses are composed of acute inflammatory cells which
in time are replaced by chronic inflammatory cells and
enclosed by fibrous capsule.
PYOGENIC LIVER ABSCESS
Most liver abscesses are of bacterial (pyogenic) origin; less
often they are amoebic, hydatid and rarely actinomycotic.
Pyogenic liver abscesses have become uncommon due to
improved diagnostic facilities and the early use of antibiotics.
However, their incidence is higher in old age and in
immunosuppressed patients such as in AIDS, transplant
recipients and those on intensive chemotherapy.
Pyogenic liver abscesses are classified on the basis of the
mode of entry as under:
1.
Ascending cholangitis through ascending infection in the
biliary tract due to obstruction e.g. gallstones, cancer,
sclerosing cholangitis and biliary strictures.
Figure 21.15
Clinicopathologic course of HBV and HCV infection.

615
CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
2.
Portal pyaemia by means of spread of pelvic or gastro-
intestinal infection resulting in portal pylephlebitis or septic
emboli e.g. from appendicitis, empyema of gallbladder,
diverticulitis, regional enteritis, pancreatitis, infected
haemorrhoids and neonatal umbilical vein sepsis.
3.
Septicaemia through spread by hepatic artery.
4.
Direct infection resulting in solitary liver abscess e.g. from
adjacent perinephric abscess, secondary infection in amoebic
liver abscess, metastasis and formation of haematoma
following trauma.
5.
Iatrogenic causes include liver biopsy, percutaneous biliary
drainage and accidental surgical trauma.
6.
Cryptogenic from unknown causes, especially in the
elderly.
The commonest infecting organisms are gram-negative
bacteria chiefly E. coli; others are Pseudomonas, Klebsiella,
Enterobacter and a number of anaerobic organisms,
bacteroides and actinomyces.
Liver abscesses are clinically characterised by pain in the
right upper quadrant, fever, tender hepatomegaly and
sometimes jaundice. Laboratory examination reveals
leucocytosis, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase,
hypoalbuminaemia and a positive blood culture.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly depending upon
the cause for pyogenic liver abscess, they occur as single
or multiple yellow abscesses, 1 cm or more in diameter,
in an enlarged liver. A single abscess generally has a thick
fibrous capsule. The abscesses are particularly common
in right lobe of the liver (Fig. 21.16).
Microscopically, typical features of abscess are seen.
There are multiple small neutrophilic abscesses with areas
of extensive necrosis of the affected liver parenchyma. The
adjacent viable area shows pus and blood clots in the
portal vein, inflammation, congestion and proliferating
fibroblasts. Direct extension from the liver may lead to
subphrenic or pleuro-pulmonary suppuration or
peritonitis. There may be small pyaemic abscesses
elsewhere such as in the lungs, kidneys, brain and spleen.
AMOEBIC LIVER ABSCESS
Amoebic liver abscesses are less common than pyogenic liver
abscesses and have many similar features. They are caused
by the spread of Entamoeba histolytica from intestinal lesions.
The trophozoite form of amoebae in the colon invade the
colonic mucosa forming flask-shaped ulcers from where they
are carried to the liver in the portal venous system (page
188) . Amoebae multiply and block small intrahepatic portal
radicles resulting in infarction necrosis of the adjacent liver
parenchyma.
The patients, generally from tropical and subtropical
countries, may give history of amoebic dysentery in the past.
Cysts of E. histolytica in stools are present in only 15% of
patients of hepatic amoebiasis. Intermittent low-grade fever,
pain and tenderness in the liver area are common presenting
features. A positive haemagglutination test is quite sensitive
and useful for diagnosis of amoebic liver abscess.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, amoebic liver
abscesses are usually solitary and more often located in
the right lobe in the posterosuperior portion. Amoebic
liver abscess may vary greatly in size but is generally of
the size of an orange. The centre of the abscess contains
large necrotic area having reddish-brown, thick pus
resembling anchovy or chocolate sauce. The abscess wall
consists of irregular shreds of necrotic liver tissue (Fig.
21.17).
Histologically, the necrotic area consists of degenerated
liver cells, leucocytes, red blood cells, strands of
connective tissue and debris. Amoebae are most easily
found in the liver tissue at the margin of abscess. PAS-
staining is employed to confirm the trophozoites of E.
histolytica.
HEPATIC TUBERCULOSIS
Tuberculosis of the liver occurs as a result of miliary
dissemination from primary complex or from chronic adult
pulmonary tuberculosis. The diagnosis is possible by liver
biopsy. The patients may have unexplained fever, jaundice,
hepatomegaly or hepatosplenomegaly. There may be
elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels and
hyperglobulinaemia.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The basic lesion is the
epithelioid cell granuloma characterised by central

caseation necrosis with destruction of the reticulin
framework and peripheral cuff of lymphocytes
(Fig. 21.18). Ziehl-Neelsen staining for AFB or culture of
the organism from the biopsy tissue is confirmatory. Rare
lesions consist of tuberculous cholangitis and tuberculous
pylephlebitis.
HYDATID DISEASE (ECHINOCOCCOSIS)
Hydatid disease occurs as a result of infection by the larval
cyst stage of the tapeworm, Echinococcus granulosus. The dog
is the common definite host, while man, sheep and cattle
are the intermediate hosts. The dog is infected by eating the
viscera of sheep containing hydatid cysts. The infected faeces
of the dog contaminate grass and farmland from where the
ova are ingested by sheep, pigs and man. Thus, man can
acquire infection by handling dogs as well as by eating conta-
minated vegetables. The ova ingested by man are liberated
from the chitinous wall by gastric juice and pass through
the intestinal mucosa from where they are carried to the liver
by portal venous system. These are trapped in the hepatic
sinusoids where they eventually develop into hydatid cyst.
About 70% of hydatid cysts develop in the liver which acts
as the first filter for ova. However, ova which pass through
the liver enter the right side of the heart and are caught in
the pulmonary capillary bed and form pulmonary hydatid
cysts. Some ova which enter the systemic circulation give
rise to hydatid cysts in the brain, spleen, bone and muscles.
The disease is common in sheep-raising countries such
as Australia, New Zealand and South America. The
uncomplicated hydatid cyst of the liver may be silent or may
produce dull ache in the liver area and some abdominal
distension.
Complications of hydatid cyst include its rupture (e.g. into
the peritoneal cavity, bile ducts and lungs), secondary
infection and hydatid allergy due to sensitisation of the host
with cyst fluid. The diagnosis is made by peripheral blood
eosinophilia, radiologic examination and serologic tests such
as indirect haemagglutination test and Casoni skin test.

whitish membrane resembling the membrane of a hard boiled egg.

617
CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Hydatid cyst grows
slowly and may eventually attain a size over 10 cm in
diameter in about 5 years. E. granulosus generally causes
unilocular hydatid cyst while E. multilocularis results in
multilocular or alveolar hydatid disease in the liver.
The cyst wall is composed of 3 distinguishable zones—
outer pericyst, intermediate characteristic ectocyst and inner
endocyst  (Fig. 21.19):
1.
Pericyst is the outer host inflammatory reaction
consisting of fibroblastic proliferation, mononuclear cells,
eosinophils and giant cells, eventually developing into
dense fibrous capsule which may even calcify.
2.
Ectocyst is the intermediate layer composed of
characteristic acellular, chitinous, laminated hyaline
material  (Fig. 21.20).
3.
Endocyst is the inner germinal layer bearing daughter
cysts (brood-capsules) and scolices projecting into the
lumen.
Hydatid sand is the grain-like material composed of
numerous scolices present in the hydatid fluid. Hydatid
fluid, in addition, contains antigenic proteins so that its
liberation into circulation gives rise to pronounced
eosinophilia or may cause anaphylaxis.
CHEMICAL AND DRUG INJURY
HEPATIC DRUG METABOLISM. The liver plays a central
role in the metabolism of a large number of organic and
inorganic chemicals and drugs which gain access to the body
by inhalation, injection, or most commonly, via the intestinal
tract. The main drug metabolising system resides in the
microsomal fraction of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum
of the liver cells via P-450 cytochrome and cytochrome
reductase enzyme systems. Other steps involved in the drug
metabolism are its conjugation with an endogenous mole-
cule, its active transport from the hepatocytes and ultimately
its excretion in the bile or in urine depending upon the
molecular weight of the substance. A number of risk factors
predispose an individual to hepatic drug injury such as pre-
existing liver disease, aging, female sex and genetic inability
to perform a particular biotransformation.
HEPATOTOXICITY. Toxic liver injury produced by drugs
and chemicals may virtually mimic any form of naturally-
occurring liver disease. In fact, any patient presenting with
liver disease or unexplained jaundice is thoroughly
questioned about history of drug intake or exposure to
chemicals. Hepatotoxicity from drugs and chemicals is the
commonest form of iatrogenic disease. Severity of
hepatotoxicity is greatly increased if the drug is continued
after symptoms develop.
Among the various inorganic compounds producing
hepatotoxicity are arsenic, phosphorus, copper and iron.
Organic agents include certain naturally-occurring plant
toxins such as pyrrolizidine alkaloids, mycotoxins and
bacterial toxins. The synthetic group of organic compounds
are a large number of medicinal agents. In addition, exposure
to hepatotoxic compounds may be occupational,
environmental or domestic that could be accidental,
homicidal or suicidal ingestion.
In general, drug reactions affecting the liver are divided
into two main classes:
1.
Direct or predictable, when the drug or one of its
metabolites is either directly toxic to the liver or it lowers
the host immune defense mechanism. The adverse effects
occur in most individuals who consume them and their
hepatotoxicity is dose-dependent e.g. carbon tetrachloride.
2.
Indirect or unpredictable or idiosyncratic, when the
drug or one of its metabolites acts as a hapten and induces
hypersensitivity in the host. In many instances, drug
hepatotoxicity is associated with appearance of
autoantibodies to liver-kidney microsomes (i.e. anti-LKM2)
directed against cytochrome P450 enzyme. The hepato-
toxicity by this group does not occur regularly in all
individuals and the effects are usually not dose-related e.g.
acetaminophen.

Microscopy shows three layers in the wall of hydatid cyst. Inbox in the right photomicrograph shows a scolex with a row of
hooklets.

618
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
A simplified clinicopathologic classification of important
hepatic drug reactions and the agents causing them is
presented in Table 21.7. The changes produced by
hepatotoxic agents may vary from mild, which are diagnosed
only by elevated serum transaminases, to instances of
massive necrosis and death. The pathologic changes by
hepatotoxins include 2 large categories:
1.
Acute liver disease characterised by cholestasis,
hepatocellular necrosis, fatty change, granulomatous reaction
or vascular disease.
2.
Chronic liver disease characterised by variable degree of
fibrosis, cirrhosis or neoplasia.
As such, the pathologic changes induced by hepatotoxins
are indistinguishable from the respective disease states.
CIRRHOSIS
Cirrhosis of the liver is one of the ten leading causes of death
in the Western world. It represents the irreversible end-stage
of several diffuse diseases causing hepatocellular injury and
is characterised by the following 4 features:
1.
It involves the entire liver.
2.
The normal lobular architecture of hepatic parenchyma
is disorganised.
3.
There is formation of nodules separated from one another
by irregular bands of fibrosis.
4.
It occurs following hepatocellular necrosis of varying
etiology so that there are alternate areas of necrosis and
regenerative nodules. However, regenerative nodules are not
essential for diagnosis of cirrhosis since biliary cirrhosis and
cirrhosis in haemochromatosis have little regeneration.
PATHOGENESIS
Irrespective of the etiology, cirrhosis in general is initiated
by hepatocellular necrosis. Continued destruction of
hepatocytes causes collapse of normal lobular hepatic
parenchyma followed by fibrosis around necrotic liver cells
and proliferated ductules and there is formation of
compensatory regenerative nodules.
FIBROGENESIS. Fibrosis in the liver lobules may be portal-
central, portal-portal, or both. The mechanism of fibrosis is
by increased synthesis of all types of collagen and increase
in the number of collagen-producing cells. In cirrhosis, there
is proliferation of fat-storing Ito cells underlying the
sinusoidal epithelium which become transformed into
myofibroblasts and fibrocytes. Besides collagen, two
glycoproteins, fibronectin and laminin, are deposited in
excessive amounts in area of liver cell damage. The nature
of factors acting as stimulants for fibrosis is not clearly
known, but possible candidate mediators are lymphokines
and monokines.
REGENERATIVE NODULE. The cause of compensatory
proliferation of hepatocytes to form regenerative nodules is
obscure. Possibly, growth factors, chalones and hormonal
imbalance, play a role in regeneration.
CLASSIFICATION
Cirrhosis can be classified on the basis of morphology and
etiology (Table 21.8).
A. MORPHOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION. There are 3
morphologic types of cirrhosis—micronodular, macro-
nodular and mixed. Each of these forms may have an active
and inactive form.
An active form is characterised by continuing hepato-
cellular necrosis and inflammatory reaction, a process that
closely resembles chronic hepatitis.
An inactive form, on the other hand, has no evidence of
continuing hepatocellular necrosis and has sharply-defined
nodules of surviving hepatic parenchyma without any
significant inflammation.
1.
Micronodular cirrhosis. In micronodular cirrhosis, the
nodules are usually regular and small, less than 3 mm in
diameter. There is diffuse involvement of all the hepatic
lobules forming nodules by thick fibrous septa which may

The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
be portal-portal, portal-central, or both. The micronodular
cirrhosis includes etiologic type of alcoholic cirrhosis (or
nutritional cirrhosis or Laennec’s cirrhosis) and represents
impaired capacity for regrowth as seen in alcoholism,
malnutrition, severe anaemia and old age.
2.
Macronodular cirrhosis. In this type, the nodules are of
variable size and are generally larger than 3 mm in diameter.
The pattern of involvement is more irregular than in
micronodular cirrhosis, sparing some portal tracts and
central veins, and more marked evidence of regeneration.
Macronodular cirrhosis corresponds to post-necrotic (or post-
hepatitis) cirrhosis of the etiologic classification.
3.
Mixed cirrhosis. In mixed type, some parts of the liver
show micronodular appearance while other parts show
macronodular pattern. All the portal tracts and central veins
are not involved by fibrosis but instead some of them are
spared. Mixed pattern is a kind of incomplete expression of
micronodular cirrhosis.
B. ETIOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION. Based on the etiologic
agent for cirrhosis, various categories of cirrhosis are
described as given in Table 21.8.
SPECIFIC TYPES OF CIRRHOSIS
Alcoholic Liver Disease and Cirrhosis
Alcoholic liver disease is the term used to describe the
spectrum of liver injury associated with acute and chronic
alcoholism. There are three sequential stages in alcoholic liver
disease: alcoholic steatosis (fatty liver), alcoholic hepatitis and
alcoholic cirrhosis.
Before discussing the features of alcoholic liver disease
and cirrhosis, a brief outline of ethanol metabolism is
outlined below and is discussed earlier in Chapter 9 (page
239).
ETHANOL METABOLISM. One gram of alcohol gives 7
calories. But alcohol cannot be stored in the body and must
undergo obligatory oxidation, chiefly in the liver. Thus, these
empty calories make no contribution to nutrition other than
to give energy.
Ethanol after ingestion and absorption from the small
bowel circulates through the liver where about 90% of it is
oxidised to acetate by a two-step enzymatic process involving
two enzymes: alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) present in the
cytosol, and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) in the
mitochondria of hepatocytes (Fig. 21.21). The remaining 10%
of ethanol is oxidised elsewhere in the body.
First step: Ethanol is catabolised to acetaldehyde in the liver
by the following three pathways, one major and two minor:
i)
In the cytosol, by the major rate-limiting pathway of
alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH).
ii) In the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, via microsomal P-450
oxidases (also called microsomal ethanol oxidising system,
MEOS), where only part of ethanol is metabolised.
iii) In the peroxisomes, minor pathway via catalase such as
H2O2.

dinucleotide; NADH = reduced NAD).

620
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Acetaldehyde is toxic and may cause membrane damage
and cell necrosis. Simultaneously, the cofactor nicotinamide-
adenine dinucleotide (NAD) which is a hydrogen acceptor,
is reduced to NADH.
Second step: The second step occurs in the mitochondria
where acetaldehyde is converted to acetate with ALDH
acting as a co-enzyme. Most of the acetate on leaving the
liver is finally oxidised to carbon dioxide and water, or
converted by the citric acid cycle to other compounds
including fatty acids. Simultaneously, the same cofactor,
NAD, is reduced to NADH resulting in increased NADH:
NAD redox ratio which is the basic biochemical alteration
occurring during ethanol metabolism. A close estimate of
NADH:NAD ratio is measured by the ratio of its oxidised
and reduced metabolites in the form of lactate-pyruvate ratio
and β-hydroxy butyrate-acetoacetate ratio.
RISK FACTORS FOR ALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE. All
those who indulge in alcohol abuse do not develop liver
damage. The incidence of cirrhosis among alcoholics at
autopsy is about 10-15%. Why some individuals are
predisposed to alcoholic cirrhosis is not clearly known, but
a few risk factors have been implicated. These are as under:
1.
Drinking patterns. Most epidemiologic studies have
attributed alcoholic cirrhosis to chronic alcoholism. Available
evidence suggests that chronic and excessive consumption
of alcohol invariably leads to fatty liver in >90% of chronic
alcoholics, progression to alcoholic hepatitis in 10-20% cases,
and eventually to alcoholic cirrhosis in more than 10 years.
It is generally agreed that continued daily imbibing of 60-80
gm of ethanol in any type of alcoholic beverage for at least
10 years is likely to result in alcoholic cirrhosis. Liver injury
is related to the quantity of ethanol contained in alcoholic
beverage consumed and its duration, but not related to the
type of alcoholic beverage consumed. Ethanol content in an
alcoholic beverage is given on the label of the container, but
in general, it s about 4-6% in beer, 10-12% in wine, and about
40-50% in brandy, whisky and scotch. Intermittent drinking
for long duration is less harmful since the liver is given
chance to recover.
2. Gender. Women have increased susceptibility to develop
advanced alcoholic liver disease with much lesser alcohol
intake (20-40 g/day). This gender difference in disease
progression is unclear but is probably linked to effects of
oestrogen.
3.
Malnutrition. Absolute or relative malnutrition of
proteins and vitamins is regarded as a contributory factor in
the evolution of cirrhosis. The combination of chronic alcohol
ingestion and impaired nutrition leads to alcoholic liver
disease and not malnutrition per se. It appears that calories
derived from alcohol displace other nutrients leading to
malnutrition and deficiency of vitamins in alcoholics.
Additional factors contributing to malnutrition in alcoholics
are chronic gastritis and pancreatitis. The evidence in favour
of synergistic effect of malnutrition in chronic alcoholism
comes from clinical and morphologic improvement in cases
of alcoholic cirrhosis on treatment with protein-rich diets.
4. Infections. Intercurrent bacterial infections are common
in cirrhotic patients and may accelerate the course of the
disease. Lesions similar to alcoholic cirrhosis may develop
in non-alcoholic patients who have had viral infections in
the past.
5.
Genetic factors. The rate of ethanol metabolism is under
genetic control. It is chiefly related to altered rates of
elimination of ethanol due to genetic polymorphism for the
two main enzyme systems, MEOS (microsomal P-450
oxidases) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Various HLA
histocompatibility types have been associated with
susceptibility of different populations to alcoholic liver
damage but no single genotype has been identified yet.
6. Hepatitis C infection. Concurrent infection with HCV is
an important risk factor for progression of alcoholic liver
disease. HCV infection in chronic alcoholic leads to
development of alcoholic liver disease with much less alcohol
consumption (20-50 g/day), disease progression at a younger
age, having greater severity, and increased risk to develop
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and overall poorer
survival.
PATHOGENESIS. Exact pathogenesis of alcoholic liver
injury is yet unclear as to why only some chronic alcoholics
develop the complete sequence of changes in the liver while
others don’t.  However, knowledge and understanding of
the ethanol metabolism has resulted in discarding the old
concept of liver injury due to malnutrition. Instead, now it
is known that ethanol and its metabolites are responsible for
ill-effects on the liver in a susceptible chronic alcoholic having
above-mentioned risk factors.  Briefly, the biomedical and
cellular pathogenesis due to chronic alcohol consumption
culminating in morphologic lesions of alcoholic steatosis
(fatty liver), alcoholic hepatitis and alcoholic cirrhosis can
be explained as under and is schematically illustrated in
Fig. 21.22:
1.
Direct hepatotoxicity by ethanol. There is evidence to
suggest that ethanol ingestion for a period of 8-10 days regu-
larly may cause direct hepatotoxic effect on the liver and
produce fatty change. Ethanol is directly toxic to micro-
tubules, mitochondria and membrane of hepatocytes.
2.
Hepatotoxicity by ethanol metabolites. The major
hepatotoxic effects of ethanol are exerted by its metabolites,
chiefly acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde levels in blood are
elevated in chronic alcoholics. Acetaldehyde produces
hepatotoxicity by production of two adducts:
i) Production of protein-aldehyde adducts which are extremely
toxic and can cause cytoskeletal and membrane damage and
bring about hepatocellular necrosis.
ii) Formation of malon-di-aldehyde-acetaldehyde (MAA) adducts
which produce autoantibodies and initiate autoimmune
response. Theses adducts have also a role in hepatic
fibrogenesis due to peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor (PPAR)-γ on hepatocytes.
3.
Oxidative stress. Oxidation of ethanol by the cytochrome-
450 oxidases (MEOS) leads to generation of free radicals
which causes oxidative damage to the membranes and
proteins.
4.
Immunological mechanism. Cell-mediated immunity is
impaired in alcoholic liver disease. Ethanol causes direct

621
CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
immunologic attack on hepatocytes. In a proportion of cases,
alcohol-related liver cell injury continues unabated despite
cessation of alcohol consumption which is attributed to
immunologic mechanisms. Immunological mechanism may
also explain the genesis of Mallory’s alcoholic hyalin though
more favoured hypothesis for its origin is the aggregation of
intermediate filaments of prekeratin type due to alcohol-
induced disorganisation of cytoskeleton.
5.
Inflammation. Chronic ethanol ingestion is not only
injurious to hepatocytes but also damages the intestinal cells.
The injured intestinal cells elaborate endotoxins which
release proinflammatory cytokines, chiefly tumour necrosis
factor-α, IL-1, IL-6 and TGF-β. These cytokines and
endotoxinaemia produce apoptosis and necrosis of
hepatocytes and initiate inflammatory reaction in the alcohol
damaged liver.
6. Fibrogenesis. Main event facilitating hepatic fibrogenesis
is activation of stellate cells by various stimuli:
i) by damaged hepatocytes,
ii) by malon-di-aldehyde-acetaldehyde adducts,
iii) by activated Kupffer cells, and
iv) direct stimulation by acetaldehyde.
All forms of collagen are increased and there is increased
transformation of fat-storing lto cells into myofibroblasts and
fibrocytes.
7. Increased redox ratio. Marked increase in the NADH:NAD
redox ratio in the hepatocytes results in increased redox ratio
of lactate-pyruvate, leading to lactic acidosis. This altered
redox potential has been implicated in a number of metabolic
consequences such as in fatty liver, collagen formation,
occurrence of gout, impaired gluconeogenesis and altered
steroid metabolism.
8.
Retention of liver cell water and proteins. Alcohol is
inhibitory to secretion of newly-synthesised proteins by the
liver leading to their retention in the hepatocytes. Water is
simultaneously retained in the cell in proportion to the
protein and results in swelling of hepatocytes resulting in
hepatomegaly in alcoholics.
9.
Hypoxia. Chronic ingestion of alcohol results in increased
oxygen demand by the liver resulting in a hypoxic state
which causes hepatocellular necrosis in centrilobular zone
(zone 3). Redox changes are also more marked in zone 3.
10. Increased liver fat. The origin of fat in the body was
discussed in Chapter 3 (page 37). In chronic alcoholism, there
is rise in the amount of fat available to the liver which could
be from exogenous (dietary) sources, excess mobilisation
from adipose tissue or increased lipid synthesis by the liver
itself. This may account for lipid accumulation in the
hepatocytes.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Three types of morpho-
logic lesions are described in alcoholic liver disease—
alcoholic steatosis (fatty liver), alcoholic hepatitis and
alcoholic cirrhosis.
1.
ALCOHOLIC STEATOSIS (FATTY LIVER). The
morphologic changes in fatty change in liver have already
been described on page 37 and are briefly considered here.
Grossly, the liver is enlarged, yellow, greasy and firm with
a smooth and glistening capsule.
Microscopically, the features consist of initial micro-
vesicular droplets of fat in the hepatocyte cytoplasm
followed by more common and pronounced feature of
macrovesicular large droplets of fat displacing the nucleus
to the periphery (Fig. 21.23). Fat cysts may develop due to
coalescence and rupture of fat-containing hepatocytes.
Less often, lipogranulomas consisting of collection of
lymphocytes, macrophages and some multinucleate giant
cells may be found.
2.
ALCOHOLIC HEPATITIS. Alcoholic hepatitis
develops acutely, usually following a bout of heavy drin-
king. Repeated episodes of alcoholic hepatitis super-
imposed on pre-existing fatty liver are almost certainly a
forerunner of alcoholic cirrhosis.
Histologically, the features of alcoholic hepatitis are as
follows (Fig. 21.24):
i)
Hepatocellular necrosis: Single or small clusters of
hepatocytes, especially in the centrilobular area (zone 3),
undergo ballooning degeneration and necrosis.
ii) Mallory bodies or alcoholic hyalin: These are
eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusions seen in
perinuclear location within swollen and ballooned
hepatocytes. They represent aggregates of cytoskeletal
intermediate filaments (prekeratin). They can be best
visualised with connective tissue stains like Masson’s
trichrome and chromophobe aniline blue, or by the use
of immunoperoxidase methods. Mallory bodies are highly
suggestive of, but not specific for, alcoholic hepatitis since
Figure 21.22
Pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease.

622
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Mallory bodies are also found in certain other conditions
such as: primary biliary cirrhosis, Indian childhood
cirrhosis, cholestatic syndromes, Wilson’s disease,
intestinal bypass surgery, focal nodular hyperplasia and
hepatocellular carcinoma.
iii) Inflammatory response: The areas of hepatocellular
necrosis and regions of Mallory bodies are associated with
an inflammatory infiltrate, chiefly consisting of
polymorphs and some scattered mononuclear cells. In
more extensive necrosis, the inflammatory infiltrate is
more widespread and may involve the entire lobule.
iv) Fibrosis: Most cases of alcoholic hepatitis are
accompanied by pericellular and perivenular fibrosis,
producing a web-like or chickenwire-like appearance. This
is also termed as creeping collagenosis.
3.
ALCOHOLIC CIRRHOSIS. Alcoholic cirrhosis is the
most common form of lesion, constituting 60-70% of all
cases of cirrhosis. Several terms have been used for this
type of cirrhosis such as Laennec’s cirrhosis, portal cirrhosis,
hobnail cirrhosis, nutritional cirrhosis, diffuse cirrhosis and
micronodular cirrhosis.
Grossly, alcoholic cirrhosis classically begins as
micronodular cirrhosis (nodules less than 3 mm diameter),
the liver being large, fatty and weighing usually above
2 kg (Fig. 21.25). Eventually over a span of years, the liver
shrinks to less than 1 kg in weight, becomes non-fatty,
having macronodular cirrhosis (nodules larger than 3 mm
in diameter), resembling post-necrotic cirrhosis. The
nodules of the liver due to their fat content are tawny-
yellow, on the basis of which Laennec in 1818 introduced
Figure 21.23
Fatty liver (alcoholic steatosis). Most of the hepatocytes are distended with large lipid vacuoles with peripherally displaced nuclei.
Figure 21.24
Alcoholic hepatitis. Liver cells show ballooning degeneration and necrosis with some containing Mallory’s hyalin (Inbox). Fatty
change and clusters of neutrophils are also present.

623
CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
the term cirrhosis first of all (from Greek kirrhos = tawny).
The surface of liver in alcoholic cirrhosis is studded with
diffuse nodules which vary little in size, producing
hobnail liver (because of the resemblance of the surface
with the sole of an old-fashioned shoe having short nails
with heavy heads). On cut section, spheroidal or angular
nodules of fibrous septa are seen.
Microscopically, alcoholic cirrhosis is a progressive
alcoholic liver disease. Its features include the following
(Fig. 21.26):
i)
Nodular pattern: Normal lobular architecture is
effaced in which central veins are hard to find and is
replaced with nodule formation.
ii) Fibrous septa: The fibrous septa that divide the hepatic
parenchyma into nodules are initially delicate and extend
from central vein to portal regions, or portal tract to portal
tract, or both. As the fibrous scarring increases with time,
the fibrous septa become dense and more confluent.
iii) Hepatic parenchyma: The hepatocytes in the islands
of surviving parenchyma undergo slow proliferation
Figure 21.26
Alcoholic cirrhosis, microscopic appearance. It shows nearly uniform-sized micronodules, devoid of central veins and having
thick fibrous septa dividing them. There is minimal inflammation and some reactive bile duct proliferation in the septa.

pattern in gross specimen. There is diffuse nodularity (nodules less than

forming regenerative nodules having disorganised masses
of hepatocytes. The hepatic parenchyma within the
nodules shows extensive fatty change early in the disease.
But as the fibrous septa become more thick, the amount
of fat in hepatocytes is reduced. Thus, there is an inverse
relationship between the amount of fat and the amount
of fibrous scarring in the nodules.
iv) Necrosis, inflammation and bile duct proliferation:
The etiologic clue to diagnosis in the form of Mallory
bodies is hard to find in a fully-developed alcoholic
cirrhosis. The fibrous septa usually contain sparse
infiltrate of mononuclear cells with some bile duct
proliferation. Bile stasis and increased cytoplasmic
haemosiderin deposits due to enhanced iron absorption
in alcoholic cirrhosis are some other noticeable findings.
LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS. The clinical manifestations
and complications of cirrhosis in general are described on
page 630. The laboratory findings in the course of alcoholic
liver disease may be quite variable and liver biopsy is
necessary in doubtful cases. Progressive form of the disease,
however, generally presents the following biochemical and
haematological alterations:
1.
Elevated transaminases: increase in SGOT (AST) is more
than that of SGPT (ALT).
2.
Rise in serum γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT).
3.
Elevation in serum alkaline phosphatase.
4.
Hyperbilirubinaemia.
5.
Hypoproteinaemia with reversal of albumin-globulin
ratio.
6.
Prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin
time.
7.
Anaemia.
8. Neutrophilic leucocytosis in alcoholic hepatitis and in
secondary infections.
Post-necrotic Cirrhosis
Post-necrotic cirrhosis, also termed post-hepatitic cirrhosis,
macronodular cirrhosis and coarsely nodular cirrhosis, is
characterised by large and irregular nodules with broad
bands of connective tissue and occurring most commonly
after previous viral hepatitis.
ETIOLOGY. Based on epidemiologic and serologic studies,
the following factors have been implicated in the etiology of
post-necrotic cirrhosis.
1.
Viral hepatitis. About 25% of patients give history of
recent or remote attacks of acute viral hepatitis followed by
chronic viral hepatitis. Most common association is with
hepatitis B and C; hepatitis A is not known to evolve into
cirrhosis. It is estimated that about 20% cases of HBV chronic
hepatitis and about 20-30% cases of HCV chronic hepatitis
go to develop cirrhosis over 20-30 years.
2.
Drugs and chemical hepatotoxins. A small percentage
of cases may have origin from toxicity due to chemicals and
drugs such as phosphorus, carbon tetrachloride, mushroom
poisoning, acetaminophen and α-methyl dopa.
3.
Others. Certain infections (e.g. brucellosis), parasitic
infestations (e.g. clonorchiasis), metabolic diseases (e.g.
Wilson’s disease or hepatolenticular degeneration) and
advanced alcoholic liver disease may produce a picture of
post-necrotic cirrhosis.
4.
Idiopathic. After all these causes have been excluded, a
group of cases remain in which the etiology is unknown.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Typically, post-necrotic
cirrhosis is macronodular type.
Grossly, the liver is usually small, weighing less than
1 kg, having distorted shape with irregular and coarse
scars and nodules of varying size (Fig. 21.27). Sectioned
Figure 21.27

625
CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
surface shows scars and nodules varying in diameter from
3 mm to a few centimeters.
Microscopically, the features are as follows (Fig. 21.28):
1.
Nodular pattern: The normal lobular architecture of
hepatic parenchyma is mostly lost and is replaced by
nodules larger than those in alcoholic cirrhosis. However,
uninvolved portal tracts and central veins in the hepatic
lobules can still be seen in some parts of surviving
parenchyma.
2.
Fibrous septa: The fibrous septa dividing the variable-
sized nodules are generally thick.
3.
Necrosis, inflammation and bile duct proliferation:
Active liver cell necrosis is usually inconspicuous. Fibrous
septa contain prominent mononuclear inflammatory cell
infiltrate which may even form follicles, especially in cases
following HCV chronic hepatitis. Often there is extensive
proliferation of bile ductules derived from collapsed liver
lobules.
4.
Hepatic parenchyma: Liver cells vary considerably in
size and multiple large nuclei are common in regenerative
nodules. Fatty change may or may not be present in the
hepatocytes.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Besides the general clinical features
described on page 630, post-necrotic cirrhosis is seen as
frequent in women as in men, especially in the younger age
group. Like in alcoholic cirrhosis, the patients may remain
asymptomatic or may present with prominent signs and
symptoms of chronic hepatitis (page 611). Splenomegaly and
hypersplenism are other prominent features. The results of
haematologic and liver function test are similar to those of
alcoholic cirrhosis. Out of the various types of cirrhosis, post-
necrotic cirrhosis, especially when related to hepatitis B and
C virus infection in early life, is more frequently associated
with hepatocellular carcinoma.
Biliary Cirrhosis
Biliary cirrhosis is defined as a chronic disorder characterised
by clinical, biochemical and morphological features of long-
continued cholestasis of intrahepatic or extrahepatic origin.
Biliary cirrhosis is of following types:
Primary biliary cirrhosis in which the destructive process
of unknown etiology affects intrahepatic bile ducts.
Secondary biliary cirrhosis resulting from prolonged
mechanical obstruction of the extrahepatic biliary passages.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis and autoimmune
cholangiopathy causing biliary cirrhosis.
ETIOLOGY. The etiology of these forms of biliary cirrhosis
is distinctive:
A. Primary biliary cirrhosis. The etiology of this type
remains unknown. However, a few factors have been
implicated:
1.
The condition is predominant in middle-aged women
(male: female ratio = 1:9) and has led to the suggestion of a
possible endocrine origin.
2.
Familial incidence has been observed suggesting the role
of some genetic influence and certain HLA types.
3.
There is elevated cholesterol level with appearance of
xanthoma and xanthelasma. Hepatomegaly and chronic liver
disease are late features of the disease.
4.
However, presently the most widely accepted hypothesis
is autoimmune origin of the disease. In support are the
following observations:
increased incidence of associated autoimmune diseases
(e.g. scleroderma, Sjögren’s syndrome, CREST syndrome,
and autoimmune thyroiditis),
circulating anti-mitochondrial antibody of IgG class
detected in more than 90% cases;
elevated levels of immunoglobulins, particularly of IgM;
increased levels of circulating immune complexes;
decreased number of circulating T-cells; and
accumulation of T cells around bile ducts.
Figure 21.28
Post-necrotic cirrhosis. Fibrous septa dividing the hepatic parenchyma into nodules are thick and contain prominent mononuclear
inflammatory cell infiltrate and bile ductular hyperplasia. A few intact hepatic lobules remain.

626
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
B. Secondary biliary cirrhosis. Most cases of secondary
biliary cirrhosis result from prolonged obstruction of
extrahepatic biliary passages (page 599). These causes
include the following:
1.
Extrahepatic cholelithiasis, most common
2.
Biliary atresia
3.
Cancer of biliary tree and of head of pancreas
4.
Postoperative strictures with superimposed ascending
cholangitis.
C. Cirrhosis due to primary sclerosing cholangitis. Primary
or idiopathic sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic cholestatic
syndrome of unknown etiology. It is characterised by
progressive, inflammatory, sclerosing and obliterative
process affecting the entire biliary passages, both extra-
hepatic and intrahepatic ducts. Although etiology remains
unknown, various mechanisms have been postulated which
include viral and bacterial infections, immunologic injury,
toxins, and genetic predisposition.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, in biliary
cirrhosis of all types, the liver is initially enlarged and
characteristically greenish in appearance, but later becomes
smaller, firmer and coarsely micronodular. In cirrohosis
due to primary sclerosing cholangitis, there is charac-
teristic beading of intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts due
to irregular strictures and dilatation.
Microscopically, the features of intra- and extrahepatic
cholestasis correspond to primary and secondary biliary
cirrhosis respectively discussed on page 599. The salient
features of various forms of biliary cirrhosis are as under:
A. Primary biliary cirrhosis: The diagnostic histologic
feature is a chronic, non-suppurative, destructive
cholangitis involving intrahepatic bile ducts. The disease
evolves through the following 4 histologic states:
Stage I: There are florid bile duct lesions confined to portal
tracts. The changes in the affected area consist of
destruction of bile ducts, presence of bile plugs, infiltration
with acute and chronic inflammatory cells and sometimes
formation of granulomas and lymphoid follicles.
Stage II: There is ductular proliferation. The ductal involve-
ment is quite widespread with very few normal bile ducts.
The inflammatory infiltrate too extends beyond the portal
tracts into surrounding hepatic parenchyma. Periportal
Mallory bodies may be present.
Stage III: This stage is characterised by fibrous scarring
interconnecting the portal areas. There is diminished
inflammatory infiltrate and reduced number of bile ducts.
Stage IV: Well-formed micronodular pattern of cirrhosis
develops in a period of a few years (Fig. 21.29).
B. Secondary biliary cirrhosis: Prolonged obstruction of
extrahepatic bile ducts may produce the following
histologic changes:
1.
Bile stasis, degeneration and focal areas of centrilobular
necrosis of hepatocytes.
2.
Proliferation, dilatation and rupture of bile ductules
in the portal area with formation of bile lakes.
3.
Cholangitis, sterile or pyogenic, with accumulation of
polymorphs around the bile ducts.
4.
Progressive expansion of the portal tract by fibrosis and
evolution into micronodular cirrhosis.
C. Cirrhosis due to primary sclerosing cholangitis:
Following changes are seen:
1.
Fibrosing cholangitis with lymphocytic infiltrate around
bile ducts with segmental involvement.
2.
Periductal fibrosis with eventual obliteration of lumen
of affected bile ducts.
3.
Intervening bile ducts are dilated, tortuous and
inflamed.
4.
Late cases show cholestasis and full-blown picture of
biliary cirrhosis.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Clinical features of the three types
of biliary cirrhosis are variable:
Primary biliary cirrhosis may remain asymptomatic for
months to years. Symptoms develop insidiously. Basically,
it is a cholestatic disorder. The patients present with
persistent pruritus, dark urine, pale stools, steatorrhoea,
jaundice and skin pigmentation. The earliest laboratory
finding is a markedly elevated serum alkaline phosphatase
level. Elevation of serum lipids is accompanied by
appearance of periorbital xanthelasma and xanthomas over
joints. Death usually results from hepatic failure, variceal
bleeding, intercurrent infections and concomitant
development of cancers of liver and breast.
The diagnosis of secondary biliary cirrhosis is considered
in patients with previous history of gallstones, biliary tract
surgery or clinical features of ascending cholangitis.
The patients of primary sclerosing cholangitis may
remain asymptomatic or may show features of cholestatic
jaundice (raised alkaline phosphatase, pruritus, fatigue). Late
cases show manifestations of chronic liver disease. The
disease occurs in 3rd to 5th decade of life with two fold
preponderance in males.
Figure 21.29
Primary biliary cirrhosis, diagrammatic representation.
There are fibrous scars dividing the hepatic parenchyma into the
micronodules. The fibrous septa contain prominent lymphoid infiltrate
and proliferated bile ducts. Many of the hepatocytes contain elongated
bile plugs.

627
CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
The contrasting features of three main types of
intrahepatic disorders leading to biliary cirrhosis are
summarised in Table 21.9.
Pigment Cirrhosis in Haemochromatosis
Haemochromatosis is an iron-storage disorder in which there
is excessive accumulation of iron in parenchymal cells with
eventual tissue damage and functional insufficiency of
organs such as the liver, pancreas, heart and pituitary gland.
The condition is characterised by a triad of features—
micronodular pigment cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus and skin
pigmentation. On the basis of the last two features, the disease
has also come to be termed as ‘bronze diabetes’. Males
predominate and manifest earlier since women have
physiologic iron loss delaying the effects of excessive
accumulation of iron. Haemochromatosis exists in 2 main
forms:
1.
Idiopathic (primary, genetic) haemochromatosis is an
autosomal recessive disorder of excessive accumulation of
iron. It is associated with overexpression of HFE gene located
on chromosome 6 close to the HLA gene locus, and normally
regulates intestinal absorption of iron. Mutated
(overexpressed) HFE gene complexes with transferrin
receptor on intestinal crypt epithelial cells and results in
excessive absoption of dietary iron throughout life.
2.
Secondary (acquired) haemochromatosis is gross iron
overload with tissue injury arising secondary to other
diseases such as thalassaemia, sideroblastic anaemias,
alcoholic cirrhosis or multiple transfusions.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. A general discussion of iron
metabolism and iron excess states is given on page 41.
Normally, the body iron content is 3-4 gm which is
maintained in such a way that intestinal mucosal absorp-
tion of iron is equal to its loss. This amount is approximately
1 mg/day in men and 1.5 mg/day in menstruating women.
In haemochromatosis, however, this amount goes up to 4
mg/day or more, as evidenced by elevated serum iron
(normal about 125 μg/dl) and increased serum transferrin
saturation (normal 30%).
In idiopathic or hereditary haemochromatosis, the
primary mechanism of disease appears to be the genetic basis
in which the defect may either lie at the intestinal mucosal
level causing excessive iron absorption, or at the post-
absorption excretion level leading to excessive accumulation
of iron. The excess iron in primary haemochromatosis is
deposited mainly in the cytoplasm of parenchymal cells of
organs such as the liver, pancreas, spleen, heart and
endocrine glands. Tissue injury results from iron-laden
lysosomes of parenchymal cells and lipid peroxidation of cell
organelles by excess iron.
In secondary or acquired haemochromatosis, there is
excessive accumulation of iron due to acquired causes like
ineffective erythropoiesis, defective haemoglobin synthesis,
multiple blood transfusions and enhanced absorption of iron
due to alcohol consumption. The last-named phenomenon
is observed in Bantu siderosis affecting South African Bantu
tribals who consume large quantities of home-brew prepared
in iron vessels. Cases of secondary haemochromatosis have
increased iron storage within the reticuloendothelial system
and liver. However, the magnitude of the iron excess in
secondary haemochromatosis is generally insufficient to
cause tissue damage.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Excessive deposition of
iron in organs and tissues is ferritin and haemosiderin,
both of which appear as golden-yellow pigment granules
in the cytoplasm of affected parenchymal cells and
haemosiderin stains positively with Prussian blue
reaction. The organs most frequently affected are the liver
and pancreas, and to a lesser extent, the heart, endocrine
glands, skin, synovium and testis.
In the liver, excess of pigment accumulates in the
hepatocytes, and less often Kupffer cells and in bile duct
epithelium. The deposits in the initial stage may be
prominent in the periportal liver cells along with increased
fibrosis in the portal zone. Eventually, micronodular
cirrhosis develops. The deposits may produce grossly
chocolate-brown colour of the liver and nodular surface.
In the pancreas, pigmentation is less intense and is
found in the acinar and islet cells. The deposits in pancreas
produce diffuse interstitial fibrosis and atrophy of
parenchymal cells leading to occurrence of diabetes
mellitus.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The major clinical manifestations
of haemochromatosis include skin pigmentation, diabetes

mellitus, hepatic and cardiac dysfunction, arthropathy and
hypogonadism. Characteristic bronze pigmentation is the
presenting feature in about 90% of cases. Demonstration of
excessive parenchymal iron stores is possible by measure-
ment of serum iron, determination of percent saturation of
transferrin, measurement of serum ferritin concentration,
estimation of chelatable iron stores using chelating agent (e.g.
desferrioxamine), and finally, by liver biopsy. Occurrence
of hepatocellular carcinoma is a late complication of
haemochromatosis-induced cirrhosis.
Cirrhosis in Wilson’s Disease
Wilson’s disease, also termed by a more descriptive desig-
nation of hepatolenticular degeneration, is an autosomal
recessive inherited disease of copper metabolism,
characterised by toxic accumulation of copper in many
tissues, chiefly the liver, brain and eye. These accumulations
lead to the triad of features:
1.
Cirrhosis of the liver.
2.
Bilateral degeneration of the basal ganglia of the brain.
3.
Greenish-brown pigmented rings in the periphery of the
cornea (Kayser-Fleischer rings).
The disease manifests predominantly in children and
young adults (5-30 years). Initially, the clinical manifestations
are referable to liver involvement such as jaundice and
hepatomegaly (hepatic form) but later progressive
neuropsychiatric changes and Kayser-Fleischer rings in the
cornea appear.
PATHOGENESIS. The pathogenesis of Wilson’s disease is
best understood when compared with normal copper
metabolism.
Normally, dietary copper is more than body’s
requirement. Excess copper so absorbed through the stomach
and duodenum is transported to the liver where it is
incorporated into α2-globulin to form ceruloplasmin, which
is excreted by the liver via bile normally. Most of the plasma
copper circulates as ceruloplasmin. Only minute amount of
copper is excreted in the urine normally.
In Wilson’s disease, the initial steps of dietary absorp-
tion and transport of copper to the liver are normal but
copper accumulates in the liver rather than being excreted
by the liver. The underlying defect in chromosome 13 is a
mutation in ATP7B gene, the normal hepatic copper-
excreting gene. Eventually, capacity of hepatocytes to store
copper is exceeded and copper is  released into circulation
which then gets deposited in extrahepatic tissues such as the
brain, eyes and others. However, increased copper in the
kidney does not produce any serious renal dysfunction.
Biochemical abnormalities in Wilson’s disease include the
following:
1
Decreased serum ceruloplasmin (due to impaired synthesis
of apoceruloplasmin in damaged liver and defective
mobilisation of copper from hepatocellular lysosomes).
2.
Increased hepatic copper in liver biopsy (due to excessive
accumulation of copper in the liver).
3.
Increased urinary excretion of copper.
4.
However, serum copper levels are of no diagnostic help
and may vary from low-to-normal-to-high depend- ing upon
the stage of disease.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The liver shows varying
grades of changes that include fatty change, acute and
chronic active hepatitis, submassive liver necrosis and
macronodular cirrhosis. Mallory bodies are present in
some cases. Copper is usually deposited in the periportal
hepatocytes in the form of reddish granules in the
cytoplasm or as reddish cytoplasmic coloration, stainable
by rubeanic acid or rhodamine stains for copper.
Involvement of basal ganglia in the brain is seen in
the form of toxic injury to neurons, in the cornea as
greenish-brown deposits of copper in Descemet’s
membrane, and in the kidney as fatty and hydropic
change.
Cirrhosis in ααααα-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency
Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is an autosomal codominant
condition in which the homozygous state produces liver
disease (cirrhosis), pulmonary disease (emphysema), or both
(page 479). α-1-antitrypsin is a glycoprotein normally
synthesised in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of the
hepatocytes and is the most potent protease inhibitor (Pi). A
single autosomal dominant gene coding for α-1-antitrypsin
is located on long arm of chromosome 14 that codes for
immunoglobulin light chains too. Out of 24 different alleles
labelled alphabetically, PiMM is the most common normal
phenotype, while the most frequent abnormal phenotype in
α-1-antitrypsin deficiency leading to liver and/or lung
disease is PiZZ in homozygote form. Other phenotypes in
which liver disease occurs are PiSS and Pi-null in which
serum α-1-antitrypsin value is nearly totally deficient.
Intermediate phenotypes, PiMZ and PiSZ persons are
predisposed to develop hepatocellular carcinoma.
The patients may present with respiratory disease due
to the development of emphysema, or may develop liver
dysfunction, or both. At birth or in neonates, the features of
cholestatic jaundice of varying severity may appear. In
adolescence, the condition may evolve into hepatitis or
cirrhosis which is usually well compensated.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Pulmonary changes in α-
1-antitrypsin deficiency in the form of emphysema are
described in Chapter 17. The hepatic changes vary
according to the age at which the deficiency becomes
apparent. At birth or in neonates, the histologic features
consist of neonatal hepatitis that may be acute or ‘pure’
cholestasis. Micronodular or macronodular cirrhosis may
appear in childhood or in adolescence in which the
diagnostic feature is the presence of intracellular,
acidophilic, PAS-positive globules in the periportal
hepatocytes. Ultrastructurally, these globules consist of
dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum.
Cardiac Cirrhosis
Cardiac cirrhosis is an uncommon complication of severe
right-sided congestive heart failure of long-standing duration
(page 99). The common causes culminating in cardiac
cirrhosis are cor pulmonale, tricuspid insufficiency or
constrictive pericarditis. The pressure in the right ventricle

629
CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
is elevated which is transmitted to the liver via the inferior
vena cava and hepatic veins. The patients generally have
enlarged and tender liver with mild liver dysfunction.
Splenomegaly occurs due to simple passive congestion.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the liver is
enlarged and firm with stretched Glisson’s capsule.
Histologically, in acute stage, the hepatic sinusoids are
dilated and congested with haemorrhagic necrosis of
centrilobular hepatocytes (central haemorrhagic necrosis).
Severe and more prolonged heart failure results in delicate
fibrous strands radiating from the central veins. These
fibrous strands may form interconnections leading to
cardiac cirrhosis and regenerative nodules.
Indian Childhood Cirrhosis
Indian childhood cirrhosis (ICC) is an unusual form of
cirrhosis seen in children between the age of 6 months and 3
years in rural, middle class, Hindus in India and in parts of
South-East Asia and in the Middle-East. There is no role of
viral infection in its etiology. Instead, a combination of some
common toxic effects and inherited abnormality of copper
metabolism has been suggested. Death occurs due to hepatic
failure within a year of diagnosis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Five histologic types of
ICC have been distinguished of which type II is the most
common. This form is characterised by the following
features:
i) Liver cell injury ranging from ballooning degeneration
to significant damage to hepatocytes.
ii) Prominent Mallory bodies in some hepatocytes without
fatty change.
iii) Neutrophilic and sometimes alongwith lymphocytic
infiltrate.
iv) Creeping pericellular fibrosis which may eventually
lead to fine micro-macro-nodular cirrhosis.
v) There is significant deposition of copper and copper-
associated proteins in hepatocytes, often more than what
is seen in Wilson’s disease.
Thus, the picture resembles acute alcoholic hepatitis
but without the fatty change and with greatly impaired
regeneration. There is marked increase in hepatic copper
since the milk consumed by such infants is often boiled
and stored in copper vessels in India. The condition has
to be distinguished from Wilson’s disease.
Cirrhosis in Autoimmune Hepatitis
Autoimmune hepatitis (also called lupoid hepatitis) is a form
of chronic hepatitis characterised by continued hepatocellular
injury, inflammation and fibrosis which may progress to
cirrhosis. The condition may run a variable natural history
rangingfrom indolent to severe rapid course. This form of
hepatitis has prominent autoimmune etiology is supported
by immunologic abnormalities and a few other characteristic
diagnostic criteria as under:
1. Female gender predisposition.
2.  Predominant elevation of aminotransferases (AST and
ALT).
3.   Hyperglobulinaemia (elevated IgG and γ-globulin).
4. High serum titres of nuclear (ANA), smooth muscle (SMA),
and liver-kidney microsomal (LKM1) autoantibodies, and
absence of antimitochondrial antibodies.
5. Concurrent presence of other autoimmune diseases.
6. Presence of HLA DR3 or HLA DR4 markers.
7. Lack of prominent elevation of alkaline phosphatase.
8. Exclusion of chronic hepatitis of other known etiologies
(viral, toxic, genetic etc).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Autoimmune hepatitis is
morphologically indistinguishable from chronic hepatitis
of viral etiology. Patients who survive active disease
develop crrhosis. There are features of burnt out chronic
autoimmune hepatitis accompanied with cirrhosis.
Cirrhosis in Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD) is a from of hepatitis resembling
alcoholic liver disease but seen in nondrinkers of alcohol.
The condition is seen more commonly in affluent western
socieities, has a strong association with obesity,
dyslipidaemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is seen in
youger patients with equal gender prevalence. Pateints are
generally asymptomatic and are diagnosed by routine
biochemical tests.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The condition is a form of
chronic hepatitis after known causes have been excluded.
About 10-30% cases of NASH progress to increased fibrosis
and develop cirrhosis.
Miscellaneous Forms of Cirrhosis
In addition to the various types of cirrhosis just described, a
few other uncommon types associated with different diseases
are sometimes distinguished. These include the following:
1.
Metabolic disorders e.g. in galactosaemia, hereditary
fructose intolerance, glycogen storage diseases.
2.
Infectious diseases e.g. in brucellosis, schistosomiasis,
syphilis (hepar lobatum) and toxoplasma infection.
3.
Gastrointestinal disorders e.g. in inflammatory bowel
disease, cystic fibrosis of the pancreas and intestinal bypass
surgery for obesity.
4.
Infiltrative diseases e.g. in sarcoidosis.
Cryptogenic Cirrhosis
Finally, when all the known etiologic types of cirrhosis have
been excluded, there remain patients with cirrhosis in whom
the cause is unknown. These cases are grouped under a
waste-basket diagnosis of cryptogenic cirrhosis (crypto =
concealed).
NON-CIRRHOTIC PORTAL FIBROSIS
Non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis (NCPF) is a group of congenital
and acquired diseases in which there is localised or

630
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
generalised hepatic fibrosis without nodular regenerative
activity and there is absence of clinical and functional
evidence of cirrhosis. Besides, the patients of NCPF are
relatively young as compared to those of cirrhosis and
develop repeated bouts of haematemesis in the course of
disease. One of the types associated with increased portal
fibrosis without definite cirrhosis is seen in idiopathic
(primary) portal hypertension with splenomegaly, reported from
India and Japan. The type common in India, particularly in
young males, is related to chronic arsenic ingestion in drinking
water and intake of orthodox medicines. It could also be due
to portal vein thrombosis leading to intimal sclerosis of portal
vein branches. Another variant is congenital hepatic fibrosis
seen in polycystic disease of the liver.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the liver is small,
fibrous and shows prominent fibrous septa on both
external as well as on cut surface forming irregular islands
in the liver.
Histologically, the salient features are as under:
i) Standing out of portal tracts due to their increased
amount of fibrous tissue in triad without significant
inflammation.
ii) Obliterative sclerosis of portal vein branches in the
portal tracts (obliterative portovenopathy).
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND
COMPLICATIONS OF CIRRHOSIS
The range of clinical features in cirrhosis varies widely, from
an asymptomatic state to progressive liver failure and death.
The onset of disease is insidious. In general, the features of
cirrhosis are more marked in the alcoholic form than in other
varieties. These include weakness, fatiguability, weight loss,
anorexia, muscle wasting, and low-grade fever due to
hepatocellular necrosis or some latent infection. Advanced
cases develop a number of complications which are as
follows:
1.
Portal hypertension and its major effects such as ascites,
splenomegaly and development of collaterals (e.g.
oesophageal varices, spider naevi etc) as discussed below.
2.
Progressive hepatic failure and its manifestations as
described already (page 602).
3.
Development of hepatocellular carcinoma, more often in
post-necrotic cirrhosis (HBV and HCV more often) than
following alcoholic cirrhosis (page 634).
4.
Chronic relapsing pancreatitis, especially in alcoholic liver
disease (page 646).
5.
Steatorrhoea due to reduced hepatic bile secretion.
6.
Gallstones usually of pigment type, are seen twice more
frequently in patients with cirrhosis than in general
population.
7.
Infections are more frequent in patients with cirrhosis due
to impaired phagocytic activity of reticuloendothelial system.
8.
Haematologic derangements such as bleeding disorders and
anaemia due to impaired hepatic synthesis of coagulation
factors and hypoalbuminaemia are present.
9.
Cardiovascular complications such as atherosclerosis of
coronaries and aorta and myocardial infarction are more
frequent in cirrhotic patients.
10. Musculoskeletal abnormalities like digital clubbing,
hypertrophic osteoarthropathy and Dupuytren’s contracture
are more common in cirrhotic patients.
11. Endocrine disorders. In males these consist of feminisation
such as gynaecomastia, changes in pubic hair pattern,
testicular atrophy and impotence, whereas in cirrhotic
women amenorrhoea is a frequent abnormality.
12. Hepatorenal syndrome leading to renal failure may occur
in late stages of cirrhosis.
The ultimate causes of death are hepatic coma, massive
gastrointestinal haemorrhage from oesophageal varices
(complication of portal hypertension), intercurrent infections,
hepatorenal syndrome and development of hepatocellular
carcinoma.
PORTAL HYPERTENSION
Increase in pressure in the portal system usually follows
obstruction to the portal blood flow anywhere along its
course. Portal veins have no valves and thus obstruction
anywhere in the portal system raises pressure in all the veins
proximal to the obstruction. However, unless proved
otherwise, portal hypertension means obstruction to the
portal blood flow by cirrhosis of the liver. The normal portal
venous pressure is quite low (10-15 mm saline). Portal
hypertension occurs when the portal pressure is above 30
mm saline. Measurement of intrasplenic pressure reflects
pressure in the splenic vein; the percutaneous transhepatic
pressure provides a measure of pressure in the main portal
vein; and wedged hepatic venous pressure represents
sinusoidal pressure. Measurement of these pressures helps
in localising the site of obstruction and classifying the portal
hypertension.
CLASSIFICATION. Based on the site of obstruction to
portal venous blood flow, portal hypertension is categorised
into 3 main types—intrahepatic, posthepatic and prehepatic
(Table 21.10). Rare cases of idiopathic portal hypertension
showing non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis are encountered as
discussed above.

CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
1.
Intrahepatic portal hypertension. Cirrhosis is by far the
commonest cause of portal hypertension. Other less frequent
intrahepatic causes are metastatic tumours, non-cirrhotic
nodular regenerative conditions, hepatic venous obstruction
(Budd-Chiari syndrome), veno-occlusive disease,
schistosomiasis, diffuse granulomatous diseases and
extensive fatty change. In cirrhosis and other conditions,
there is obstruction to the portal venous flow by fibrosis,
thrombosis and pressure by regenerative nodules. About 30-
60% patients of cirrhosis develop significant portal
hypertension.
2.
Posthepatic portal hypertension. This is uncommon and
results from obstruction to the blood flow through hepatic
vein into inferior vena cava. The causes are neoplastic
occlusion and thrombosis of the hepatic vein or of the inferior
vena cava (including Budd-Chiari syndrome). Prolonged
congestive heart failure and constrictive pericarditis may also
cause portal hypertension by transmitting the elevated
pressure through the hepatic vessels into the portal vein.
3.
Prehepatic portal hypertension. Blockage of portal flow
before portal blood reaches the hepatic sinusoids results in
prehepatic portal hypertension. Such conditions are
thrombosis and neoplastic obstruction of the portal vein
before it ramifies in the liver, myelofibrosis, and congenital
absence of portal vein.
MAJOR SEQUELAE OF PORTAL HYPERTENSION.
Irrespective of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis
of portal hypertension, there are 4 major clinical conse-
quences—ascites, varices (collateral channels or portosystemic
shunts), splenomegaly and hepatic encephalopathy (Fig. 21.30).
1.
Ascites. Ascites is the accumulation of excessive volume
of fluid within the peritoneal cavity. It frequently
accompanies cirrhosis and other diffuse liver diseases. The
development of ascites is associated with haemodilution,
oedema and decreased urinary output. Ascitic fluid is
generally transudate with specific gravity of 1.010, protein
content below 3 gm/dl and electrolyte concentrations like
those of other extracellular fluids. It may contain a few
mesothelial cells and mononuclear cells. Presence of
neutrophils is suggestive of secondary infection and red
blood cells in ascitic fluid points to disseminated intra-
abdominal cancer. However, some cases of ascites may
develop serious complication of spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis characterised by sponateneous infection of the
ascitic fluid without any intrabdminal infection.
Pathogenesis. The ascites becomes clinically detectable when
more than 500 ml of fluid has accumulated in the peritoneal
cavity. The mechanisms involved in its formation were
discussed in Chapter 5. Briefly, the systemic and local factors
favouring ascites formation are as under (Fig. 21.31):
A. Systemic Factors:
i)
Decreased plasma colloid oncotic pressure. There is
hypoalbuminaemia from impaired hepatic synthesis of
plasma proteins including albumin, as well as from loss of
albumin from the blood plasma into the peritoneal cavity.
Hypoalbuminaemia, in turn, causes reduced plasma oncotic
pressure and leads to loss of water into extravascular space.
ii) Hyperaldosteronism. In cirrhosis, there is increased
aldosterone secretion by the adrenal gland, probably due to
reduced renal blood flow, and impaired hepatic metabolism
and excretion of aldosterone.
iii) Impaired renal excretion. Reduced renal blood flow and
excessive release of antidiuretic hormone results in renal
retention of sodium and water and impaired renal excretion.
B. Local  Factors:
i)
Increased portal pressure. Portal venous pressure is not
directly related to ascites formation but portal hypertension
in combination with other factors contributes to the formation
and localisation of the fluid retention in the peritoneal cavity.
ii) Increased hepatic lymph formation. Obstruction of hepatic
vein such as in Budd-Chiari syndrome and increased intra-
sinusoidal pressure found in cirrhotic patients stimulates
hepatic lymph formation that oozes through the surface of
the liver.
2.
Varices (Collateral channels or Porto-systemic shunts).
As a result of rise in portal venous pressure and obstruction
in the portal circulation within or outside the liver, the blood
tends to bypass the liver and return to the heart by
development of porto-systemic collateral channels (or shunts
or varices). These varices develop at sites where the systemic
and portal circulations have common capillary beds. The
principal sites are as under:
i)
Oesophageal varices: The development of oesophago-
gastric varices which is frequently manifested by massive
Figure 21.30
Major clinical consequences of portal hypertension.

632
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
haematemesis is the most important consequence of portal
hypertension (page 539).
ii) Haemorrhoids: Development of collaterals between the
superior, middle and inferior haemorrhoidal veins resulting
in haemorrhoids is another common accompaniment.
Bleeding from haemorrhoids is usually not as serious a
complication as haematemesis from oesophageal varices.
iii) Caput medusae: Anastomoses between the portal and
systemic veins may develop between the hilum of the liver
and the umbilicus along the paraumbilical plexus of veins
resulting in abdominal wall collaterals. These appear as
dilated subcutaneous veins radiating from the umbilicus and
are termed caput medusae (named after the snake-haired
Medusa).
iv) Retroperitoneal anastomoses: In the retroperitoneum,
portocaval anastomoses may be established through the
veins of Retzius and the veins of Sappey.
3.
Splenomegaly. The enlargement of the spleen in
prolonged portal hypertension is called congestive
splenomegaly (page 387). The spleen may weigh 500-1000
gm and is easily palpable. The spleen is larger in young
people and in macronodular cirrhosis than in micronodular
cirrhosis.
4.
Hepatic encephalopathy. Porto-systemic venous
shunting may result in a complex metabolic and organic
syndrome of the brain characterised by disturbed consci-
ousness, neurologic signs and flapping tremors. Hepatic
encephalopathy is particularly associated with advanced
hepatocellular disease such as in cirrhosis.
HEPATIC TUMOURS AND TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS
The liver is the site for benign tumours, tumour-like lesions,
and both primary and metastatic malignant tumours.
However, metastatic tumours are much more common than
primary tumours and tumour-like lesions. Primary hepatic
tumours may arise from hepatic cells, bile duct epithelium, or
mesodermal structures (Table 21.11).
TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS
These include cysts in the liver and focal nodular hyperplasia.
Hepatic Cysts
Cysts in the liver may be single or multiple. These cysts are
mainly of 3 types—congenital, simple (nonparasitic) and
hydatid (Echinococcus) cysts.
1.
CONGENITAL CYSTS. These are uncommon. They are
usually small (less than 1 cm in diameter) and are lined by
biliary epithelium. They may be single, or occur as polycystic
liver disease, often associated with polycystic kidney. On
occasions, these cysts have abundant connective tissue and

numerous ducts, warranting the designation of congenital
hepatic fibrosis.
2.
SIMPLE (NON-PARASITIC) CYSTS. Simple cysts are
solitary non-parasitic cysts seen more frequently in middle-
aged women. The cyst is usually large (up to 20 cm in
diameter), lying underneath the Glisson’s capsule and filled
with serous fluid. The cyst produces a palpable mass and
may be associated with jaundice.
Histologically, the cyst wall is composed of compact
fibrous tissue and is lined by low columnar to cuboid
epithelium and occasionally by squamous lining.
3.
HYDATID (ECHINOCOCCUS) CYSTS. Hydatid cyst
has already been discussed on page 616.
Focal Nodular Hyperplasia
The etiology of focal nodular hyperplasia is not known but
these lesions are more common in women taking oral
contraceptives.
Grossly, Focal nodular hyperplasia is a well-demarcated
tumour-like nodule occurring underneath the Glisson’s
capsule. The nodules may be single or multiple,
measuring about 5 cm in diameter. It may be tan-yellow
or bile-stained. The sectioned surface shows a central
fibrous scar.
Histologically, it is composed of collagenous septa
radiating from the central fibrous scar which separate
nodules of normal hepatocytes without portal triads or
central hepatic veins. The fibrous septa contain prominent
lymphocytic infiltrate.
BENIGN HEPATIC TUMOURS
These are uncommon and some of them are incidental
autopsy findings. These include hepatocellular (liver cell)
adenoma, bile duct adenoma (cholangioma) and
haemangioma.
Hepatocellular (Liver Cell) Adenoma
Adenomas arising from hepatocytes are rare and are reported
in women in reproductive age group in association with use
of oral contraceptives, sex hormone therapy and with
pregnancy. The tumour presents as intrahepatic mass that
may be mistaken for hepatocellular carcinoma and may
rupture causing severe intraperitoneal haemorrhage.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour
usually occurs singly but about 10% are multiple. It is
partly or completely encapsulated and slightly lighter in
colour than adjacent liver or may be bile-stained. The
tumours vary from a few centimetres up to 30 cm in
diameter. On cut section, many of the tumours have
varying degree of infarction and haemorrhage.
Histologically, liver cell adenomas are composed of sheets
and cords of hepatocytes which may be normal-looking
or may show slight variation in size and shape but no
mitoses. The hepatocytes in adenomas contain greater
amount of glycogen than the surrounding liver cells and
may sometimes show fatty change. Hepatocellular
adenomas lack portal tracts and bile ducts but bile
canaliculi containing bile-plugs may be present.
Numerous blood vessels are generally present in the
tumour which may be thrombosed. Thrombosis leads to
infarction and may result in rupture with intraperitoneal
haemorrhage.
Bile Duct Adenoma (Cholangioma)
Intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile duct adenoma is a rare
benign tumour. The tumour may be small, composed of acini
lined by biliary epithelium and separated by variable amount
of connective tissue, or are larger cystadenomas having loculi
lined by biliary epithelium.
Haemangioma
Haemangioma is the commonest benign tumour of the liver.
Majority of them are asymptomatic and discovered
incidentally. Rarely, a haemangioma may rupture into the
peritoneal cavity.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, haemangiomas
appear as solitary or multiple, circumscribed, red-purple
lesions, commonly subcapsular and varying from a few
millimetres to a few centimetres in diameter. They are
commonly cavernous type giving the sectioned surface a
spongy appearance.
Histologically, haemangioma of the liver shows
characteristic large, cavernous, blood-filled spaces, lined
by a single layer of endothelium and separated by
connective tissue (Fig. 21.32). Some haemangiomas
may undergo progressive fibrosis and may later get
calcified.
MALIGNANT HEPATIC TUMOURS
Among the primary malignant tumours of the liver,
hepatocellular (liver cell) carcinoma accounts for approxi-
mately 85% of all primary malignant tumours,
cholangiocarcinoma for about 5-10%, and infrequently mixed
pattern is seen. The remainder are rare tumours that include
hepatoblastoma, haemangiosarcoma (angiosarcoma) and
embryonal sarcoma. Hepatic haemangiosarcoma and
embryonal sarcoma resemble in morphology with their
counterparts elsewhere in the body.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or liver cell carcinoma, also
trmed as hepatoma, is the most common primary malignant
tumour of the liver. The tumour shows marked geographic
variations in incidence which is closely related to HBV and
HCV infection in the region. Whereas the prevalence of HCC
is less than 1% of all autopsies in the United States and
Europe, the incidence in sub-Saharan Africa and South-East

634
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Asia (particularly China) is high (2-8%). Liver cell cancer is
more common in males than in females in the ratio of 4:1.
The peak incidence occurs in 5th to 6th decades of life but in
high incidence areas where HBV and HCV infection is
prevalent, it occurs a decade or two earlier. The tumour
supervenes on cirrhosis in 70-80% of cases.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. A number of etiologic factors are
implicated in the etiology of HCC, most important being HBV
and HCV infection, and association with cirrhosis.
1.
Relation to HBV infection. Genesis of HCC is linked to
prolonged infection with HBV. The evidence in support is
both epidemiologic and direct.
i)
The incidence of HBsAg positivity is higher in HCC
patients. For example, in Taiwan, HBsAg-positive carriers
have more than 200 times greater risk of developing HCC
than HBsAg-negative patients, particularly when the
infection is acquired in early life.
ii) In African and Asian patients, 95% cases of HCC have
anti-HBc.
iii) There is more direct evidence of integration of HBV-DNA
genome in the genome of tumour cells of HCC.
2.
Relation to HCV infection. Long-standing HCV infection
has emereged as a major factor in the etiology of HCC,
generally after more than 30 years of infection. The evidences
in support are as under:
i)
In developed countries where higher incidence of HCC
was earlier attributed to endemic HBV infection (e.g. in
Japan) has shown a remarkable shift to HCV infection.
However, in developing countries HBV is still the
predominant etiologic factor in the pathogenesis of HCC.
ii) The patients having anti-HCV and anti-HBc antibodies
together have three times higher risk of developing HCC than
in those with either antibody alone.
iii) HCV infection after a long interval produces cirrohosis
more often prior to development of HCC, while in HCC
following HBV infection half the cases have cirrohosis and
remainder have chronic hepatitis.
iv) It is also possible that HBV and HCV infection act
synergistically to predispose to HCC.
3.
Relation to cirrhosis. Cirrhosis of all etiologic types is
more commonly associated with HCC but the most frequent
association is with macronodular post-necrotic cirrhosis. The
mechanism of progression to HCC appears to be chronic
regenerative activity in cirrhosis, or that the damaged liver
in cirrhosis is rendered vulnerable to carcinogenic influences.
Liver cell dysplasia identified by cellular enlargement, nuclear
hyperchromatism and multinucleate cells, is found in 60%
of cirrhotic livers with HCC and in only 10% of non-cirrhotic
livers.
4.
Relation to alcohol. It has been observed that alcoholics
have about four-fold increased risk of developing HCC. It is
possible that alcohol may act as co-carcinogen with HBV or
HCV infection, but alcohol does not appear to be a hepatic
carcinogen per se.
5.
Mycotoxins. An important mycotoxin, aflatoxin B1,
produced by a mould Aspergillus flavus, can contaminate
poorly stored wheat grains or groundnuts, especially in deve-
loping countries. Aflatoxin B1 is carcinogenic; it may act as
a co-carcinogen with hepatitis B or may suppress the cellular
immune response.
6.
Chemical carcinogens. A number of chemical carci-
nogens can induce liver cancer in experimental animals.
These include butter-yellow and nitrosamines used as
common food additives.
7.
Miscellaneous factors. Limited role of various other
factors in HCC has been observed. These include the
following:
i)
haemochromatosis;
ii) α-1-antitrypsin deficiency;
iii) prolonged immunosuppressive therapy in renal
transplant patients;
iv) other types of viral hepatitis;
v) tobacco smoking; and
vi) parasitic infestations such as clonorchiasis and
schistosomiasis.

CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
Pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma can be explained
on the basis of genetic mutations induced by one of the above
major etiologic factors. In many cases, this mutated gene has
been identified as inactivation of tumour suppressor
oncogene p53 by HBV that results in disruption of normal
growth control. In this regards, the role of X-protein (HBxAg)
generated from X-gene of HBV has been found to contribute
to carcinogenesis by binding to p53.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, HCC may form
one of the following 3 patterns of growth, in decreasing
order of frequency (Fig. 21.33):
i)
Expanding type: Most frequently, it forms a single,
yellow-brown, large mass, most often in the right lobe of
the liver with central necrosis, haemorrhage and
occasional bile-staining (Fig. 21.34). It may be deceptively
encapsulated.
ii) Multifocal type: Less often, multifocal, multiple masses,
3-5 cm in diameter, scattered throughout the liver are seen.
iii) Infiltrating (Spreading) type: Rarely, the HCC forms
diffusely infiltrating tumour mass.
Microscopically, the tumour cells in the typical HCC
resemble hepatocytes but vary with the degree of
differentiation, ranging from well-differentiated to highly
anaplastic lesions. Most of the HCC have trabecular
growth pattern. The tumour cells have a tendency to
invade and grow along blood vessels. Thus important
diagnostic features are the patterns of tumour cells and their
cytologic features:
1.
Histologic patterns: These include the following:
i)
Trabecular or sinusoidal pattern is the most common. The
trabeculae are made up of 2-8 cell wide layers of tumour
cells separated by vascular spaces or sinusoids which are
endothelium-lined (Fig. 21.35).
ii) Pseudoglandular or acinar pattern is seen sometimes. The
tumour cells are disposed around central cystic space
formed by degeneration and breakdown in solid
trabeculae.
iii) Compact pattern resembles trabecular pattern but the
tumour cells form large solid masses with inconspicuous
sinusoids.
iv) Scirrhous pattern is characterised by more abundant
fibrous stroma.
2
Cytologic features: The typical cytologic features in
the HCC consist of cells resembling hepatocytes having
vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli. The cytoplasm
is granular and eosinophilic but becomes increasingly
basophilic with increasing malignancy. Aside from these
features, a few other cytologic variants are: pleomorphism,
bizarre giant cell formation, spindle-shaped cells, tumour
cells with clear cytoplasm, presence of bile within dilated
canaliculi, and intracytoplasmic Mallory’s hyalin.
Immunohistochemically, hepatocellular carcinoma cells
stain positively with AFP, EMA, keratin etc.
FIBROLAMELLAR CARCINOMA. A clinicopathologic
variant of the HCC is fibrolamellar carcinoma of the liver
found in young people of both sexes. The tumour forms a

a single, large mass (arrow) with irregular borders and having central
areas of necrosis, while rest of the hepatic parenchyma in the upper part
of the picture shows many nodules of variable sizes owing to co-existent
macronodular cirrhosis.

636
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
single large mass which may be encapsulated and occurs in
the absence of cirrhosis.
Histologically, the tumour is composed of eosinophilic
polygonal cells (oncocytes) forming cords and nests which
are separated by bands of fibrous stroma (Fig. 21.36).
The prognosis of fibrolamellar carcinoma is better than
other forms of HCC.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Hepatic cancer may remain
undetected initially because it often occurs in patients with
underlying cirrhosis. The usual features consist of
hepatomegaly with palpable mass in the liver, right upper
quadrant pain or tenderness, and less often, jaundice, fever
and haemorrhage from oesophageal varices. Ascites with
RBCs and malignant cells is found in about half the patients.
Rarely, systemic endocrine manifestations due to paraneo-
plastic syndrome are eobsereved such as hypercalcaemia,
hypoglycaemia, gynaecomastia and acquired porphyria.
Laboratory findings yield nonspecific results like
anaemia, markedly elevated serum alkaline phosphatase as
found in cirrhosis, and high serum alpha-foetoprotein (AFP).
Elevated AFP level is quite specific; very high levels of AFP
(above 500 ng/ml) are observed in 70-80% cases of HCC but
lacks sensitivity since AFP is also found elevated in yolk sac
tumour, cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, massive liver necrosis
and normal pregnancy. Ultrasound of the liver has been
reported to be more sensitive than elevated AFP level. An
abnormal type of prothrombin, des-γ-carboxy prothrombin,
is also elevated and correlates well with AFP levels.
SPREAD. The HCC can have both intrahepatic and
extrahepatic spread which faithfully reproduces the structure
of the primary tumour:
Intrahepatic spread occurs by haematogenous route and
forms multiple metastases in the liver.
Extrahepatic spread occurs via hepatic or portal veins to
different sites, chiefly to lungs and bones, and by lymphatic
route to regional lymph nodes at the porta hepatis and to
mediastinal and cervical lymph nodes.
The causes of death from the HCC are cachexia, massive
bleeding from oesophageal varices, and liver failure with
hepatic coma.
Cholangiocarcinoma
Cholangiocarcinoma is the designation used for carcinoma
arising from bile duct epithelium within the liver (peripheral
cholangiocarcinoma). Carcinomas arising from the large hilar
ducts (hilar cholangiocarcinoma) and from extrahepatic ducts
are termed bile duct carcinomas (page 644). None of the
etiologic factors related to HCC have any role in the genesis
of cholangiocarcinoma. However, the etiological factors
involved in it are exposure to radio-opaque dye thorotrast,
anabolic steroids, clonorchiasis and fibrocystic disease. The
tumour affects older people and the clinical features are those
of HCC but with prominence of jaundice.

CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
firm to hard and whitish.
Microscopically, the tumour has glandular structure. The
tumour cells resemble biliary epithelium but without bile
secretion. They form various patterns such as tubular,
ductular or papillary. The stroma consists of fibrous tissue
with little or no capillary formation. Occasionally,
mucinous, signet-ring and adenosquamous type of
patterns are found. An uncommon variant is combined
hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma.
Hepatoblastoma (Embryoma)
Hepatoblastoma is a rare malignant tumour arising from
primitive hepatic parenchymal cells. It presents before the
age of 2 years as progressive abdominal distension with
anorexia, failure to thrive, fever and jaundice. It is more
common in boys. The concentration of serum AFP is high.
The tumour grows rapidly and causes death by
haemorrhage, hepatic failure or widespread metastases.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES, Grossly, the tumour is
circumscribed and lobulated mass measuring 5-25 cm in
size, having areas of cystic degeneration, haemorrhage
and necrosis.
Microscopically, hepatoblastoma consists of 2
components:
i)
Epithelial component contains 2 types of cells—
‘embryonal’ hepatocytes are small with dark-staining,
hyperchromatic nuclei and scanty cytoplasm, and ‘foetal’
hepatocytes are larger with more cytoplasm that may be
granular or clear. The epithelial cells are organised in
trabeculae, ribbons or rosettes.
ii) Mesenchymal component includes fibrous connective
tissue, cartilage and osteoid of variable degree of
maturation. Extramedullary haematopoiesis is a frequent
accompaniment.
Secondary Hepatic Tumours
Metastatic tumours in the liver are more common than the
primary hepatic tumours. Most frequently, they are blood-
borne metastases, irrespective of whether the primary
tumour is drained by portal vein or systemic veins. Most
frequent primary tumours metastasising to the liver, in
descending order of frequency, are those of stomach, breast,
lungs, colon, oesophagus, pancreas, malignant melanoma
and haematopoietic malignancies. Sarcomas rarely
metastasise to the liver. Occasionally, metastatic involvement
may be present in the absence of obvious evidence of primary
tumour. Aside from general features of disseminated
malignancy such as anorexia, cachexia and anaemia, the
patients have hepatomegaly with nodular free margin. There
is little hepatic dysfunction until late in the course of hepatic
metastatic disease.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, most metastatic
carcinomas form multiple, spherical, nodular masses
which are of variable size. Liver is enlarged and heavy,
weighing 5 kg or more. The tumour deposits are white,
well-demarcated, soft or haemorrhagic. The surface of the
liver shows characteristic umbilication due to central
necrosis of nodular masses (Fig. 21.37).
Histologically, the metastatic tumours generally
reproduce the structure of the primary lesions (Fig. 21.38).
Figure 21.37
Metastatic tumour deposits in the liver as seen on sectioned surface. Characteristic features include multiple, variable-sized,
nodular masses, often under the capsule, producing umbilication on the surface.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
BILIARY SYSTEM
NORMAL STRUCTURE
ANATOMY. The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ, 9 cm
in length and has a capacity of approximately 50 ml. It
consists of the fundus, body and neck that tapers into the cystic
duct. The two hepatic ducts from right and left lobes of the
liver unite at the porta hepatis to form the common hepatic
duct which is joined by the cystic duct from the gallbladder
to form the common bile duct. The common bile duct enters
the second part of the duodenum posteriorly. In about 70%
of cases, it is joined by the main pancreatic duct to form the
combined opening in the duodenum (ampulla of Vater). In
30% cases, the common bile duct and the pancreatic duct
open separately into the duodenum (see Fig. 21.1). The
common bile duct in its duodenal portion is surrounded by
longitudinal and circular muscles derived from the
duodenum forming sphincter of Oddi.
HISTOLOGY. Histologically, the gallbladder, unlike the rest
of gastrointestinal tract, lacks the muscularis mucosae and
submucosa. The wall of the gallbladder is composed of the
following 4 layers:
1.
Mucosal layer: It has a single layer of tall columnar
epithelium which is thrown into permanent folds that are
larger and more numerous in the neck of the gallbladder.
Beneath the epithelium is delicate lamina propria that
contains capillaries, and in the region of the neck, a few acinar
glands are present.
2.
Smooth muscle layer: External to the lamina propria are
smooth muscle bundles in layers—inner longitudinal, middle
oblique, and outer circular.
3.
Perimuscular layer: Outer to the muscle layer is a zone
of fibrous connective tissue with some interspersed fat cells.
4.
Perimuscular layer: The perimuscular layer is covered
by serosa on the peritoneal surface of the gallbladder. The
peritoneum covers the gallbladder except in the region of
gallbladder fossa where it is embedded in the liver.
The extrahepatic bile ducts are also lined by tall columnar
epithelium that overlies the lamina propria. It is surrounded
by dense layer of fibromuscular tissue. The ducts which lie
between the lobules of the liver and receive bile from the
canaliculi are lined by cuboidal or flattened cells.
FUNCTIONS. The main function of the gallbladder is to
store and concentrate the bile secreted by the liver and then
deliver it into the intestine for digestion and absorption of
fat. The concentrating ability of the gallbladder is due to its
absorptive mucosal surface that has numerous folds.
Normally, the liver secretes approximately 500 ml of bile per
day and the gallbladder concentrates it 5-10 times. The
motility, concentration and relaxation of the gallbladder are
under the influence of a peptide hormone, cholecystokinin,
released from neuroendocrine cells of the duodenum and
jejunum.
CONGENITAL ANOMALIES
Several uncommon congenital anomalies of the biliary
system have been described. These include: agenesis,
duplication and heterotopic tissue. However, congenital cystic
lesions of the bile ducts (as also of the liver) are more
frequently diagnosed. These conditions include: congenital
intrahepatic biliary dilatation (Caroli’s disease), choledochal
cysts, polycystic liver disease and congenital hepatic fibrosis.
They are found in various combinations and are usually
inherited. All of them may be complicated by malignant
change.
CHOLELITHIASIS (GALLSTONES)
Gallstones are formed from constituents of the bile (viz.
cholesterol, bile pigments and calcium salts) along with other
organic components. Accordingly, the gallstones commonly
contain cholesterol, bile pigment and calcium salts in varying
proportions. They are usually formed in the gallbladder, but
sometimes may develop within extrahepatic biliary passages,
and rarely in the larger intrahepatic bile duct.
RISK FACTORS. The incidence of gallstones varies
markedly in different geographic areas, age, gender, diet and
various other risk factors. These factors which largely pertain
to cholesterol stones can be summed up in the old saying
that gallstones are common in 4F’s acronym for—‘fat, female,
fertile (multipara) and forty’. Some of the risk factors in
lithogenesis are explained below:
1.
Geography. Gallstones are quite prevalent in almost the
entire Western world. American Indians have the highest
known prevalence. Black Africans and populations in the
Eastern world are relatively free of cholelithiasis.
2.
Genetic factors. There is increased frequency of gall-
stones in first-degree relatives of patients with cholelithiasis.
Patients of gallstones disease have increased secretion of
dietary cholesterol  in bile than in non-gallstone patients
inspite of high-cholesterol diet. Recently, mutation in
CYP7A1 gene has been found that results in deficiency of
enzyme, cholesterol 7-hydroxylase, which has a role in bile
acid synthesis. This mutation is associated with hypercholes-
terolaemia and gallstones.
3.
Age. There is steady increase in the prevalence of
gallstones with advancing age which may be related to
increased cholesterol content in the bile. The incidence
increases above the age of 40 and presentation is usually in
the 50s and 60s.
4.
Sex. Gallstones are twice more frequent in women than
in men. In the United States, autopsy series have shown
gallstones in about 20% of women and 8% of men above the
age of 40. The incidence is higher in multiparous women
than in nulliparous women.
5.
Drugs. Women on oestrogen therapy or on birth control
pills have higher incidence of gallstones. This is considered
to be due to production of more lithogenic bile as a result of
cholestatic effect of oestrogen. Similar is the influence of
clofibrate used for lowering blood cholesterol.
6.
Obesity. Obesity is associated with increased cholesterol
synthesis and its excretion resulting in higher incidence of
gallstones in obese patients.
7.
Diet. Deficiency of dietary fibre content is linked to higher
prevalence of gallstones. A moderate consumption of alcohol,
however, seems to protect against gallstones.

639
CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
8.
Gastrointestinal diseases. Certain gastrointestinal
disorders such as Crohn’s disease, ileal resection, ileal bypass
surgery etc are associated with interruption in enterohepatic
circulation followed by gallstone formation.
9.
Factors in pigment gallstones. All the above factors apply
largely to cholesterol stones. Pigment stones, whether pure
or mixed type, are more frequently associated with
haemolytic anaemias which lead to increased content of
unconjugated bilirubin in the bile. Pigment stones are also
more frequent in cirrhosis and hepatocellular disease.
PATHOGENESIS. The mechanism of gallstone formation
(i.e. lithogenesis) is explained separately below under 2
headings: firstly for cholesterol, mixed gallstones and biliary
sludge; and, secondly  for pigment gallstones as under:
PATHOGENESIS OF CHOLESTEROL, MIXED GALL-
STONES AND BILIARY SLUDGE. Cholesterol is essentially
insoluble in water and can be solublised by another lipid.
Normally, cholesterol and phospholipids (lecithin) are
secreted into bile as ‘bilayered vesicles’ but are converted
into ‘mixed miscelles’ by addition of bile acids, the third
constituent. If there is excess of cholesterol compared to the
other two constituents, unstable cholesterol-rich vesicles
remain behind which aggregate and form cholesterol
crystals. Formation of such lithogenic (stone-forming) bile
is explained by the following mechanisms (Fig. 21.39):
1.
Supersaturation of bile: Several etiologic factors listed
above favour increased secretion of cholesterol in the
presence of normal bile acids and lecithin in the bile as the
major mechanism for initiation of gallstone formation. These
factors cause enhanced activity of enzyme, HMG-CoA
reductase, that normally regulates cholesterol synthesis and
its hepatic uptake. Two other disturbances which may
contribute to supersaturation of the bile with cholesterol are
as under:
i) Reduced bile acid pool: This causes rapid loss of the available
bile acids into the small intestine and then into the colon,
resulting in supersaturation of the bile with cholesterol.
ii) Increased conversion of cholic acid to deoxycholic acid: This
causes increased secretion of deoxycholate in the bile which
is associated with hypersecretion of cholesterol into the bile.
Mutation in MDR3 gene has been found that causes
defect in phospholipid secretion from bile, resulting in
cholesterol supersaturation of bile and cholesterol gallstone
formation. Although supersaturation of the bile with
cholesterol is an important pre-requisite for lithogenesis, this
in itself is not sufficient for cholesterol precipitation.
2.
Cholesterol nucleation. Initiation of cholesterol stones
occurs by nucleation of cholesterol monohydrate crystals.
Accelerated nucleation of cholesterol monohydrate may
occur either from pro-nucleating factors or from deficiency
of anti-nucleating factors:
i) Pro-nucleating factors are mucin and non-mucin
glycoproteins secreted by epithelial cells of the gallbladder.
 ii) Anti-nucleating factors are apolipoproteins AI and AII, and
some glycoproteins.
Cholesterol monohydrate nucleation probably occurs in
the mucin gel layer of the gallbladder followed by continued
addition and precipitation of more crystals resulting in solid
state crystals.
3.
Gallbladder hypomotility. Normally, the gallbladder is
capable of emptying and clearing any sludge or debris which
might initiate stone formation. This takes place under the
influence of cholecystokinin secreted from small intestine.
However, the motility of gallbladder may be impaired due
to decrease in cholecystokinin receptors in the gallbladder
resulting in stasis of biliary sludge and lithogenesis. A defect
in gallbladder emptying has been found to play a role in
recurrence of gall-stone formation in patients who undergo
biliary lithotripsy.
PATHOGENESIS OF PIGMENT GALLSTONES. The
mechanism of pigment stone formation is explained on the
basis of following factors:
i) Chronic haemolysis resulting in increased level of
unconjugated bilirubin in the bile.
ii) Alcoholic cirrhosis.
iii) Chronic biliary tract infection e.g. by parasitic infestations
of the biliary tract such as by Clonorchis sinensis and Ascaris
lumbricoides.
iv) Demographic and genetic factors e.g. in rural setting and
prevalence in Asian countries.
TYPES OF GALLSTONES. As stated before, gallstones
contain cholesterol, bile pigment and calcium carbonate,
either in pure form or in various combinations. Accordingly,
gallstones are of 3 major types—pure gallstones, mixed
gallstones and combined gallstones. Mixed gallstones are the
Figure 21.39

CoAR = hydroxy methyl glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase; 7α-OHase =

associated protein 3).

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
most common (80%) while pure and combined gallstones
comprise 10% each. In general, gallstones are formed most
frequently in the gallbladder but may occur in extrahepatic
as well as intrahepatic biliary passages. Gallbladder
containing pure stones shows no significant inflammatory
reaction, whereas chronic cholecystitis is invariably present
in gallbladder with either mixed or combined gallstones.
Presence of calcium salts renders gallstones radio-opaque,
while cholesterol stones appear as radiolucent filling defects
in the gallbladder.
The salient features of various types of gallstones are
summarised in Table 21.12 and presented below:
1.
Pure gallstones. They constitute about 10% of all
gallstones. They are further divided into 3 types according
to the component of bile forming them. These are as under
(Fig. 21.40):
i)
Pure cholesterol gallstones: They are usually solitary, oval
and fairly large (3 cm or more) filling the gallbladder. Their
surface is hard, smooth, whitish-yellow and glistening. On
cut section, the pure cholesterol stone shows radiating
glistening crystals. It may result in deposition of cholesterol
within the mucosal macrophages of the gallbladder
producing cholesterolosis which is an asymptomatic condition
(Fig. 21.41). Pure cholesterol stones are radiolucent but 10-
20% of them have calcium carbonate in them which renders
them opaque.
ii) Pure pigment gallstones: These stones composed primarily
of bile pigment, calcium bilirubinate, and contain less than
20% cholesterol. They are generally multiple, jet-black and
small (less than 1 cm in diameter). They have mulberry like
external surface. They are soft and can be easily crushed.
The gallbladder usually appears uninvolved.
iii) Pure calcium carbonate gallstones: They are rare. Calcium
carbonate gallstones are usually multiple, grey-white, small
(less than 1 cm in diameter), faceted and fairly hard due to
calcium content. They, too, do not produce any change in
the gallbladder wall.
2.
Mixed gallstones. Mixed gallstones are the most common
(80%) and contain more than 50% cholesterol monohydarate
plus an admixture of calcium salts, bile pigments and fatty
acids. They are always multiple, multifaceted so that they
fit together and vary in size from as tiny as sand-grain to 1
cm or more in diameter. On section, they have distinct
laminated structure with alternating dark pigment layer and
pale-white layer revealing different combinations of
cholesterol, bilirubin pigment and calcium carbonate, laid
down in layers at different times (Fig. 21.42, A).
Mixed gallstones are invariably accompanied by chronic
cholecystitis.
3.
Combined gallstones. They comprise about 10% of all
gallstones. Combined gallstones are usually solitary, large
and smooth-surfaced. It has a pure gallstone nucleus
(cholesterol, bile pigment or calcium carbonate) and outer
shell of mixed gallstone; or a mixed gallstone nucleus with pure
gallstone shell (Fig. 21.42, B).
Combined gallstones, too, are associated with chronic
cholecystitis.
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND COMPLICA-
TIONS. In about 50% cases, gallstones cause no symptoms
and may be diagnosed by chance during investigations for
some other condition (silent gallstones). The future course in
such asymptomatic silent cases is controversial, most
surgeons advocating cholecystectomy while physicians
advising watchful waiting. Follow-up studies, however,
show that only about 10% of such cases develop symptoms.
Symptomatic gallstone disease appears only when
complications develop. These are as under:
1.
Cholecystitis. The relationship between cholelithiasis and
cholecystitis is well known but it is not certain which of the
two comes first. The patients with gallstones develop
symptoms due to cholecystitis which include typical biliary
colic precipitated by fatty meal, nausea, vomiting, fever
alongwith leucocytosis and high serum bilirubin.
2.
Choledocholithiasis. Gallstones may pass down into the
extrahepatic biliary passages and the small bowel, or less
often they may be formed in the biliary tree. Patients with
gallstone in the common bile duct frequently develop pain
and obstructive jaundice. Fever may develop due to bacterial
ascending cholangitis.

3.
Mucocele. Mucocele or hydrops of the gallbladder is
distension of the gallbladder by clear, watery mucinous
secretion resulting from impacted stones in the neck of the
gallbladder.
4.
Biliary fistula. An uncommon complication of
cholelithiasis is formation of fistulae between one part of the
biliary system and the bowel, and rarely between the
gallbladder and the skin.
5.
Gallstone ileus. A gallstone in the intestine may be
passed in the faeces without causing symptoms.
Occasionally, however, gallstones in the intestine may cause
intestinal obstruction called gallstone ileus.
6.
Gallbladder cancer. There is a small and doubtful risk
of development of cancer of the gallbladder in cases with
cholelithiasis (page 643).
CHOLECYSTITIS
Cholecystitis or inflammation of the gallbladder may be
acute, chronic, or acute superimposed on chronic. Though
chronic cholecystitis is more common, acute cholecystitis is
a surgical emergency.
Acute Cholecystitis
In many ways, acute cholecystitis is similar to acute appen-
dicitis. The condition usually begins with obstruction,
followed by infection later.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Based on the initiating mechanisms,
acute cholecystitis occurs in two types of situations—acute
calculous and acute acalculous cholecystitis.
Acute calculous cholecystitis. In 90% of cases, acute
cholecystitis is caused by obstruction in the neck of the
gallbladder or in the cystic duct by a gallstone. The commo-
nest location of impaction of a gallstone is in Hartmann’s
pouch. Obstruction results in distension of the gallbladder
followed by acute inflammation which is initially due to
chemical irritation. Later, however, secondary bacterial
infection, chiefly by E. coli and Streptococcus faecalis,
supervenes.
Acute acalculous cholecystitis. The remaining 10% cases
of acute cholecystitis do not contain gallstones. In such cases,
a variety of causes have been assigned such as previous
nonbiliary surgery, multiple injuries, burns, recent childbirth,
severe sepsis, dehydration, torsion of the gallbladder and
diabetes mellitus. Rare causes include primary bacterial
infection like salmonellosis and cholera and parasitic
infestations.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Except for the presence or
absence of calculi, the two forms of acute cholecystitis are
morphologically similar.
Grossly, the gallbladder is distended and tense. The
serosal surface is coated with fibrinous exudate with
congestion and haemorrhages. The mucosa is bright red.
The lumen is filled with pus mixed with green bile. In
calculous cholecystitis, a stone is generally impacted in
the neck or in the cystic duct. When obstruction of the

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
cystic duct is complete, the lumen is filled with purulent
exudate and the condition is known as empyema of the
gallbladder.
Microscopically, wall of the gallbladder shows marked
inflammatory oedema, congestion and neutrophilic
exudate. There may be frank abscesses in the wall and
gangrenous necrosis with rupture into the peritoneal
cavity (gangrenous cholecystitis).
CLINICAL FEATURES. The patients of acute cholecystitis
of either type have similar clinical features. They present with
severe pain in the upper abdomen with features of peritoneal
irritation such as guarding and hyperaesthesia. The
gallbladder is tender and may be palpable. Fever,
leucocytosis with neutrophilia and slight jaundice are
generally present. Early cholecystectomy within the first
three days has a mortality of less than 0.5% and risk of
complications such as perforation, biliary fistula, recurrent
attacks and adhesions is avoided. However, medical
treatment brings about resolution in a fairly large proportion
of cases though chances of recurrence of attack persist.
Chronic Cholecystitis
Chronic cholecystitis is the commonest type of clinical
gallbladder disease. There is almost constant association of
chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The association of chronic
cholecystitis with mixed and combined gallstones is virtually
always present. However, it is not known what initiates the
inflammatory response in the gallbladder wall. Possibly,
supersaturation of the bile with cholesterol predisposes to
both gallstone formation and inflammation. In some patients,
repeated attacks of mild acute cholecystitis result in chronic
cholecystitis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the gallbladder
is generally contracted but may be normal or enlarged
(Fig. 21.43). The wall of the gallbladder is thickened which
on cut section is grey-white due to dense fibrosis or may
be even calcified. The mucosal folds may be intact,
thickened, or flattened and atrophied. The lumen
commonly contains multiple mixed stones or a combined
stone.
Histologically, the features are as under (Fig. 21.44):
1.
Thickened and congested mucosa but occasionally
mucosa may be totally destroyed.
2.
Penetration of the mucosa deep into the wall of the
gallbladder up to muscularis layer to form Rokitansky-
Aschoff’sinuses.
3.
Variable degree of chronic inflammatory reaction,
consisting of lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages,
present in the lamina propria and subserosal layer.
4.
Variable degree of fibrosis in the subserosal and
subepithelial layers.
A few morphologic variants of chronic cholecystitis
are considered below:
Cholecystitis glandularis, when the mucosal folds
fuse together due to inflammation and result in formation
of crypts of epithelium buried in the gallbladder wall.
Porcelain gallbladder is the pattern when the
gallbladder wall is calcified and cracks like an egg-shell.
Acute on chronic cholecystitis is the term used for
the morphologic changes of acute cholecystitis
superimposed on changes of chronic cholecystitis.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Chronic cholecystitis has ill-defined
and vague symptoms. Generally, the patient—a fat, fertile,
female of forty or fifty, presents with abdominal distension or
epigastric discomfort, especially after a fatty meal. There is
Figure 21.43

a constant dullache in the right hypochondrium and
epigastrium and tenderness over the right upper abdomen.
Nausea and flatulence are common. Biliary colic may
occasionally occur due to passage of stone into the bile ducts.
Cholecystography usually allows radiologic visualisation of
the gallstones.
TUMOURS OF BILIARY SYSTEM
BENIGN TUMOURS
Benign tumours such as papilloma, adenoma, adenomyoma,
fibroma, lipoma, myxoma, and haemangioma have been
described in the biliary tract but all of them are exceedingly
rare. Adenomyoma is more common benign tumour than the
rest. All these tumours resemble their counterparts in
morphology elsewhere in the body.
MALIGNANT TUMOURS
Carcinoma of the gallbladder and carcinoma of the bile ducts
and ampulla of Vater are among the more frequent malignant
tumours of the biliary tract.
Carcinoma of the Gallbladder
Primary carcinoma of the gallbladder is more prevalent than
other cancers of the extrahepatic biliary tract. Like
cholelithiasis and cholecystitis, it is more frequent in women
than in men (ratio 4:1) with a peak incidence in 7th decade
of life. It may remain undetected until the time it is widely
spread and rendered inoperable.
ETIOLOGY. A number of etiologic factors have been
implicated.
1.
Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. The most significant
association of cancer of the gallbladder is with cholelithiasis
and cholecystitis, though there is no definite evidence of
causal relationship. Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis are
present in about 75% cases of gallbladder cancer. On the other
hand, incidence of documented gallbladder cancer in the
presence of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis is about 0.5% only.
Porcelain gallbladdder is particularly likely to become
cancerous.
2.
Chemical carcinogens. A number of chemical
carcinogens structurally similar to naturally-occurring bile
acids have been considered to induce gallbladder cancer.
These include methyl cholanthrene, various nitrosamines
and pesticides. Workers engaged in rubber industry have
higher incidence of gallbladder cancer.
3.
Genetic factors. There is higher incidence of cancer of
the gallbladder in certain populations living in the same
geographic region suggesting a strong genetic component
in the disease. Japanese immigrants and Native Americans
of the South-Western America have increased frequency
while American Indians and Mexicans have lower incidence.
4.
Miscellaneous. Patients who have undergone previous
surgery on the biliary tract have higher incidence of
subsequent gallbladder cancer. Patients with inflammatory
bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease) have
high incidence of gallbladder cancer.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The commonest site is the
fundus, followed next in frequency by the neck of the
gallbladder (Fig. 21.45).
Grossly, cancer of the gallbladder is of 2 types—infil-
trating and fungating type (Fig. 21.46):
Figure 21.44
Chronic cholecystitis, microscopic appearance. There is penetration of epithelium-lined spaces into the gallbladder wall (Rokitansky-
Aschoff sinus) in an area. There is subepithelial and subserosal fibrosis and hypertrophy of muscularis. Mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate is
present in subepithelial and perimuscular layers.

644
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
1.
Infiltrating type appears as an irregular area of diffuse
thickening and induration of the gallbladder wall. It may
have deep ulceration causing direct invasion of the
gallbladder wall and liver bed. On section, the gallbladder
wall is firm due to scirrhous growth.
2.
Fungating type grows like an irregular, friable,
papillary or cauliflower-like growth into the lumen as well
as into the wall of the gallbladder and beyond.
Histologically, the following patterns are observed:
1.
Most gallbladder cancers are adenocarcinomas (90%).
They may be papillary or infiltrative, well-differentiated
or poorly-differentiated. Most are non-mucin secreting but
some are colloid carcinomas forming mucus pools.
2.
About 5% of gallbladder cancers are squamous cell
carcinomas arising from squamous metaplastic epithelium.
3.
A few cases show both squamous and adeno-
carcinoma pattern of growth called adenosquamous
carcinoma.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Carcinoma of the gallbadder is
slow-growing and causes symptoms late in the course of
disease. Quite often, the diagnosis is made when gallbladder
is removed for cholelithiasis. The symptomatic cases have
pain, jaundice, noticeable mass, anorexia and weight loss.
In such case, the growth has usually invaded the liver and
other adjacent organs and has metastasised to regional lymph
nodes and more distant sites such as the lung, peritoneum
and gastrointestinal tract.
Carcinoma of Extrahepatic Bile Ducts and
Ampulla of Vater
This is an infrequent neoplasm but is more common than
the rare benign tumours of the biliary tract. Unlike other
diseases of the biliary passages, it is more common in males
with peak incidence in 6th decade of life.
ETIOLOGY. There is no association between bile duct
carcinoma and gallstones. Bile duct cancers are associated
with a number of other conditions such as ulcerative colitis,
sclerosing cholangitis, parasitic infestations of the bile ducts
with Fasciola hepatica (liver fluke), Ascaris lumbricoides and
Clonorchis sinensis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Extrahepatic bile duct
carcinoma may arise anywhere in the biliary tree but the
most frequent sites, in descending order of frequency, are:
the ampulla of Vater, lower end of common bile duct,
hepatic ducts, and the junction of hepatic ducts to form
common bile duct (see Fig. 21.45).
Grossly, bile duct carcinoma is usually small, extending
for 1-2 cm along the duct, producing thickening of the
affected duct.
Histologically, the tumour is usually well-differentiated
adenocarcinoma which may or may not be mucin-
secreting. Perineural invasion is frequently present.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Obstructive jaundice is the usual
presenting feature which is characterised by intense pruritus.
Pain, steatorrhoea, weight loss and weakness may be present.
The tumour usually metastasises to the regional lymph
nodes.
EXOCRINE PANCREAS
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The human pancreas, though anatomically a single organ,
histologically and physiologically has 2 distinct parts—the

645
CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
exocrine and endocrine parts. The endocrine part of the gland
is dealt with in Chapter 27 while the exocrine gland is
considered here. The whole of pancreas, exocrine and
endocrine, is embryologically derived from the foregut
endoderm.
ANATOMY. The pancreas lies obliquely in the concavity of
the duodenum as an elongated structure about 15 cm in
length and 100 gm in weight (see Fig. 21.1). It is subdivided
into 3 topographic zones:
1.
The head lying in the concavity of the duodenum and the
uncinate process projecting from the head.
2.
The body comprises the main part of the gland.
3.
The tail is the thin, tapering part of the gland towards
the hilum of the spleen.
HISTOLOGY. The exocrine pancreas constitutes 80 to 85%
of the total gland, while the endocrine pancreas comprises
the remaining part.
The exocrine part is divided into rhomboid lobules
separated by thin fibrous tissue septa containing blood
vessels, lymphatics, nerves and ducts. Each lobule is
composed of numerous acini. The acini are lined by pyramid-
shaped columnar epithelial cells. These secretory epithelial
cells have microvilli projecting into the lumen from their
surface. The apical portions of these cells contain zymogen
granules in their cytoplasm, while the basal region is deeply
basophilic and free of zymogen granules. The zymogen
granules are membrane-bound sacs which fuse with the
plasma membrane and are then released into the lumina of
the acini. The secretions are carried from the acini by fine
ductal branches into the small ducts in the lobules and
eventually into the main pancreatic duct. The main
pancreatic duct is formed by fusion of the ventral duct with
the dorsal duct; the latter also called the duct of Wirsung,
provides the main drainage for pancreatic secretions into the
duodenum. The pancreatic secretions are delivered into the
second part of the duodenum either by a combined opening
of the pancreatic and bile ducts in the ampulla of Vater, or
less often both open separately into the duodenum.
Occasionally, the proximal part of the dorsal duct persists
as the duct of Santorini.
FUNCTIONS. The main functions of the exocrine pancreas
is the alkaline secretion of digestive enzymes prominent
among which are trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, amylase,
lipase and phospholipase.
DEVELOPMENTAL ANOMALIES
The significant developmental anomalies of the pancreas are
ectopic or aberrant pancreatic tissue in Meckel’s diverticulum
(page 561), anomalies of the ducts, and cystic fibrosis. Only
the last named requires elaboration here.
Cystic Fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis of the pancreas or fibrocystic disease is a
hereditary disorder characterised by viscid mucous
secretions in all the exocrine glands of the body (muco-
viscidosis) and associated with increased concentrations of
electrolytes in the eccrine glands. The terms ‘cystic fibrosis’
and ‘fibrocystic disease’ are preferable over ‘mucoviscidosis’
in view of the main pathologic change of fibrosis produced
as a result of obstruction of the passages by viscid mucous
secretions.
The disease is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait
with apparent clinical features in homozygotes only. The
defect is a genetic mutation in CFTR gene, acronym for
coding protein for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator located on chromosome 7. It is quite common in
the whites (1 per 2000 livebirths). The clinical manifestations
may appear at birth or later in adolescence and pertain to
multiple organs and systems such as pancreatic insufficiency,
intestinal obstruction, steatorrhoea, malnutrition, hepatic
cirrhosis and respiratory complications.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Depending upon the
severity of involvement and the organs affected, the
pathologic changes are variable. Most of the changes are
produced as a result of obstruction by viscid mucous.
1.
Pancreas. The pancreas is almost invariably involved
in cystic fibrosis.
Grossly, pancreatic lobules are ovoid rather than
rhomboid. Fatty replacement of the pancreas and grossly
visible cysts may be seen.
Microscopically, the lobular architecture of pancreatic
parenchyma is maintained. There is increased interlobular
fibrosis. The acini are atrophic and many of the acinar
ducts contain laminated, eosinophilic concretions. Rarely,
inflammation, fat necrosis and cyst formation may be seen.
The islet tissue (endocrine pancreas) generally remains
intact. Atrophy of the exocrine pancreas may cause
impaired fat absorption, steatorrhoea, intestinal
obstruction and avitaminosis A.
2.
Liver. The bile canaliculi are plugged by viscid
mucous which may cause diffuse fatty change, portal
fibrosis and ductular proliferation. More severe involve-
ment may cause biliary cirrhosis (page 625).
3.
Respiratory tract. Changes in the respiratory passages
are seen in almost all typical cases of cystic fibrosis. The
viscid mucous secretions of the submucosal glands of the
respiratory tract cause obstruction, dilatation and infection
of the airways. The changes include chronic bronchitis,
bronchiectasis, 
bronchiolitis, 
bronchiolectasis,
peribronchiolar pneumonia and inflammatory nasal
polyps.
4.
Salivary glands. Pathologic changes in the salivary
glands are similar to those in pancreas and include
obstruction of the ducts, dilatation, fibrosis and glandular
atrophy.
5.
Sweat glands. Hypersecretion of sodium and chloride
in the sweat observed in these patients may be reflected
pathologically by diminished vacuolation of the cells of
eccrine glands.

646
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
PANCREATITIS
Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas with acinic cell
injury. It is classified into acute and chronic forms both of
which are distinct entities.
Acute Pancreatitis
Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammation of the pancreas
presenting clinically with ‘acute abdomen’. The severe form
of the disease associated with macroscopic haemorrhages
and fat necrosis in and around the pancreas is termed acute
haemorrhagic pancreatitis or acute pancreatic necrosis. The
condition occurs in adults between the age of 40 and 70 years
and is commoner in females than in males.
The onset of acute pancreatitis is sudden, occurring after
a bout of alcohol or a heavy meal. The patient presents with
abdominal pain, vomiting and collapse and the condition
must be differentiated from other diseases producing acute
abdomen such as acute appendicitis, perforated peptic ulcer,
acute cholecystitis, and infarction of the intestine following
sudden occlusion of the mesenteric vessels. Characteri-
stically, there is elevation of serum amylase level within the
first 24 hours and elevated serum lipase level after 3 to 4 days,
the latter being more specific for pancreatic disease.
Glucosuria occurs in 10% of cases.
ETIOLOGY. The two leading causes associated with acute
pancreatitis are alcoholism and cholelithiasis, both of which
are implicated in more than 80% of cases. Less common
causes of acute pancreatitis include trauma, ischaemia, shock,
extension of inflammation from the adjacent tissues, blood-
borne bacterial infection, viral infections, certain drugs (e.g.
thiazides, sulfonamides, oral contraceptives), hypothermia,
hyperlipoproteinaemia and hypercalcaemia from hyperpara-
thyroidism. Rarely, familial pancreatitis is encountered. In a
proportion of cases of acute pancreatitis, the etiology remains
unknown (idiopathic pancreatitis).
PATHOGENESIS. The destructive changes in the pancreas
are attributed to the liberation and activation of pancreatic
enzymes. Though more than 20 enzymes are secreted by
exocrine pancreas, 3 main groups of enzymes which bring
about destructive effects on the pancreas are as under:
1.
Proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin play the most
important role in causing proteolysis. Trypsin also activates
the kinin system by converting prekallikrein to kallikrein,
and thereby the clotting and complement systems are
activated. This results in inflammation, thrombosis, tissue
damage and haemorrhages found in acute haemorrhagic
pancreatitis.
2.
Lipases and phospholipases degrade lipids and membrane
phospholipids.
3.
Elastases cause destruction of the elastic tissue of the blood
vessels.
The activation and release of these enzymes is brought
about by one of the following mechanisms:
Acinic cell damage caused by the etiologic factors such as
alcohol, viruses, drugs, ischaemia and trauma result in
release of intracellular enzymes.
Duct obstruction caused by cholelithiasis, chronic
alcoholism and other obstructing lesions is followed by
leakage of pancreatic enzymes from the ductules into the
interstitial tissue.
Block in exocytosis of pancreatic enzymes occurring from
nutritional causes results in activation of these intracellular
enzymes by pancreatic lysosomal hydrolases.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, in the early stage,
the pancreas is swollen and oedematous. Subsequently,
in a day or two, characteristic variegated appearance of
grey-white pancreatic necrosis, chalky-white fat necrosis
and blue-black haemorrhages are seen. In typical case, the
peritoneal cavity contains blood-stained ascitic fluid and
white flecks of fat necrosis in the omentum, mesentery
and peripancreatic tissue. The resolved lesions show areas
of fibrosis, calcification and ductal dilatation.
Microscopically, the following features in varying grades
are noticeable:
1.
Necrosis of pancreatic lobules and ducts.
2.
Necrosis of the arteries and arterioles with areas of
haemorrhages.
3.
Fat necrosis.
4.
Inflammatory reaction, chiefly by polymorphs, around
the areas of necrosis and haemorrhages.
COMPLICATIONS. A patient of acute pancreatitis who
survives may develop a variety of systemic and local
complications.
Systemic complications:
1.
Chemical and bacterial peritonitis.
2.
Endotoxic shock.
3.
Acute renal failure.
Local sequelae:
1.
Pancreatic abscess.
2.
Pancreatic pseudocyst.
3.
Duodenal obstruction.
Mortality in acute pancreatitis is high (20-30%). Patients
succumb to hypotensive shock, infection, acute renal failure,
and DIC.
Chronic Pancreatitis
Chronic pancreatitis or chronic relapsing pancreatitis is the
progressive destruction of the pancreas due to repeated mild
and subclinical attacks of acute pancreatitis. Most patients
present with recurrent attacks of severe abdominal pain at
intervals of months to years. Weight loss and jaundice are
often associated. Later manifestations include associated
diabetes mellitus and steatorrhoea. Abdominal radiographs
show calcification in the region of pancreas and presence of
pancreatic calculi in the ducts.
ETIOLOGY. Most cases of chronic pancreatitis are caused
by the same factors as for acute pancreatitis. Thus, most
commonly, chronic pancreatitis is related to chronic alcoholism
with protein-rich diet, and less often to biliary tract disease.
Familial hereditary pancreatitis, though uncommon, is more
frequently chronic than the acute form. Other rare causes of
chronic pancreatitis are hypercalcaemia, hyperlipidaemia

647
CHAPTER 21
The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas
and developmental failure of fusion of dorsal and ventral
pancreatic ducts.
PATHOGENESIS. Acute haemorrhagic pancreatitis seldom
develops into chronic pancreatitis, but instead develops
pancreatic pseudocysts following recovery. Pathogenesis of
alcoholic and non-alcoholic chronic pancreatitis is explained
by different mechanisms:
1.
Chronic pancreatitis due to chronic alcoholism accom-
panied by a high-protein diet results in increase in protein
concentration in the pancreatic juice which obstructs the
ducts and causes damage.
2. Non-alcoholic cases of chronic pancreatitis seen in
tropical countries (tropical chronic pancreatitis) result from
protein-calorie malnutrition. Genetic factors play a role in
some cases of chronic pancreatitis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the pancreas is
enlarged, firm and nodular. The cut surface shows a
smooth grey appearance with loss of normal lobulation.
Foci of calcification and tiny pancreatic concretions to
larger visible stones are frequently found. Pseudocysts
may be present.
Microscopically, depending upon the stage of
development, the following changes are seen (Fig. 21.47):
1.
Obstruction of the ducts by fibrosis in the wall and
protein plugs or stones in the lumina.
2.
Squamous metaplasia and dilatation of some inter-
and intralobular ducts.
3.
Chronic inflammatory infiltrate around the lobules as
well as the ducts.
4.
Atrophy of the acinar tissue with marked increase in
interlobular fibrous tissue.
5.
Islet tissue is involved in late stage only.
COMPLICATIONS. Late stage of chronic pancreatitis may
be complicated by diabetes mellitus, pancreatic insufficiency
with steatorrhoea and malabsorption and formation of
pancreatic pseudocysts (Fig. 21.48).
TUMOURS AND TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS
Tumour-like masses of the exocrine pancreas include
congenital cystic disease (involving the pancreas, liver and
kidney) and pancreatic pseudocysts. True pancreatic tumours
are classified into benign (e.g. serous cystadenoma, fibroma,
lipoma and adenoma) and malignant (i.e. carcinoma of the
pancreas). Out of all these, only two pancreatic lesions—
pseudocyst and carcinoma of the pancreas, are common and
are discussed below.
Pancreatic Pseudocyst
Pancreatic pseudocyst is a localised collection of pancreatic
juice, necrotic debris and haemorrhages. It develops
following either acute pancreatitis or trauma. The patients
generally present with abdominal mass producing pain,
intraperitoneal haemorrhage and generalised peritonitis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the pseudocyst
may be present within or adjacent to the pancreas. Usually
it is solitary, unilocular, measuring up to 10 cm in
diameter with thin or thick wall (Fig. 21.48).
Microscopically, the cyst wall is composed of dense
fibrous tissue with marked inflammatory reaction. There
is evidence of preceding haemorrhage and necrosis in the
form of deposits of haemosiderin pigment, calcium and
cholesterol crystals. The lumen of the cyst contains serous
or turbid fluid. The cyst does not show any epithelial
lining.
Carcinoma of Pancreas
Pancreatic cancer is the term used for cancer of the exocrine
pancreas. It is one of the common cancers, particularly in
the Western countries and Japan. In the United States, cancer
of the pancreas is the second most common cancer of the
alimentary tract after colorectal cancer, is more common in
Figure 21.47
Chronic pancreatitis. There is destruction of acinar
tissue and presence of dystrophic calcification. The necrotic tissue is
surrounded by mixed inflammatory infiltrate with granulation tissue
formation.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
African Americans and accounts for 5% of all cancer deaths
in that country. It is commoner in males than in females and
the incidence increases progressively after the age of 50 years.
ETIOLOGY.  A significant increase in the incidence of
pancreatic cancer has been observed in the UK and US during
the last 50 years. Little is known about etiology of pancreatic
cancer.  However, following factors have been implicated in
its etiology:
1.
Smoking: Heavy cigarette smokers have higher incidence
than the non-smokers. However, it is not known whether
tobacco metabolites have a direct carcinogenic effect on the
pancreas or by some other unknown mechanism.
2.
Diet and obesity: Diet with high total caloric value and
high consumption of animal proteins and fats is related to
higher incidence of pancreatic cancer. Obesity is a risk factor
for pancreatic cancer.
3.
Chemical carcinogens: Individuals exposed to β-naph-
thylamine, benzidine and nitrosamines have higher incidence
of cancer of the pancreas.
4.
Diabetes mellitus: Patients of long-standing diabetes
mellitus have a higher incidence.
5.
Chronic pancreatitis patients are at increased risk.
6. H. pylori infection has been reported to have association
with pancreatic cancer.
7. Genetic factors have been ound to have association with
pancreatic cancer e.g. its occurrence in first-degree relatives
in 10% cases, occurrence in certain hereditary syndromes
(Lynch, FPC, HNPCC).
However, excessive consumption of alcohol or coffee, and
cholelithiasis are not risk factors for pancreatic cancer. A
combination of mutations in K-RAS gene and CDKN2A gene
have been found in almost all cases of cancer of the pancreas.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The most common loca-
tion of pancreatic cancer is the head of pancreas (70%),
followed in decreasing frequency, by the body and the
tail of pancreas (Fig. 21.49).
Grossly, carcinoma of the head of pancreas is generally
small, homogeneous, poorly-defined, grey-white mass
without any sharp demarcation between the tumour and
the surrounding pancreatic parenchyma. The tumour of
the head extends into the ampulla of Vater, common bile
duct and duodenum, producing obstructive biliary
symptoms and jaundice early in the course of illness.
Carcinomas of the body and tail of the pancreas, on the
other hand, are fairly large and irregular masses and
frequently infiltrate the transverse colon, stomach, liver,
spleen and regional lymph nodes.
Microscopically, most pancreatic carcinomas arise from
the ductal epithelium which normally comprises less than
4% of total pancreatic cells, whereas carcinoma of the acini
Figure 21.49
Distribution of carcinoma of the pancreas (numbered
serially) and its major effects.
constitutes less than 1% of pancreatic cancers. The
following histologic patterns of pancreatic carcinoma are
seen:
1.
Well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, both mucinous and
non-mucin secreting type, is the most common pattern.
Perineural invasion is commonly present and is diagnostic
of malignancy.
2.
Adenoacanthoma consisting of glandular carcinoma and
benign squamous elements is seen in a proportion of cases.
3.
Rarely, peculiar tumour giant cell formation is seen with
marked anaplasia, pleomorphism and numerous mitoses.
4
Acinar cell carcinoma occurs rarely and reproduces the
pattern of acini in normal pancreas.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Clinical symptoms depend upon
the site of origin of the tumour. Generally, the following
features are present:
1.
Obstructive jaundice. more often and early in the course
of disease in cases with carcinoma head of the pancreas (80%),
and less often in cancer of the body and tail of the pancreas.
It is characterised by: dark urine, clay-like stools, pruritus,
and very high serum alkaline phosphatase.
2.
Other features. These include: abdominal pain, anorexia,
weight loss, cachexia, weakness and malaise, nausea and
vomiting, and migratory thrombophlebitis (Trousseau’s
syndrome), GI bleeding and splenomegaly.
The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is dismal: median
survival is 6 months from the time of diagnosis.  Approxi-
mately 10% patients survive 1 year and the 5-year survival
is poor 1 to 2%.

KIDNEY
NORMAL STRUCTURE
ANATOMY. The kidneys are bean-shaped paired organs,
each weighing about 150 gm in the adult male and about
135 gm in the adult female. The hilum of the kidney is
situated at the midpoint on the medial aspect where the
artery, vein, lymphatics and ureter are located. The kidney
is surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule which is adherent at
the hilum.
Cut surface of the kidney shows 3 main structures: well-
demarcated peripheral cortex, inner medulla and the innermost
renal pelvis (Fig. 22.1):
The renal cortex forms the outer rim of the kidney and is
about 1 cm in thickness.  It contains all the glomeruli and
about 85% of the nephron tubules. Remaining 15% nephrons
consisting of collecting tubules, collecting ducts, loops of
Henle and vasa recta send their loops into the medulla, and
are therefore called juxtamedullary nephrons. This latter part
of the cortex forms faint striations called medullary rays, a
misnomer since theses structures are located in the cortex
but are destined for medulla. Columns of renal cortical tissue
that extend into the space between adjacent pyramids are
called the renal column (septa) of Bertin; they contain the
interlobar arteries.
The renal medulla is composed of 8-18 cone-shaped renal
pyramids. The base of a renal pyramid lies adjacent to the
outer cortex and forms the cortico-medullary junction, while
the apex of each called the renal papilla contains the opening
of each renal pyramid for passage of urine collected from
collecting ducts and goes down into minor calyces.
The renal pelvis is the funnel-shaped collection area of
the urine for drainage into the ureter. The minor calyces (8-
18 in number in a normal kidney) collect urine from renal
papillae and drain into major calyces (2-3 in a normal kidney).
HISTOLOGY. The parenchyma of each kidney is composed
of approximately one million microstructures called
nephrons. A nephron, in turn, consists of 5 major parts, each
having a functional role in the formation of urine: the
glomerular capsule (glomerulus and Bowman’s capsule), the
proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), the loop of Henle, the
distal convoluted tubule (DCT), and the collecting ducts.
From point of view of diseases of the kidneys, 4 components
of renal parenchyma require further elaboration: renal
vasculature, glomeruli, tubules and interstitium.
1.
Renal vasculature. Each kidney is supplied with blood
by a main renal artery which arises from the aorta at the level
of the 2nd lumbar vertebra. It usually divides into anterior
and posterior divisions at the hilum although occasionally these
divisions may even arise directly from the aorta. The anterior
and posterior divisions divide into segmental branches from
which interlobar arteries arise which course between the lobes.
Along their course, they give off the arcuate arteries which
arch between the cortex and medulla. The arcuate arteries,
in turn, give off interlobular arteries which lie in the cortex
perpendicular to the capsular surface in the part overlying
the pyramids and, therefore, are also called straight arteries
(Fig. 22.2). It is from the interlobular arteries that the afferent

Figure 22.2
Cross-section of the kidney showing arterial blood
supply.

650
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
arterioles take their origin, each one supplying a single
glomerulus. From the glomerulus emerge the efferent
arterioles. Up to this stage, the arteries and arterioles are end-
vessels. The efferent arterioles leaving the glomerulus supply
peritubular capillary plexus which anastomoses with the
capillary plexus of another nephron.
The juxtamedullary glomeruli, however, give off a series
of parallel vessels called vasa recta which descend to the inner
medulla supplying the loop of Henle and collecting ducts
and anastomose at all levels throughout the medulla with
the ascending vasa recta. These drain into arcuate veins and
then into the veins that accompany the corresponding arteries
and finally through a single renal vein into the inferior vena
cava (Fig. 22.3). Lymphatic drainage likewise occurs through
lymphatics associated with the intrarenal vasculature leaving
the kidney at the hilum and draining to lateral aortic lymph
nodes.
The following important inferences can be drawn from
the peculiarities of the renal vasculature:
i)
The renal cortex receives about 90% of the total renal
blood supply and that the pressure in the glomerular
capillaries is high. Therefore, renal cortex is more prone to
the effects of hypertension.
ii) The renal medulla, on the other hand, is poorly perfused
and any interference in blood supply to it results in medullary
necrosis.
iii) The divisions and subdivisions of the renal artery up to
arterioles are end-arteries and have no anastomoses. Thus,
occlusion of any of the branches results in infarction of the
renal parenchyma supplied by it.
iv) Since the tubular capillary beds are derived from the
efferent arterioles leaving the glomeruli, diseases affecting
the blood flow through glomerular tuft have significant
effects on the tubules as well.
2.
Glomerulus. The glomerulus consists of invagination of
the blind end of the proximal tubule and contains a capillary
tuft fed by the afferent arteriole and drained by efferent
arteriole. The capillary tuft is covered by visceral epithelial
cells (podocytes) which are continuous with those of the
parietal epithelium at the vascular pole. The transition to
proximal tubular cells occurs at the urinary pole of the
glomerulus. The visceral and parietal epithelial cells are
separated by the urinary space or Bowman’s space, into which
glomerular filtrate passes (Fig. 22.4).
Subdivisions of capillaries derived from the afferent
arterioles result in the formation of lobules (up to 8 in number)
within a glomerulus. Each lobule of a glomerular tuft consists
of a centrilobular supporting stalk composed of mesangium
containing mesangial cells and mesangial matrix. The
mesangium is continuous at the hilum with the lacis cells of
the juxtaglomerular apparatus. Besides their role as
supportive cells, mesangial cells are involved in the
production of mesangial matrix and glomerular basement
membrane; they function in endocytosis of leaked macro-
molecules and also possibly in the control of glomerular
blood flow through contractile elements present in these cells.
The major function of glomerulus is complex filtration
from the capillaries to the urinary space. Glomerular filtrate
is quite similar in composition to plasma but lacks proteins
and cells. Normally, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is about
125 ml/minute. The barrier to glomerular filtration consists
of the following 3 components (Fig. 22.5):
i)
Fenestrated endothelial cells lining the capillary loops.
ii) Glomerular basement membrane (GBM) on which the
endothelial cells rest. It further consists of 3 layers—the
central lamina densa, bounded by lamina rara interna on
endothelial side of the capillary and lamina rara externa on
visceral epithelial side of the capillary.
iii) Filtration slit pores between the foot processes of the
visceral epithelial cells (podocytes) external to GBM.
The barrier to filtration of macromolecules of the size and
molecular weight of albumin and larger depends upon the
following:
A normal lamina densa.
Maintenance of negative charge on both lamina rarae.
A healthy covering of glomerular epithelial cells.
Juxtaglomerular apparatus. The juxtaglomerular apparatus
(JGA) is situated at the vascular pole of the glomerulus and
is made up of 3 parts (Fig. 22.4):
Figure 22.3
A schematic illustration of the structure of a nephron
(in longitudinal section) and associated blood supply.

651
CHAPTER 22
The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tract
i)
The juxtaglomerular cells are modified granular smooth
muscle cells in the media of the afferent arteriole and contain
the hormone, renin.
ii) The macula densa is comprised by specialised region of
the distal tubule when it returns to the vascular pole of its
parent glomerulus. The tubular cells here are taller and
narrower than elsewhere with the nuclei lying close together.
iii) The lacis cells or non-granular cells occupy the space
between the macula densa and the arterioles and merge with
the glomerular mesangium.
The JGA is intimately concerned with sodium metabolism
and is the principal source of renin production. The
mechanism of the release of renin and its role in hypertension
are discussed on page 686.
3.
Tubules. The tubules of the kidney account for the
greatest amount of the renal parenchyma. The structure of
renal tubular epithelium varies in different parts of the
nephron and is correlated with the functional capacity of that
part of the tubule (see Fig. 22.3).
i)
Proximal convoluted tubule (PCT). This is the first part
arising from the glomerulus and is highly specialised part
functionally. It is lined by cuboidal cells with a brush border
composed of microvilli and contains numerous
mitochondria, Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum.
The major functions of PCT are: active reabsorption of filtered
sodium, potassium, glucose, amino acids, proteins, vitamins,
bicarbonate, phosphate, calcium and uric acid, and passive
reabsorption of 80% of filtered water.
ii) Loop of Henle. The PCT drains into the straight part of
loop of Henle that consists of thin descending, and thin and
thick ascending limbs, both of which have different structure
and function. The descending limb is continuation of PCT,
while ascending limb continues further into distal convoluted
tubule (DCT). The descending segment of loop is lined by
simple epithelium while the ascending limb is lined by
columnar cells. The major function of loop of Henle is active
reabsorption of sodium, potassium and chloride, and passive
diffusion of water resulting in concentrated filtrate of urine.
iii) Distal convoluted tubule (DCT). The DCT represents a
transition from thick ascending limb from the point where
the ascending limb meets the vascular pole of the glomerulus
of its origin, to the early collecting ducts. The lining cells in
Figure 22.4

652
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
DCT are cuboidal. The epithelial cells at the point of
beginning of DCT are taller, narrower and more closely
packed to form the macula densa of JGA as already described.
The DCT further contributes to urinary concentration and
acidification, while the macula densa of JGA is the source of
renin and has a role in sodium metabolism.
iv) Collecting ducts. The system of collecting ducts is the final
pathway by which urine reaches the tip of renal papilla. The
cells lining the collecting ducts are cuboidal but lack the brush
border. Collecting ducts reabsorb water under control of
ADH, and secrete H+ and K+ ions.
4.
Interstitium. In health, the renal cortical interstitium is
scanty and consists of a small number of fibroblast-like cells.
But the medullary interstitium is more plentiful and contains
stellate interstitial cells which are considered to produce an
anti-hypertensive agent and are involved in the metabolism
of prostaglandins.
RENAL FUNCTION  TESTS
In general, the kidney performs the following vital functions
in the body:
1.
Excretion of waste products resulting from protein
metabolism.
2.
Regulation of acid-base balance by excretion of H+ ions
(acidification) and bicarbonate ions.
3.
Regulation of salt-water balance by hormones secreted both
intra- and extra-renally.
4.
Formation of renin and erythropoietin and thereby playing
a role in the regulation of blood pressure and erythropoiesis
respectively.
In order to assess renal function, a number of tests have
been devised which give information regarding the following
parameters:
a) Renal blood flow
b) Glomerular filtration
c)
Renal tubular function
d) Urinary outflow unhindered by any obstruction.
Renal function tests are broadly divided into 4 groups
(Table 22.1):
1.
Urine analysis.
2.
Concentration and dilution tests.
3.
Blood chemistry.
4.
Renal clearance tests.
In addition, renal biopsy is performed to confirm the
diagnosis of renal disease. Renal biopsy is ideally fixed in
alcoholic Bouin’s solution and examined by routine morpho-
logy combined with special stains and further studies as
under:
1.
Periodic acid-Schiff stain for highlighting glomerular
basement membrane.
2.
Silver impregnation to outline the glomerular and tubular
basement membrane.
3.
Immunofluorescence to localise the antigens, complements
and immunoglobulins.
4.
Electron microscopy to see the ultrastructure of glomerular
changes.
1.
URINE ANALYSIS. The simplest diagnostic tests for
renal function is the physical, chemical, bacteriologic and
microscopic examination of the urine.
i)
The physical examination includes 24-hour urinary output,
colour, specific gravity and osmolality. Normally urine is
clear, pale or straw-coloured due to pigment urochrome and
700-2500 ml (average 1200 ml) of urine is passed in 24 hours,
mostly during day time. Specific gravity is used to measure
the concentrating and diluting power of the kidneys.
ii) The chemical tests are carried out to detect the presence of
protein, glucose, red cells and haemoglobin to assess the
permeability of glomerular membrane. A number of
convenient dipstick tests are available for testing these
chemical substances and pH. These consist of paper strips
impregnated with appropriate reagents and indicator dyes.
ii) The bacteriologic examination of the urine is done by proper
and aseptic collection of midstream specimen of urine.
iv) Urine microscopy is undertaken on a fresh unstained
sample. Various components observed on microscopic
examination of the urine in renal disease are red cells, pus
cells, epithelial cells, crystals and urinary casts. The casts are
moulded into cylindrical shapes by passage along tubules
in which they are formed. They are the result of precipitation
of proteins in the tubule that includes not only albumin but
also the tubular secretion of the Tamm Horsfall protein. The
latter is a high molecular weight glycoprotein normally
secreted by ascending loop of Henle and DCT and probably
has body defense function normally. Its secretion is increased
in glomerular and tubular diseases. Casts may be hyaline type
consisting of only proteins indicating a non-inflammatory
etiology of glomerular filtration of proteins, leucocyte casts
inflammatory in origin, or red cell casts from haematuria.
2.
CONCENTRATION AND DILUTION TESTS. Concen-
tration and dilution tests are designed to evaluate functional
capacity of the renal tubules. The ability of the nephron to
concentrate or dilute urine is dependent upon both functional
activity of the tubular cells in the renal medulla and the

presence of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Failure to achieve
adequate urinary concentration can be due to either defects
within the renal medulla (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), or
due to the lack of ADH (central diabetes insipidus).
Traditionally, urinary concentration is determined by
specific gravity of the urine (normal range 1.003 to 1.030,
average 1.018) which in cases of tubular disease remains
constant at approximately 1.010 regardless of changing levels
of plasma hydration. However, determination of urinary
specific gravity provides only a rough estimate of osmolarity
of the urine. The tubular disease can be diagnosed in its early
stage by water deprivation (concentration) or water excess
(dilution) tests.
i)
In concentration test, an artificial fluid deprivation is
induced in the patient for more than 20 hours. If the nephron
is normal, water is selectively reabsorbed resulting in
excretion of urine of high solute concentration (specific
gravity of 1.025 or more). However, if the tubular cells are
nonfunctional, the solute concentration of the urine will
remain constant regardless of stress of water deprivation.
ii) In dilution test, an excess of fluid is given to the patient.
Normally, renal compensation should result in excretion of
urine with high water content and lower solute concentration
(specific gravity of 1.003 or less). If the renal tubules are
diseased, the concentration of solutes in the urine will remain
constant irrespective of the excess water intake.
3.
BLOOD CHEMISTRY. Impairment of renal function
results in elevation of end-products of protein metabolism.
This includes increased accumulation of certain substances
in the blood, chiefly urea (normal range 20-40 mg/dl), blood
urea nitrogen (BUN) (normal range 10-20 mg/dl) and
creatinine (normal range 0.6-1.2 mg/dl). An increase of these
end-products in the blood is called azotaemia.
High levels of creatinine are associated with high levels
of β2-microglobulin in the serum as well as urine, a low-
molecular weight protein filtered excessively in the urine due
to glomerular disease or due to increased production by the
liver.
4.
RENAL CLEARANCE TESTS. A clearance test is
employed to assess the rate of glomerular filtration and the
renal blood flow. The rate of this filtration can be measured
by determining the excretion rate of a substance which is
filtered through the glomerulus but subsequently is neither
reabsorbed nor secreted by the tubules. The glomerular
filtration rate (normal 120 ml/minute in an average adult) is
usually equal to clearance of that substance and is calculated
from the following equation:
UV
C =  _______ where
P
C
is the clearance of the substance in ml/ minute;
U is the concentration of the substance in the urine;
V
is the volume of urine passed per minute; and
P
is the concentration of the substance in the plasma.
The substances which are used for clearance tests include
inulin, mannitol, creatinine and urea.
i)
In inulin or mannitol clearance tests, an intravenous
infusion of the substance inulin or mannitol is given to
maintain constant plasma concentration and accurately timed
urine samples are collected. Inulin, a mixture of fructose
polymers, is considered the ideal substance for the clearance
test since it is filtered from the glomerulus and is excreted
unchanged in the urine.
ii) In creatinine clearance test, there is no need of intra-
venous infusion of creatinine since creatinine is normally
released into plasma by muscle metabolism and a very small
fraction of this substance is secreted by the tubules. The
clearance of creatinine is determined by collecting urine over
24-hour period and a blood sample is withdrawn during the
day. In spite of disadvantages like poor reproducibility and
secretion of creatinine by the tubules, the ‘endogenous’
creatinine clearance test is easy and routinely employed
method of estimating GFR.
iii) In urea clearance test, the sensitivity is much less than
the creatinine or inulin clearance because plasma
concentration of urea is affected by a number of factors (e.g.
dietary protein, fluid intake, infection, trauma, surgery, and
corticosteroids) and is partly reabsorbed by the tubules. Like
in creatinine clearance, there is no need for intravenous
infusion of urea.
iv) Para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) clearance test is
employed to measure renal blood flow (unlike the preceding
tests which measure GFR). PAH when infused intravenously
is both filtered at the glomerulus as well as secreted by the
tubules and its clearance is measured by determining its
concentration in arterial blood and urine. Normally, renal
blood flow is about 1200 ml per minute in an average adult.
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF RENAL DISEASE:
RENAL FAILURE
Traditionally, diseases of the kidneys are divided into 4 major
groups according to the predominant involvement of
corresponding morphologic components:
1.
Glomerular diseases: These are most often immuno-
logically-mediated and may be acute or chronic.
2.
Tubular diseases: These are more likely to be caused by
toxic or infectious agents and are often acute.
3.
Interstitial diseases: These are likewise commonly due to
toxic or infectious agents and quite often involve interstitium
as well as tubules (tubulo-interstitial diseases).
4.
Vascular diseases: These include changes in the nephron
as a consequence of increased intra-glomerular pressure such
as in hypertension or impaired blood flow.
In addition, other diseases described in this chapter
include: congenital anomalies, obstructive uropathy
(including urolithiasis) and tumours of the kidneys.
The major morphologic involvements of the kidneys in
the initial stage is confined to one component (glomeruli,
tubules, interstitium or blood vessels), but eventually all
components are affected leading to end-stage kidneys.
Regardless of cause, renal disease usually results in the
evolution of one of the two major pathological syndromes:
acute renal failure and chronic renal failure. The term ‘azotaemia’
is used for biochemical abnormality characterised by
elevation of the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine
levels, while ‘uraemia’ is defined as association of these

654
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
biochemical abnormalities with clinical signs and symptoms.
The pathophysiological aspects of acute and chronic renal
failure are briefly discussed below.
Acute Renal Failure (ARF)
Acute renal failure (ARF) is a syndrome characterised by
rapid onset of renal dysfunction, chiefly oliguria or anuria,
and sudden increase in metabolic waste-products (urea and
creatinine) in the blood with consequent development of
uraemia.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The causes of ARF may be classified
as pre-renal, intra-renal and post-renal in nature.
1.
Pre-renal causes. Pre-renal diseases are those which cause
sudden decrease in blood flow to the nephron. Renal
ischaemia ultimately results in functional disorders or
depression of GFR, or both. These causes include inadequate
cardiac output and hypovolaemia or vascular disease causing
reduced perfusion of the kidneys.
2.
Intra-renal causes. Intra-renal disease is characterised by
disease of renal tissue itself. These include vascular disease
of the arteries and arterioles within the kidney, diseases of
glomeruli, acute tubular necrosis due to ischaemia, or the
effect of a nephrotoxin, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis and
pyelonephritis.
3.
Post-renal causes. Post-renal disease is characteristically
caused by obstruction to the flow of urine anywhere along
the renal tract distal to the opening of the collecting ducts.
This may be caused by a mass within the lumen or from wall
of the tract, or from external compression anywhere along
the lower urinary tract—ureter, bladder neck or urethra.
It is important to note that ARF originating in pre- and
post-renal disease, such as by renal ischaemia or renal
infection, eventually leads to intra-renal disease. Thus, full-
blown ARF reflects some degree of nephron damage.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The clinical features will depend
to a large extent on the underlying cause of ARF and on the
stage of the disease at which the patient presents. However,
one of the following three major patterns usually emerge:
1.
Syndrome of acute nephritis. This is most frequently
associated with acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis
and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Renal
dysfunction results from extensive proliferation of epithelial
cells in the glomeruli with consequent mild increase in
glomerular permeability and decrease in GFR. The
characteristic features are: mild proteinuria, haematuria,
oedema and mild hypertension. Fluid retention in acute
nephritis syndrome appears to be due to both diminished
GFR and increased salt and water reabsorption in distal
nephron.
2.
Syndrome accompanying tubular pathology. When the
ARF is caused by destruction of the tubular cells of the
nephron as occurs in acute tubular necrosis (page 679), the
disease typically progresses through 3 characteristic stages
from oliguria to diuresis to recovery.
i)
Oliguric phase: The initial oliguric phase lasting on an
average from 7 to 10 days is characterised by urinary output
of less than 400 ml per day. The decline in formation of the
urine leads to accumulation of waste products of protein
metabolism in the blood and resultant azotaemia, metabolic
acidosis, hyperkalaemia, hypernatraemia and hypervolaemia
due to secondary effects of circulatory overload and
pulmonary oedema. The specific gravity of the urine is low
but the concentration of sodium in urine tends to be elevated.
ii) Diuretic phase: With the onset of healing of tubules, there
is improvement in urinary output. This is believed to occur
due to drawing of water and sodium by preceding high levels
of creatinine and urea as they move through the nephron so
as to be excreted. Since tubular cells have not regained normal
functional capacity, the urine is of low or fixed specific
gravity.
iii) Phase of recovery: Full recovery with healing of tubular
epithelial cells occurs in about half the cases, while others
terminate in death. The process of healing may take up to
one year with restoration of normal tubular function.
3.
Pre-renal syndrome. The ARF occurring secondary to
disorders in which neither the glomerulus nor the tubules
are damaged, results in pre-renal syndrome. Typically, this
pattern is seen in marginal ischaemia caused by renal arterial
obstruction, hypovolaemia, hypotension or cardiac
insufficiency. Due to depressed renal blood flow, there is
decrease in GFR causing oliguria, azotaemia (elevation of
BUN and creatinine) and possible fluid retention and
oedema. Since the tubular cells are functioning normally, the
nephron retains its ability to concentrate the glomerular
filtrate according to the adaptive needs.
Chronic Renal Failure (CRF)
Chronic renal failure is a syndrome characterised by
progressive and irreversible deterioration of renal function
due to slow destruction of renal parenchyma, eventually
terminating in death when sufficient number of nephrons
have been damaged. Acidosis is the major problem in CRF
with development of biochemical azotaemia and clinical
uraemia syndrome.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. All chronic nephropathies can lead
to CRF. The diseases leading to CRF can generally be
classified into two major groups: those causing glomerular
pathology, and those causing tubulointerstitial pathology. Though
this classification is useful to facilitate study, the disease
rarely remains confined to either glomeruli or tubulo-
interstitial tissue alone. In the final stage of CRF, all parts of
the nephron are involved.
1.
Diseases causing glomerular pathology. A number of
glomerular diseases associated with CRF have their patho-
genesis in immune mechanisms (page 662). Glomerular
destruction results in changes in filtration process and leads
to development of the nephrotic syndrome characterised by
proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia and oedema. The important
examples of chronic glomerular diseases causing CRF are
covered under two headings: primary and systemic.
i)
Primary glomerular pathology: The major cause of CRF is
chronic glomerulonephritis, usually initiated by various
types of glomerulonephritis such as membranous glomerulo-

655
CHAPTER 22
The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tract
nephritis, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, lipoid
nephrosis (minimal change disease) and anti-glomerular
basement membrane nephritis.
ii) Systemic glomerular pathology: Certain conditions originate
outside the renal system but induce changes in the nephrons
secondarily. Major examples of this type are systemic lupus
erythematosus, serum sickness nephritis and diabetic
nephropathy.
2.
Diseases causing tubulointerstitial pathology. Damage
to tubulointerstitial tissues results in alterations in
reabsorption and secretion of important constituents leading
to excretion of large volumes of dilute urine. Tubulointer-
stitial diseases can be categorised according to initiating
etiology into 4 groups: vascular, infectious, toxic and
obstructive.
i)
Vascular causes: Long-standing primary or essential
hypertension produces characteristic changes in renal arteries
and arterioles referred to as nephrosclerosis (page 687).
Nephrosclerosis causes progressive renal vascular occlusion
terminating in ischaemia and necrosis of renal tissue.
ii) Infectious causes: A good example of chronic renal infec-
tion causing CRF is chronic pyelonephritis. The chronicity
of process results in progressive damage to increasing
number of nephrons leading to CRF.
iii) Toxic causes: Some toxic substances induce slow tubular
injury, eventually culminating in CRF. The most common
example is intake of high doses of analgesics such as
phenacetin, aspirin and acetaminophen (chronic analgesic
nephritis). Other substances that can cause CRF after
prolonged exposure are lead, cadmium and uranium.
iv) Obstructive causes: Chronic obstruction in the urinary tract
leads to progressive damage to the nephron due to fluid back-
pressure. The examples of this type of chronic injury are
stones, blood clots, tumours, strictures and enlarged prostate.
Regardless of the initiating cause, CRF evolves
progressively through 4 stages:
1.
Decreased renal reserve. At this stage, damage to renal
parenchyma is marginal and the kidneys remain functional.
The GFR is about 50% of normal, BUN and creatinine values
are normal and the patients are usually asymptomatic except
at times of stress.
2.
Renal insufficiency. At this stage, about 75% of
functional renal parenchyma has been destroyed. The GFR
is about 25% of normal accompanied by elevation in BUN
and serum creatinine. Polyuria and nocturia occur due to
tubulointerstitial damage. Sudden stress may precipitate
uraemic syndrome.
3.
Renal failure. At this stage, about 90% of functional renal
tissue has been destroyed. The GFR is approximately 10% of
normal. Tubular cells are essentially nonfunctional. As a
result, the regulation of sodium and water is lost resulting
in oedema, metabolic acidosis, hypocalcaemia, and signs and
symptoms of uraemia.
4.
End-stage kidney. The GFR at this stage is less than 5%
of normal and results in complex clinical picture of uraemic
syndrome with progressive primary (renal) and secondary
systemic (extra-renal) symptoms.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Clinical manifestations of full-
blown CRF culminating in uraemic syndrome are described
under 2 main headings: primary (renal) uraemic manifes-
tations and secondary (systemic or extra-renal) uraemic
manifestations.
A. Primary uraemic (renal) manifestations. Primary
symptoms of uraemia develop when there is slow and
progressive deterioration of renal function. The resulting
imbalances cause the following manifestations:
1.
Metabolic acidosis. As a result of renal dysfunction, acid-
base balance is progressively lost. Excess of hydrogen ions
occurs, while bicarbonate level declines in the blood, resulting
in metabolic acidosis. The clinical symptoms of metabolic
acidosis include: compensatory Kussmaul breathing,
hyperkalaemia and hypercalcaemia.
2.
Hyperkalaemia. A decreased GFR results in excessive
accumulation of potassium in the blood since potassium is
normally excreted mainly in the urine. Hyperkalaemia is
further worsened by metabolic acidosis. The clinical features
of hyperkalaemia are: cardiac arrhythmias, weakness,
nausea, intestinal colic, diarrhoea, muscular irritability and
flaccid paralysis.
3.
Sodium and water imbalance. As GFR declines, sodium
and water cannot pass sufficiently into Bowman’s capsule
leading to their retention. Release of renin from
juxtaglomerular apparatus further aggravates sodium and
water retention. The main symptoms referable to sodium and
water retention are: hypervolaemia and circulatory overload
with congestive heart failure.
4.
Hyperuricaemia. Decreased GFR results in excessive
accumulation of uric acid in the blood. Uric acid crystals may
be deposited in joints and soft tissues resulting in gout.
5.
Azotaemia. The waste-products of protein metabolism
fail to be excreted resulting in elevation in the blood levels
of urea, creatinine, phenols and guanidines causing
biochemical abnormality, azotaemia. The secondary
manifestations of uraemia are related to toxic effects of these
metabolic waste-products.
B. Secondary uraemic (extra-renal) manifestations. A
number of extra-renal systemic manifestations develop
secondarily following fluid-electrolyte and acid-base
imbalances. These include the following:
1.
Anaemia. Decreased production of erythropoietin by
diseased kidney results in decline in erythropoiesis and
anaemia. Besides, gastrointestinal bleeding may further
aggravate anaemia.
2.
Integumentary system. Deposit of urinary pigment such
as urochrome in the skin causes sallow-yellow colour. The
urea content in the sweat as well as in the plasma rises. On
evaporation of the perspiration, urea remains on the facial
skin as powdery ‘uraemic frost’.
3.
Cardiovascular system. Fluid retention secondarily
causes cardiovascular symptoms such as increased workload
on the heart due to the hypervolaemia and eventually
congestive heart failure.
4.
Respiratory system. Hypervolaemia and heart failure
cause pulmonary congestion and pulmonary oedema due

656
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
to back pressure. Radiologically, uraemic pneumonitis shows
characteristic central, butterfly-pattern of oedema and
congestion in the chest radiograph.
5.
Digestive system. Azotaemia directly induces mucosal
ulcerations in the lining of the stomach and intestines.
Subsequent bleeding can aggravate the existing anaemia.
Gastrointestinal irritation may cause nausea, vomiting and
diarrhoea.
6.
Skeletal system. The skeletal manifestations of renal
failure are referred to as renal osteodystrophy (Chapter 28).
Two major types of skeletal disorders may occur:
i)
Osteomalacia occurs from deficiency of a form of vitamin
D which is normally activated by the kidney (page 248). Since
vitamin D is essential for absorption of calcium, its deficiency
results in inadequate deposits of calcium in bone tissue.
ii) Osteitis fibrosa occurs due to elevated levels of
parathormone. How parathormone excess develops in CRF
is complex. As the GFR is decreased, increasing levels of
phosphates accumulate in the extracellular fluid which, in
turn, cause decline in calcium levels. Decreased calcium level
triggers the secretion of parathormone which mobilises
calcium from bone and increases renal tubular reabsorption
of calcium thereby conserving it. However, if the process of
resorption of calcium phosphate from bone continues for
sufficient time, hypercalcaemia may be induced with
deposits of excess calcium salts in joints and soft tissues and
weakening of bones (renal osteodystrophy).
CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS
Approximately 10% of all persons are born with potentially
significant malformations of the urinary system. These range
in severity from minor anomalies which may not produce
clinical manifestations to major anomalies which are
incompatible with extrauterine life. About half of all patients
with malformations of the kidneys have coexistent anomalies
either elsewhere in the urinary tract or in other organs.
Malformations of the kidneys are classified into 3 broad
groups:
I.
Abnormalities in amount of renal tissue. These include:
anomalies with deficient renal parenchyma (e.g. unilateral
or bilateral renal hypoplasia) or with excess renal tissue (e.g.
renomegaly, supernumerary kidneys).
II. Anomalies of position, form and orientation. These are:
renal ectopia (pelvic kidney), renal fusion (horseshoe kidney)
and persistent foetal lobation.
III. Anomalies of differentiation. This group consists of the
more important and common morphologic forms covered
under the heading of ‘cystic diseases of the kidney’ described
in detail below.
CYSTIC DISEASES OF KIDNEY
Cystic lesions of the kidney may be congenital or acquired,
non-neoplastic or neoplastic. Majority of these lesions are
congenital non-neoplastic. Cystic lesions in the kidney may
occur at any age, extending from foetal life (detected on
ultrasonography) to old age. Their clinical presentation may
include: abdominal mass, infection, respiratory distress (due
to accompanied pulmonary hypoplasia), haemorrhage, and
neoplastic transformation.
Potter divided developmental renal cystic lesions into
three types—I, II and III. A simple classification including
all cystic lesions of the kidney is given in Table 22.2 and
Fig. 22.6. Non-neoplastic lesions are discussed below while

CHAPTER 22
The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tract
neoplastic cystic lesions of the kidney are described later
(page 694).
I.
Multicystic Renal Dysplasia
The term ‘multicystic renal dysplasia’ or Potter type II is used
for disorganised metanephrogenic differentiation with
persistence of structures in the kidney which are not
represented in normal nephrogenesis.  Renal dysplasia is the
most common form of cystic renal disease in the newborn
and infants. The condition may occur sporadically or maybe
familial and part of a syndrome of other anomalies. It is
commonly associated with obstructive abnormalities of the
ureter and lower urinary tract such as obstruction of
pelviureteric junction (PUJ), ureteral atresia and urethral
obstruction.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Renal dysplasia may be
unilateral or bilateral. The dysplastic process may involve
the entire renal mass or a part of it.
Grossly, the dysplastic kidney is almost always cystic. The
kidney or its affected part is replaced by disorderly mass
of multiple cysts resembling a bunch of grapes. Normal
renal parenchyma is almost totally obscured by the mass
while calyces and pelvis may not be recognised. The ureter
is invariably abnormal, being either absent or atretic.
Histologically, the characteristic feature is the presence
of undifferentiated mesenchyme that contains smooth
muscle, cartilage and immature collecting ducts. The cysts
in the mass represent dilated tubules lined by flattened
epithelium which are surrounded by concentric layers of
connective tissue (Fig. 22.7). Glomeruli and tubules are
scanty, primitive or absent.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Unilateral renal dysplasia is
frequently discovered in newborn or infants as a flank mass.
Often, renal dysplasia is associated with other congenital
malformations and syndromes such as ventricular septal
defect, 
tracheo-esophageal 
fistula, 
lumbosacral
meningomyelocele and Down’s syndrome.
The prognosis of unilateral renal dysplasia following
removal of the abnormal kidney is excellent while bilateral
renal dysplasia results in death in infancy unless renal
transplant is done.
II. Polycystic Kidney Disease
Polycystic disease of the kidney (PKD) is a disorder in which
major portion of the renal parenchyma is converted into cysts
of varying size. The disease occurs in two forms:
A. An adult type inherited as an autosomal dominant disease;
and
B. An infantile type inherited as an autosomal recessive
disorder.
A. ADULT POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE
Adult (autosomal dominant) polycystic kidney disease
(ADPKD) is relatively common (incidence 1:400 to 1: 1:1000)
and is the cause of end-stage renal failure in approximately
4% of haemodialysis patients. The pattern of inheritance is
autosomal dominant with mutation in PKD gene: mutation in
PKD-1 gene located on chromosome 16 in over 85% cases
(ADPKD-1) while remainder 15% cases have mutation in
PKD-2 gene located on chromosome 4 (ADPKD-2). Family
history of similar renal disease may be present. The true adult
polycystic renal disease is always bilateral and diffuse.
Though the kidneys are abnormal at birth, renal function is
retained, and symptoms appear in adult life, mostly between
the age of 30 and 50 years.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, kidneys in
ADPKD are always bilaterally enlarged, usually symme-
trically, heavy (weighing up to 4 kg) and give it a lobulated
appearance on external surface due to underlying cysts .
The cut surface shows cysts throughout the renal
parenchyma varying in size from tiny cysts to 4-5 cm in
diameter (Fig. 22.8,A). The contents of the cysts vary from
clear straw-yellow fluid to reddish-brown material. The
renal pelvis and calyces are present but are greatly
distorted by the cysts and may contain concretions
(Fig. 22.9). The cysts, however, do not communicate with
the pelvis of the kidney—a feature that helps to distinguish
polycystic kidney from hydronephrosis of the kidney on
sectioned surface (page 692).
Histologically, the cysts arise from all parts of nephron.
It is possible to find some cysts containing recognisable
glomerular tufts reflecting their origin from Bowman’s
capsule, while others have epithelial lining like that of
distal or proximal tubules or collecting ducts. The
intervening tissue between the cysts shows some normal
renal parenchyma. With advancement of age of the
patient, acquired lesions such as pyelonephritis,
nephrosclerosis, fibrosis and chronic inflammation are
seen with increasingly frequency.
Figure 22.7
Renal cystic dysplasia. There are cysts lined by flattened
epithelium while the intervening parenchyma consists of primitive
connective tissue and cartilage.

658
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
CLINICAL FEATURES. The condition may become
clinically apparent at any age but most commonly manifests
in 3rd to 5th decades of life. The most frequent and earliest
presenting feature is a dull-ache in the lumbar regions. In
others, the presenting complaints are haematuria or passage
of blood clots in urine, renal colic, hypertension, urinary tract
infections and progressive CRF with polyuria and
proteinuria.
ADPKD is considered a systemic disease. About a third
of patients with ADPKD have cysts of the liver (Chapter 21).
Other associated congenital anomalies seen less frequently
are cysts in the pancreas, spleen, lungs and other organs.
Approximately 15% of patients have one or more intracranial
berry aneurysms of the circle of Willis. Any acquired renal
disease is more prone to occur in polycystic kidneys.
B. INFANTILE POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE
The infantile (autosomal recessive) form of polycystic kidney
disease (ARPKD) is distinct from the adult form and is less
common (incidence 1:20,000 births). It is transmitted as an
autosomal recessive trait and the family history of similar
disease is usually not present. The condition occurs due to a
mutation in chromosome 6—6p21, PKHD1 (polycystic kidney
and hepatic disease 1). It is invariably bilateral. The age at
presentation may be perinatal, neonatal, infantile or juvenile,
but frequently serious manifestations are present at birth and
result in death from renal failure in early childhood.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the kidneys are
bilaterally enlarged with smooth external surface and
retained normal reniform shape. Cut surface reveals small,
fusiform or cylindrical cysts radiating from the medulla
and extend radially to the outer cortex. This gives the
sectioned surface of the kidney sponge-like appearance
(Fig. 22.8,B). No normal renal parenchyma is grossly
recognised. Pelvis, calyces and ureters are normal.
Histologically, the total number of nephrons is normal.
Since the cysts are formed from dilatation of collecting
tubules, all the collecting tubules show cylindrical or
saccular dilatations and are lined by cuboidal to low
columnar epithelium. Many of the glomeruli are also
cystically dilated.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The clinical manifestations depend
on age of the child. In severe form, the gross bilateral cystic
renal enlargement may interfere with delivery. In infancy,
renal failure may manifest early. Almost all cases of infantile
polycystic kidney disease have associated multiple
epithelium-lined cysts in the liver or proliferation of portal
bile ductules. In older children, associated hepatic changes
evelop into what is termed congenital hepatic fibrosis which
may lead to portal hypertension and splenomegaly.
The contrasting features of the two main forms of the
polycystic kidney disease are presented in Table 22.3.
III. Medullary Cystic Disease
Cystic disease of the renal medulla has two main types:
A. Medullary sponge kidney, a relatively common and
innocuous condition; and
B. Nephronophthiasis-medullary cystic disease complex, a
common cause of chronic renal failure in juvenile age group.
A. MEDULLARY SPONGE KIDNEY
Medullary sponge kidney consists of multiple cystic
dilatations of the papillary ducts in the medulla. It has an
autosomal dominant transmission. The condition occurs in
adults and may be recognised as an incidental radiographic
finding in asymptomatic cases, or the patients may complain
of colicky flank pain, dysuria, haematuria and passage of
sandy material in the urine. Renal function remains largely

Polycystic kidney disease. Diagrammatic representation
of comparison of gross appearance of the two main forms.
Figure 22.9
Adult (autosomal dominant) polycystic kidney disease
(ADPKD). The kidney is enlarged and heavy. Sectioned surface shows
loss of demarcation between cortex and medulla and replacement of the
entire renal parenchyma by cyst s varying in diameter from a few
millimeters to 4-5 cm. These cysts are not communicating with the pelvi-
calyceal system. The renal pelvis and calyces are distorted due to cystic
change.

659
CHAPTER 22
The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tract
normal or may be mildly impaired in long-standing disease
with secondary complications of infection and calculus
formation.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the kidneys may
be enlarged, normal or shrunken in size depending upon
the extent of secondary pyelonephritis. On cut surface,
the characteristic feature is the presence of several, small
(less than 0.5 cm diameter), cystically dilated papillary
ducts, which may contain spherical calculi.
Microscopically, the cysts are lined by tall columnar,
cuboidal, transitional or squamous epithelium. Renal
cortex may show secondary pyelonephritis but cortical
cysts are never a component of medullary sponge kidney.
B. NEPHRONOPHTHIASIS-MEDULLARY
CYSTIC DISEASE COMPLEX
This form of medullary cystic disease, also called juvenile
nephronophthiasis or uraemic sponge kidney, is a progressive
renal disease. It is classified into infantile, juvenile and
adolescent type depending upon the age at presentation,
juvenile form being the most common. It is the most common
form of genetic cause of end-stage renal disease in children
and adolescents. The condition has an autosomal recessive
inheritance. Familial occurrence is common. The clinical
manifestations are due to impaired urinary concentration
consequent upon the medullary lesions and consist of poly-
uria, polydipsia and enuresis. Other features include renal
osteodystrophy, growth retardation, anaemia and
progressive renal failure leading to uraemia.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the kidneys are
moderately reduced in size and granular and have narrow
cortices. Cut surface reveals minute cysts, majority of
which are present at the cortico-medullary junction.
Microscopically, the cysts are lined by flattened or
cuboidal epithelium. There is widespread nonspecific
chronic inflammatory infiltrate and interstitial fibrosis.
Many glomeruli are hyalinised but tubular atrophy is
more pronounced due to marked thickening of tubular
basement membrane.
IV. Simple Renal Cysts
Simple renal cysts are a very common postmortem finding.
They are seen in about half of all persons above the age of 50
years. Since these cysts are rare in infants and children, they
appear to be acquired rather than congenital lesions. Simple
cysts of the kidneys are rarely responsible for symptoms.
However, symptoms may result from rupture, haemorrhage
or infection. The association between simple cysts and
hypertension is common.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, simple renal
cysts are usually solitary but may be multiple. They are
commonly located in the cortex. Their size varies from a
few millimeters to 10 cm in diameter. The wall of cyst is
characteristically yellowish-white and translucent. The
cyst usually contains clear straw-coloured fluid which may
become rust-coloured due to haemorrhage.
Microscopically, the lining of the cyst is by flattened
epithelium. The cyst wall contains variable amount of
collagenised fibrous tissue which may occasionally have
deposits of haemosiderin or calcium salts.
V. Acquired Renal Cysts
A number of acquired conditions give rise to renal cysts.
These include the following:
1.
Patients with end-stage renal disease on prolonged
dialysis (dialysis-associated cystic disease).
2.
Hydatid (echinococcal) cyst.
3.
Tuberculosis of the kidney.
4.
Cystic degeneration in carcinoma of kidney.
5.
Traumatic intrarenal haematoma.
6.
Drug-induced cystic disease in experimental animals.
VI. Pararenal Cysts
Cysts occurring adjacent to a kidney are termed pararenal
cysts. These include the following:
1.
Pyelocalyceal cysts
2.
Hilar lymphangiectatic cysts
3.
Retroperitoneal cysts
4.
Perinephric pseudocysts from trauma.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
GLOMERULAR DISEASES
DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION
Glomerular diseases encompass a large and clinically
significant group of renal diseases. Glomerulonephritis (GN)
or Bright’s disease is the term used for diseases that primarily
involve the renal glomeruli. It is convenient to classify
glomerular diseases into 2 broad groups:
I.
Primary glomerulonephritis in which the glomeruli are the
predominant site of involvement.
II. Secondary glomerular diseases include certain systemic and
hereditary diseases which secondarily affect the glomeruli.
Though this division is widely followed, it is somewhat
arbitrary since many primary forms of glomerulonephritis
have systemic effects, and many systemic diseases may
initially present with glomerular involvement. Many
classifications of different types of glomerulonephiritis have
been described, but most widely accepted classification is
based on clinical presentation and pathologic changes in the
glomeruli given in Table 22.4.
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
The clinical presentation of glomerular disease is quite
variable but in general four features—proteinuria, haema-
turia, hypertension and disturbed excretory function, are
present in varying combinations depending upon the
underlying condition. A firm diagnosis, however, can be
established by examination of renal biopsy under light,
electron and immunofluorescence microscopy.
A number of clinical syndromes are recognised in
glomerular diseases. The following are six major glomerular
syndromes commonly found in different glomerular diseases:
nephritic and nephrotic syndromes;
acute and chronic renal failure;
asymptomatic proteinuria and haematuria.
These are briefly described below.
I.
ACUTE NEPHRITIC SYNDROME. This is the acute
onset of haematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, oedema and
oliguria following an infective illness about 10 to 20 days
earlier.
1.
The haematuria is generally slight giving the urine smoky
appearance and erythrocytes are detectable by microscopy
or by chemical testing for haemoglobin. Appearance of red
cell casts is another classical feature of acute nephritic
syndrome.
2.
The proteinuria is mild (less than 3 gm per 24 hrs) and is
usually non-selective (nephritic range proteinuria).
3.
Hypertension is variable depending upon the severity
of the glomerular disease but is generally mild.
4.
Oedema in nephritic syndrome is usually mild and
results from sodium and water retention (page 97).
5.
Oliguria is variable and reflects the severity of glomerular
involvement.
The underlying causes of acute nephritic syndrome may
be primary glomerulonephritic diseases (classically acute
glomerulonephritis and rapidly progressive glomerulo-
nephritis) or certain systemic diseases (Table 22.5).
II. NEPHROTIC SYNDROME Nephrotic syndrome is a
constellation of features in different diseases having varying
pathogenesis; it is characterised by findings of massive
proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema, hyperlipidaemia,
lipiduria, and hypercoagulability.
1.
Heavy proteinuria (protein loss of more than 3 gm per
24 hrs) is the chief characteristic of nephrotic syndrome
(nephrotic range proteinuria). In children, protein loss is
correspondingly less. A small amount of protein (20 to 150
mg/day) normally passes through the glomerular filtration
barrier and is reabsorbed by the tubules. But in case of
increased glomerular permeability to plasma proteins, excess
of protein is filtered out exceeding the capacity of tubules
for reabsorption and, therefore, appears in the urine. Another
feature of protein loss is its ‘selectivity’. A highly-selective
proteinuria consists mostly of loss of low molecular weight
proteins, while a poorly-selective proteinuria is loss of high
molecular weight proteins in the urine. In nephrotic
syndrome, proteinuria mostly consists of loss of albumin
(molecular weight 66,000) in the urine.
2.
Hypoalbuminaemia is produced primarily consequent
to urinary loss of albumin, and partly due to increased renal
catabolism and inadequate hepatic synthesis of albumin.

The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tract
Often, the plasma albumin level is 1 to 3 gm/dl (normal 3.5
to 5.5 gm/dl) and there is reversed albumin-globulin ratio.
The concentration of other proteins in the plasma such as
immunoglobulins, clotting factors and antithrombin may fall
rendering these patients more vulnerable to infections and
thrombotic and thromboembolic complications.
3.
Oedema in nephrotic syndrome appears due to fall in
colloid osmotic pressure consequent upon hypo-
albuminaemia. Sodium and water retention further
contribute to oedema. Nephrotic oedema is usually
peripheral but in children facial oedema may be more
prominent (page 99).
4.
Hyperlipidaemia is a frequent accompaniment of
nephrotic syndrome. The exact mechanism of its genesis is
not clear. It is hypothesised that the liver faced with the stress
of massive protein synthesis in response to heavy urinary
protein loss, also causes increased synthesis of lipoproteins.
There are increased blood levels of total lipids, cholesterol,
triglycerides, VLDL and LDL but decrease in HDL. Low
blood level of HDL is partly due to its loss in the urine.
5.
Lipiduria occurs following hyperlipidaemia due to
excessive leakiness of glomerular filtration barrier.
6.
Hypercoagulability. Patients with nephrotic syndrome
may develop spontaneous arterial or venous thrombosis,
renal vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism due to
various factors. These include: increased urinary loss of
antithrombin III, hyperfibrinogenaemia from increased
synthesis in the liver, decreased fibrinolysis, increased
platelet aggregation and altered levels of protein C and S.
The causes of nephrotic syndrome are diverse and are
listed in Table 22.6. The morphology of individual types is
described later. But it must be mentioned here that:
in children, primary glomerulonephritis is the cause in
majority of cases of the nephrotic syndrome; most frequent
is lipoid nephrosis (65%); and
in adults, on the other hand, systemic diseases (diabetes,
amyloidosis and SLE) are more frequent causes of nephrotic
syndrome. The most common primary glomerular disease
in adults is membranous glomerulonephritis (40%).
Features of nephritic and nephroic syndromes have been
contrasted in Table 22.7.
III.ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. As already described above,
acute renal failure (ARF) is characterised by rapid decline in
renal function. ARF has many causes including glomerular
disease, principally rapidly progressive GN and acute diffuse
proliferative GN.
IV.CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE. Glomerular causes of
chronic renal failure (CRF) have already been described.
These cases have advanced renal impairment progressing
over years and is detected by significant proteinuria,
haematuria, hypertension and azotaemia. Such patients
generally have small contracted kidneys due to chronic
glomerulonephritis.
V. ASYMPTOMATIC PROTEINURIA. Presence of
proteinuria unexpectedly in a patient may be unrelated to
renal disease (e.g. exercise-induced, extreme lordosis and
orthostatic proteinuria), or may indicate an underlying mild
glomerulonephritis. Association of asymptomatic
haematuria, hypertension or impaired renal function with
asymptomatic proteinuria should raise strong suspicion of
underlying glomerulonephritis.
VI. ASYMPTOMATIC  HAEMATURIA. Asymptomatic
microscopic haematuria is common in children and young

adolescents and has many diverse causes such as diseases
of the glomerulus, renal interstitium, calyceal system, ureter,
bladder, prostate, urethra, and underlying bleeding disorder,
congenital abnormalities of the kidneys or neoplasia.
Glomerular haematuria is indicated by the presence of red
blood cells, red cell casts and haemoglobin in the urine.
Glomerular haematuria is frequently associated with
asymptomatic proteinuria.
PATHOGENESIS OF GLOMERULAR INJURY
Most forms of primary GN and many of the secondary
glomerular diseases in human beings have immunologic
pathogenesis. This view is largely based on immuno-
fluorescence studies of GN in humans which have revealed
glomerular deposits of immunoglobulins and complement
in patterns that closely resemble those of experimental
models. The consequences of injury at different sites within
the glomerulus in various glomerular diseases can be
assessed when compared with the normal physiologic role
of the main cells involved i.e. endothelial, mesangial, visceral
epithelial, and parietal epithelial cells as well as of the GBM  as
summed up in Table 22.8.
Immunologic mechanisms underlying glomerular
injury are primarily antibody-mediated (immune-complex
disease). There is evidence to suggest that cell-mediated
immune reactions in the form of delayed type hypersensiti-
vity can also cause glomerular injury in some situations.
In addition, a few secondary mechanisms and some non-
immunologic mechanisms are involved in the pathogene-
sis of some forms of glomerular diseases in human beings
(Table 22.9).
I.
IMMUNOLOGIC MECHANISMS
Experimental studies and observations in humans have
revealed that immunologic mechanisms, most importantly
antigen-antibody complexes, underlie most forms of
glomerular injury. The general principles of these
mechanisms in different forms of glomerular diseases are
discussed below, while specific features pertaining to
individual types of GN are described separately later.
A. Antibody-Mediated Glomerular Injury
1.
IMMUNE COMPLEX DISEASE. Majority of cases of
glomerular disease result from deposits of immune
complexes (antigen-antibody complexes). The immune
complexes are represented by irregular or granular glomer-
ular deposits of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM and IgA) and
complement (mainly C3). Based on the experimental models
and studies in human beings, the following 3 patterns of
glomerular deposits of immune complexes in various
glomerular diseases have been observed as illustrated in
Fig. 22.10:
i)
Exclusive mesangial deposits are characterised by very mild
form of glomerular disease.
ii) Extensive subendothelial deposits along the GBM are
accompanied by severe hypercellular sclerosing glomerular
lesions.

iii) Subepithelial deposits are seen between the outer surface
of the GBM and the podocytes.
Deposits may be located at one or more of the above sites
in any case of glomerular injury.
It was widely believed earlier that glomerular deposits
result from circulating immune complexes. Now, it has been
shown that glomerular deposits are formed by one of the
following two mechanisms:
i)
Local immune complex deposits. Formation of
glomerular deposits of immune complex in situ occurs as a
result of combination of antibodies with autologous non-
basement membrane antigens or nonglomerular antigens
planted on glomeruli. Currently, this mechanism is
considered responsible for most cases of immune complex
GN. Classic experimental model of in situ immune complex
GN is Heymann nephritis (autologous immune complex
nephritis) induced in rats by immunising animals with
homologous preparations of proximal tubular brush border.
The rats develop antibodies to brush border antigens and
thereby membranous GN that closely resembles human

membranous GN. The examples of planted non-glomerular
antigens are cationic proteins, lectins, DNA, bacterial products
(e.g. a protein of group A streptococci), viral and parasitic
products and drugs.
ii) Circulating immune complex deposits. This mechanism
used to be considered very important for glomerular injury
but now it is believed that circulating immune complexes
cause glomerular damage under certain circumstances only.
These situations are: their presence in high concentrations
for prolonged periods, or when they possess special
properties that cause their binding to glomeruli, or when host
mechanisms are defective and fail to eliminate immune
complexes. The antigens evoking antibody response may be
endogenous (e.g. in SLE) or may be exogenous (e.g. Hepatitis
B virus, Treponema pallidum, Plasmodium falciparum and
various tumour antigens). The antigen-antibody complexes
are formed in the circulation and then trapped in the
glomeruli where they produce glomerular injury after
combining with complement.
Immune complex GN is observed in the following human
diseases:
i)
Primary GN e.g. acute diffuse proliferative GN, memb-
ranous GN, membranoproliferative GN, IgA nephropathy
and some cases of rapidly progressive GN and focal GN.
ii) Systemic diseases e.g. glomerular disease in SLE, malaria,
syphilis, hepatitis, Henoch-Schonlein purpura and idiopathic
mixed cryoglobulinaemia.
2.
ANTI-GBM DISEASE. Less than 5% cases of human GN
are associated with anti-GBM antibodies. The constituent of
GBM acting as antigen appears to be a component of collagen
IV of the basement membrane. The experimental model of
anti-GBM disease is Masugi nephritis (nephrotoxic serum
nephritis) produced in rats by injection of heterologous
antibodies against GBM prepared in rabbits by immunisation
with rat kidney glomerular tissue.
Anti-GBM disease is classically characterised by
interrupted linear deposits of anti-GBM antibodies (mostly IgG;
rarely IgA and IgM) and complement (mainly C3) along the
glomerular basement membrane. These deposits are detected
by immunofluorescence microscopy or by electron
microscopy.
Anti-GBM disease is characteristically exemplified by
glomerular injury in Goodpasture’s syndrome in some cases
of rapidly progressive GN. About half to two-third of the
patients with renal lesions in Goodpasture’s syndrome have
pulmonary haemorrhage mediated by cross-reacting
autoantibodies against alveolar basement membrane (page
494).
3.
ALTERNATE PATHWAY DISEASE. As apparent from
the above mechanisms, the complement system, in
particular C3, contributes to glomerular injury in most
forms of GN. Deposits of C3 are associated with the early
components C1, C2 and C4 which are evidence of classic
pathway activation of complement. But in alternate
pathway activation, there is decreased serum C3 level,
decreased serum levels of factor B and properdin, normal
serum levels of C1, C2 and C4 but C3 and properdin are
found deposited in the glomeruli without immunoglobulin
deposits, reflecting activation of alternate pathway of
complement. Such patients have circulating anti-comple-
mentary nephritic factor (C3NeF) which is an IgG antibody
and acts as an autoantibody to the alternate C3 convertase,
leading to persistent alternate pathway activation.
The deposits in alternate pathway disease are charac-
teristically electron-dense under electron microscopy;
glomerular lesions in such cases are referred to as dense-
deposit disease.
Alternate pathway disease occurs in most cases of type
II membranoproliferative GN, some patients of rapidly
progressive GN, acute diffuse proliferative GN, IgA
nephropathy and in SLE.
4.
OTHER MECHANISMS OF ANTIBODY-MEDIATED
INJURY. A few autoantibodies have been implicated in some
patients of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and few other
types of GN. These antibodies include the following:
i)
Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). About
40% cases of rapidly progressive GN are deficient in
immunoglobulins in glomeruli (pauciimmune GN) and are
positive for ANCA against neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens
in their circulation. ANCA causes endothelial injury by
generation of reactive oxygen radicals. ANCA-mediated
vasculitis is also seen in Wegenger’s granulomatosis and
Churg-Strauss syndrome.
ii) Anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECA). Auto-
antibodies against endothelial antigens have been detected
in circulation in several inflammatory vasculitis and
glomerulonephritis. These antibodies increase the
adhesiveness of leucocytes to endothelial cells.
B. Cell-mediated Glomerular Injury
(Delayed-type Hypersensitivity)
There is evidence to suggest that cell-mediated immune
reactions may be involved in causing glomerular injury,
particularly in cases with deficient immunoglobulins (e.g.
in pauci-immune type glomerulonephritis in RPGN).
Cytokines and other mediators released by activated T cells
stimulate cytotoxicity, recruitment of more leucocytes and
fibrogenesis. CD4+ T lymphocytes recruit more macrophages
while CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells
cause further glomerular cell injury by antibody-dependent
cell toxicity. Soluble factor derived from T lymphocytes is
implicated in proteinuria in minimal change disease and focal
GS.
However, cell-mediated injury is yet less clear than
antibody-mediated glomerular injury.
C. Secondary Pathogenetic Mechanisms
(Mediators of Immunologic Injury)
Secondary pathogenetic mechanisms are a number of
mediators of immunologic glomerular injury operating in
man and in experimental models. These include the
following:
1.
NEUTROPHILS. Neutrophils are conspicuous in certain
forms of glomerular disease such as in acute diffuse prolife-
rative GN, and may also be present in membranoproliferative

665
CHAPTER 22
The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tract
GN and lupus nephritis. Neutrophils can mediate glomerular
injury by activation of complement as well as by release of
proteases, arachidonic acid metabolites and oxygen-derived
free radicals. These agents cause degradation of GBM and
cell injury.
2.
MONONUCLEAR PHAGOCYTES. Many forms of
human and experimental proliferative GN are associated
with glomerular infiltration by monocytes and macrophages.
Accumulation of mononuclear phagocytes is considered an
important constituent of hypercellularity in these forms of
GN aside from proliferation of mesangial and endothelial
cells. Activated macrophages release a variety of biologically
active substances which take part in glomerular injury.
3.
COMPLEMENT SYSTEM. The pathogenetic role of
classical and alternate pathway of activation of complement
has already been highlighted above. Besides the components
of complement which mediate glomerular injury via
neutrophils already mentioned, C5bC6789 (MAC, acronym
for membrane attack complex, also called terminal complex)
is capable of inducing damage to GBM directly.
4.
PLATELETS. Platelet aggregation and release of
mediators play a role in the evolution of some forms of GN.
Increased intrarenal platelet consumption has been found to
occur in some forms of glomerular disease.
5.
MESANGIAL CELLS. There is evidence to suggest that
mesangial cells present in the glomeruli may be stimulated
to produce mediators of inflammation and take part in
glomerular injury.
6.
COAGULATION SYSTEM. The presence of fibrin in
early crescents in certain forms of human and experimental
GN suggests the role of coagulation system in glomerular
damage. Fibrinogen may leak into Bowman’s space and act
as stimulus for cell proliferation. Crescents usually transform
into scar tissue under the influence of fibronectin which is
regularly present in crescents in human glomerular disease.
II. NON-IMMUNOLOGIC MECHANISMS
Though most forms of GN are mediated by immunologic
mechanisms, a few examples of glomerular injury by non-
immunologic mechanisms are found:
1.
Metabolic glomerular injury e.g. in diabetic nephropathy
(due to hyperglycaemia), Fabry’s disease (due to sulfatidosis).
2.
Haemodynamic glomerular injury e.g. systemic hyper-
tension, intraglomerular hypertension in FSGS.
3.
Deposition diseases e.g. amyloidosis.
4.
Infectious diseases e.g. HBV, HCV, HIV, E. coli-derived
nephrotoxin.
5. Drugs e.g. minimal change disease due to NSAIDs.
6.
Inherited glomerular diseases e.g. Alport’s syndrome, nail-
patella syndrome.
The evolution of end-stage renal failure in glomerular injury
is explained on the basis of adaptive glomerular hypertrophy
of unaffected glomeruli that results in increased glomerular
blood flow and increased glomerular capillary pressure
inducing intraglomerular hypertension. These events lead
to increased deposition of mesangial matrix and proliferation
of mesangial cells, endothelial and epithelial cell injury, and
eventually to progressive glomerulosclerosis and end-stage
renal failure.
SPECIFIC  TYPES OF GLOMERULAR DISEASES
Classification of different forms of glomerular diseases is
already presented in Table 22.4. Features of individual types
are described below and a summary of major forms of
primary glomerulonephritis is given in Table 22.11 at the
end of this discussion.
I.
PRIMARY GLOMERULONEPHRITIS
Acute Glomerulonephritis
(Synonyms: Acute Diffuse Proliferative GN,
Diffuse Endocapillary GN)
Acute GN is known to follow acute infection and charac-
teristically presents as acute nephritic syndrome. Based on
etiologic agent, acute GN is subdivided into 2 main groups:
acute post-streptococcal GN and acute non-streptococcal GN,
the former being more common.
ACUTE POST-STREPTOCOCCAL GN
Acute post-streptococcal GN, though uncommon and
sporadic in the Western countries, is a common form of GN
in developing countries, mostly affecting children between
2 to 14 years of age but 10% cases are seen in adults above 40
years of age. The onset of disease is generally sudden after
1-2 weeks of streptococcal infection, most frequently of the
throat (e.g. streptococcal pharyngitis) and sometimes of the
skin (e.g. streptococcal impetigo).
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The relationship between
streptococcal infection and this form of GN is now well
established. Particularly nephritogenic are types 12,4,1 and
Red Lake of group A β-haemolytic streptococci (compare the
etiologic agent with that of RHD, page 438). The glomerular
lesions appear to result from deposition of immune
complexes in the glomeruli. The evidences cited in support
are as under:
i)
There is epidemiological evidence of preceding strepto-
coccal sore throat or skin infection about 1-2 weeks prior to
the attack.
ii) The latent period between streptococcal infection and onset
of clinical manifestations of the disease is compatible with
the period required for building up of antibodies.
iii) Streptococcal infection may be identified by culture or
may be inferred from elevated titres of antibodies against
streptococcal antigens. These include the following:
anti-streptolysin O (ASO);
anti-deoxyribonuclease B (anti-DNAse B);
anti-streptokinase (ASKase);
anti-nicotinyl adenine dinucleotidase (anti-NADase); and
anti-hyaluronidase (AHase).
iv) There is usually hypocomplementaemia indicating
involvement of complement in the glomerular deposits.
v) It has also been possible to identify antigenic component
of streptococci which is cytoplasmic antigen, endostreptosin.

666
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the kidneys are
symmetrically enlarged, weighing one and a half to twice
the normal weight. The cortical as well as sectioned surface
show petechial haemorrhages giving the characteristic
appearance of flea-bitten kidney (Fig. 22.11).
Light microscopic findings are as under (Fig. 22.12):
i)
Glomeruli—The glomeruli are affected diffusely. They
are enlarged and hypercellular. The diffuse hyper-
cellularity of the tuft is due to proliferation of mesangial,
endothelial and occasionally epithelial cells (acute
proliferative lesions) as well as by infiltration of leucocytes,
chiefly polymorphs and sometimes monocytes (acute
exudative lesion). There may be small deposits of fibrin
within the capillary lumina and in the mesangium.
ii) Tubules—Tubular changes are not very striking.
There may be swelling and hyaline droplets in tubular
cells, and tubular lumina may contain red cell casts.
iii) Interstitium—There may be some degree of interstitial
oedema and leucocytic infiltration.
iv) Vessels—Changes in arteries and arterioles are seldom
present in acute GN.
Electron microscopic findings, aside from confirming the
light microscopic findings, demonstrate the characteristic
electron-dense irregular deposits (‘humps’) on the
epithelial side of the GBM. These deposits represent the
immune complexes (Fig. 22.13).
Immunofluorescence microscopy reveals that the irregular
deposits along the GBM consist principally of IgG and
complement C3.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Typically, the patient is a young
child, presenting with acute nephritic syndrome (page 660),
having sudden and abrupt onset following an episode of sore
throat or skin infection 1-2 weeks prior to the development
of symptoms. The features include microscopic or
intermittent haematuria, red cell casts, mild non-selective
proteinuria (less than 3 gm per 24 hrs), hypertension,
periorbital oedema and variably oliguria. Less often, the
presentation may be as nephrotic syndrome. In adults, the
features are atypical and include sudden hypertension,
oedema and azotaemia. Development of hypertension in
either case is a poor prognostic sign.
Prognosis varies with the age of the patient. Children
almost always (95%) recover completely with reversal of
proliferative glomerular changes. Complications arise more
often in adults and occasionally in children. These include
development of rapidly progressive GN, chronic GN,
uraemia and chronic renal failure.

667
CHAPTER 22
The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tract
ACUTE NON-STREPTOCOCCAL GN
About one-third cases of acute GN are caused by organisms
other than haemolytic streptococci. These include other
bacteria (e.g. staphylococci, pneumococci, meningococci,
Salmonella and Pseudomonas), viruses (e.g. hepatitis B virus,
mumps, infectious mononucleosis and varicella), parasitic
infections (e.g. malaria, toxoplasmosis and schistosomiasis)
and syphilis. The appearance of renal biopsy by light
microscopy, EM and immunofluorescence microscopy is
similar to that seen in acute post-streptococcal GN. The
prognosis of non-streptococcal GN is not as good as that of
streptococcal GN.
Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis
(Synonyms: RPGN, Crescentic GN, Extracapillary GN)
RPGN presents with an acute reduction in renal function
resulting in acute renal failure in a few weeks or months. It
is characterised by formation of ‘crescents’ (crescentic GN)
outside the glomerular capillaries (extracapillary GN).
‘Crescents’ are formed from the proliferation of parietal
epithelial cells lining Bowman’s capsule with contribution
from visceral epithelial cells and the invading mononuclear
cells. The stimulus for crescent formation appears to be the
presence of fibrin in the capsular space. RPGN occurs most
frequently in adults, with a slight male preponderance.
Prognosis of RPGN in general is dismal.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. A number of primary glomerular
and systemic diseases are characterised by formation of
crescents. Based on the etiologic agents and pathogenetic
mechanism, patients with RPGN are divided into 3 groups
(Table 22.10):
RPGN in systemic diseases (anti-GBM type);
post-infectious RPGN (immune-complex type); and
pauci-immune RPGN.
Following three serologic markers are used for
categorising RPGN:
i) serum C3 level,
ii) anti-GBM antibody; and
iii) anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA).
Type I RPGN: Anti-GBM disease. A number of systemic
diseases such as Goodpasture’s syndrome, SLE, vasculitis,
Wegener’s granulomatosis, Henoch-Schonlein purpura and
idiopathic mixed cryoglobulinaemia are associated with
crescentic GN. Goodpasture’s syndrome is the characteristic
example of anti-GBM disease and is described below:
Goodpasture’s syndrome. Goodpasture’s syndrome is
characterised by acute renal failure due to RPGN and
pulmonary haemorrhages (page 494). The condition is more
common in males in 3rd decade of life. The disease results
from damage to the glomeruli by anti-GBM antibodies which
cross-react with alveolar basement membrane and hence,
produce renal as well as pulmonary lesions. The evidences
in support are the characteristic linear deposits of anti-GBM
antibodies consisting of IgG and complement along the GBM,
detection of circulating anti-GBM antibodies and induction
of glomerular lesions with injection of anti-GBM antibodies
experimentally in monkeys. Pulmonary lesions can be experi-

mentally induced if the lungs are previously injured by viral
or bacterial infection or exposed to hydrocarbons. The
Goodpasture’s antigen appears to be a component of collagen
type IV.
Type II RPGN: Immune complex disease. A small propor-
tion of cases of post-streptococcal GN, particularly in adults
and sometimes of non-streptococcal origin, develop RPGN.
The evidences in support of post-infectious RPGN having
immune complex pathogenesis are granular deposits of
immune complexes of IgG and C3 along the glomerular
capillary walls, lowering of blood complement levels and
demonstration of circulating complexes.
Type III RPGN: Pauci-immune GN. These include cases of
Wegener’s granulomatosis and microscopic polyarteritis
nodosa. The pathogenesis of pauci-immune GN is yet not
fully defined. However, majority of these patients are ANCA-
positive, implying a defect in humoral immunity. Serum
complement levels are normal and anti-GBM antibody is
negative. There is little or no glomerular immune deposit
(i.e. pauci-immune).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the kidneys are
usually enlarged and pale with smooth outer surface (large
white kidney). Cut surface shows pale cortex and congested
medulla.
Light Microscopic findings vary according to the cause
but in general following features are present (Fig. 22.14):
i)
Glomeruli—Irrespective of the underlying etiology,
all forms of RPGN show pathognomonic ‘crescents’ on the
inside of Bowman’s capsules. These are collections of pale-
staining polygonal cells which commonly tend to be
elongated. Eventually, crescents obliterate the Bowman’s
space and compress the glomerular tuft. Fibrin deposition
is invariably present alongside crescents. Besides the
crescents, glomerular tufts may show increased cellularity
as a result of proliferation of endothelial and mesangial
cells and leucocytic infiltration. Fibrin thrombi are
frequently present in the glomerular tufts.
ii) Tubules—Tubular epithelial cells may show hyaline
droplets. Tubular lumina may contain casts, red blood
cells and fibrin.
iii) Interstitium—The interstitium is oedematous and
may show early fibrosis. Inflammatory cells, usually
lymphocytes and plasma cells, are commonly distributed
in the interstitial tissue.
iv) Vessels—Arteries and arterioles may show no change,
but cases associated with hypertension usually show
severe vascular changes.
Electron microscopic findings vary according to the type
of RPGN. Post-infectious RPGN cases show electron-dense
subepithelial granular deposits similar to those seen in
acute GN, while cases of RPGN in Goodpasture’s
syndrome show characteristic linear deposits along the
GBM (Fig. 22.15).
Immunofluorescence microscopy shows following
patterns in various types of RPGN:
linear pattern of RPGN in Goodpasture’s syndrome
(type I RPGN), containing IgG accompanied by C3 along
the capillaries.
Granular pattern of post-infectious RPGN (type II
RPGN) consisting of IgG and C3 along the capillary wall.
Scanty or no deposits of immunoglobulin and C3 in
pauci-immune GN (type III RPGN).
CLINICAL FEATURES. Generally, the features of post-
infectious RPGN are similar to those of acute GN, presenting
as acute renal failure. The patients of Goodpasture’s
syndrome may present as acute renal failure and/or
associated intrapulmonary haemorrhage producing
recurrent haemoptysis. Prognosis of all forms of RPGN is
poor. However, post-infectious cases have somewhat better
outcome and may show recovery.

CHAPTER 22
The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tract
Minimal Change Disease
(Synonyms: MCD, Lipoid Nephrosis, Foot Process
Disease, Nil Deposit Disease)
Minimal change disease   (MCD) is a condition in which the
nephrotic syndrome is accompanied by no apparent change
in glomeruli by light microscopy. Its other synonyms, lipoid
nephrosis and foot process disease, are descriptive terms for
fatty changes in the tubules and electron microscopic
appearance of flattened podocytes respectively. Minimal
change disease accounts for 80% cases of nephrotic syndrome
in children under 16 years of age with preponderance in boys
(ratio of boys to girls 2:1). In fact, historically, lipoid nephrosis
was the first condition associated with nephrotic sndrome.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The etiology of MCD remain
elusive. However, following two groups have been
identified:
i) Idiopathic (majority of cases).
ii) Cases associated with systemic diseases (Hodgkin’s
disease, HIV infection) and drug therapy (e.g. NSAIDs,
rifampicin, interferon-α).
The following features point to possible immunologic
pathogenesis for MCD:
i)
Absence of deposits by immunofluorescence microscopy.
ii) Normal circulating levels of complement but presence
of circulating immune complexes in many cases.
iii) Universal satisfactory response to steroid therapy.
iv) Evidence of increased suppressor T cell activity with
elaboration of cytokines (interleukin-8, tumour necrosis
factor) which probably cause foot process flattening and
altered charge on the GBM.
v) Detection of a mutation in nephrin gene in cases of
congenital MCD has focused attention on genetic basis.
Nephrotic syndrome in MCD in children is characterised
by selective proteinuria containing mainly albumin, and
minimal amounts of high molecular weight proteins such as
α2-macroglobulin. The basis for selective proteinuria appears
to be as under:
i)
Reduction of normal negative charge on GBM (page 650)
due to loss of heparan sulfate proteoglycan from the GBM.
ii) Change in the shape of epithelial cells producing foot
process flattening due to reduction of sialoglycoprotein cell
coat.
Adults having MCD, however, have non-selective protein-
uria, suggesting more extensive membrane permeability
defect.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the kidneys are
of normal size and shape.
By light microscopy, the findings are as under
(Fig. 22.16,A):
i)
Glomeruli—The most characteristic feature is no
apparent abnormality in the glomeruli except for slight
increase in the mesangial matrix at the most (minimal
change disease or nil lesion).
ii) Tubules—There is presence of fine lipid vacuolation
and hyaline droplets in the cells of proximal convoluted
tubules and, hence, the older name of the condition as
‘lipoid nephrosis’.
iii) Interstitium—There may be oedema of the
interstitium.
iv) Vessels—Blood vessels do not show any significant
change.
By electron microscopy, the most characteristic feature of
the disease is identified which is diffuse flattening of foot
processes of the visceral epithelial cells (podocytes) and,
hence, the name foot process disease or podocytopathy
(Fig. 22.16,B). Unlike other forms of GN, no deposits are
seen and the GBM is normal.
By immunofluorescence microscopy, no deposits of
complement or immunoglobulins are recognised (nil
deposit disease).
CLINICAL FEATURES. The classical presentation of MCD
is of fully-developed nephrotic syndrome with massive and
highly selective proteinuria, but hypertension is unusual. Most
frequently, the patients are children under 16 years (peak
incidence at 6-8 years of age).
The onset may be preceded by an upper respiratory
infection, atopic allergy or immunisation.
The disease characteristically responds to steroid therapy.
In spite of remissions and relapses, long-term prognosis is
very good and most children become free of albuminuria
after several years.
Membranous Glomerulonephritis
(Synonym: Epimembranous Nephropathy)
Membranous GN is characterised by widespread thickening
of the glomerular capillary wall and is the most common
cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. In majority of cases
(85%), membranous GN is truly idiopathic, while in about
15% of cases it is secondary to an underlying condition (e.g.
Figure 22.15
RPGN, diagrammatic representation of ultrastructure
of a portion of glomerular lobule showing epithelial crescent formation
and subepithelial granular deposits.

670
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
SLE, malignancies, infections such as chronic hepatitis B and
C, syphilis, malaria and drugs).
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Idiopathic membranous GN is an
immune complex disease. The deposits of immune complex
are formed locally because circulating immune complexes
are detected in less than a quarter of cases. Since leucocytic
infiltration is not a feature of membranous GN, damage to
the GBM is mediated directly by complement. While
nephritogenic antigen against which autoantibodies are
formed in idiopathic membranous GN is not known yet, the
antigen in cases of secondary membranous GN is either an
endogenous (e.g. DNA in SLE) or exogenous one (e.g.
hepatitis B virus, tumour antigen, treponema antigen, drug
therapy with penicillamine). Currently, pathogenesis of
membrane alteration in membranous GN is believed to be
by MAC (membrane attack complex i.e. C35b-C9) terminal
complex on podocytes.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the kidneys are
enlarged, pale and smooth.
Light microscopy shows the following findings
(Fig. 22.17):
i)
Glomeruli—The characteristic finding is diffuse
thickening of the glomerular capillary walls with all the
glomeruli being affected more or less uniformly. As the
disease progresses, the deposits are incorporated into
enormously thickened basement membrane, producing
‘duplication’ of GBM which is actually formation of a new
basement membrane. These basement membrane changes
are best appreciated by silver impregnation stains (black
colour) or by periodic acid-Schiff stain (pink colour). There
is no cellular proliferation in the glomerular tufts.
ii) Tubules—The renal tubules remain normal except in
the early stage when lipid vacuolation of the proximal
convoluted tubules may be seen.

proteinaceous material. B, Diagrammatic representation of ultrastructure  of a portion of glomerular lobule showing diffuse fusion or flattening of foot
processes of visceral epithelial cells (podocytes). The GBM is normal and there are no deposits.

to duplication of the GBM.

671
CHAPTER 22
The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tract
iii) Interstitium—The interstitium may show fine fibrosis
and scanty chronic inflammatory cells.
iv) Vessels—In the early stage, vascular changes are not
prominent, while later hypertensive changes of arterioles
may occur.
Electron microscopy shows characteristic electron-dense
deposits in subepithelial location. The basement
membrane material protrudes between deposits as ‘spikes’
(Fig. 22.18).
Immunofluorescence microscopy reveals granular deposits
of immune complexes consisting of IgG associated with
complement C3. In secondary cases of membranous GN
the relevant antigen such as hepatitis B or tumour antigen
may be seen.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The presentation in majority of
cases is insidious onset of nephrotic syndrome in an adult.
The proteinuria is usually of non-selective type. In addition,
microscopic haematuria and hypertension may be present
at the onset or may develop during the course of the disease.
The changes in membranous GN are irreversible in majority
of patients. Progression to impaired renal function and end-
stage renal disease with progressive azotaemia occurs in
approximately 50% cases within a span of 2 to 20 years. Renal
vein thrombosis has been found to develop in patients with
membranous GN due to hypercoagulability. The role and
beneficial effects of steroid therapy with or without the
addition of immunosuppressive drugs is debatable.
Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis
(Synonyms: MPGN, Mesangiocapillary GN)
Membranoproliferative GN is another important cause of
nephrotic syndrome in children and young adults. As the
name implies, it is characterised by two histologic features—
increase in cellularity of the mesangium associated with
increased lobulation of the tuft, and irregular thickening of
the capillary wall.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Etiology of MPGN is unknown
though in some cases there is evidence of preceding
streptococcal infection. Based on ultrastructural,
immunofluorescence and pathogenetic mechanisms, three
types of MPGN are recognised:
Type I or classic form is an example of immune complex
disease and comprises more than 70% cases. It is charac-
terised by immune deposits in the subendothelial position.
Immune-complex MPGN is seen in association with systemic
immune-complex diseases (e.g. SLE, mixed cryoglo-
bulinaemia, Sjögren’s syndrome), chronic infections (e.g.
bacterial endocarditis, HIV, hepatitis B and C) and
malignancies (e.g. lymphomas and leukaemias).
Type II or dense deposit disease is the example of alter-
nate pathway disease (page 664) and constitutes about 30%
cases. The capillary wall thickening is due to the deposition
of electron-dense material in the lamina densa of the GBM.
Type II MPGN is an autoimmune disease in which patients
have IgG autoantibody termed C3 nephritic factor. Type II
cases have an association with partial lipodystrophy, an
unusual condition of unknown pathogenesis characterised
by symmetrical loss of subcutaneous fat from the upper half
of the body.
Type III is rare and shows features of type I MPGN and
membranous nephropathy in association with systemic
diseases or drugs.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly and by light
microscopy, all the three types of MPGN are similar.
Grossly, the kidneys are usually pale in appearance and
firm in consistency.
By light microscopy, the features are as under (Fig. 22.19):
i)
Glomeruli—Glomeruli show highly characteristic
changes. They are enlarged with accentuated lobular
pattern. The enlargement is due to variable degree of
mesangial cellular proliferation and increase in mesangial
matrix. The GBM is considerably thickened, which with
silver stains shows two basement membranes with a clear
zone between them. This is commonly referred to as
‘double contour’, splitting, or ‘tram track’ appearance.
ii) Tubules—Tubular cells may show vacuolation and
hyaline droplets.
iii) Interstitium—There may be scattered chronic
inflammatory cells and some finely granular foam cells
in the interstitium.
iv) Vessels—Vascular changes are prominent in cases in
which hypertension develops.
By electron microscopy and immunofluorescence micros-
copy, the changes are different in the three types of MPGN
(Fig. 22.20):
Type I: It shows electron-dense deposits in subendothelial
location conforming to immune-complex character of the
disease. These deposits reveal positive fluorescence for
C3 and slightly fainter staining for IgG.
Figure 22.18
Membranous GN, diagrammatic represent ation of
ultrastructure  of a portion of glomerular lobule showing subepithelial
deposits of electron-dense material so that the basement membrane
material protrudes between these deposit s.

672
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Type II: The hallmark of type II MPGN is the presence of
dense amorphous deposits within the lamina densa of the
GBM and in the mesangium. Immunofluorescence studies
reveal the universal presence of C3 and properdin in the
deposits but the immunoglobulins are usually absent.
Type III: This rare form has electron-dense deposits within
the GBM as well as in subendothelial and subepithelial
regions of the GBM. Immunofluorescence studies show
the presence of C3, IgG and IgM.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Clinically, there are many
similarities between the main forms of MPGN. The most
common age at diagnosis is between 15 and 20 years.
Approximately 50% of the patients present with nephrotic
syndrome; about 30% have asymptomatic proteinuria; and
20% have nephritic syndrome at presentation. The
proteinuria is non-selective. Haematuria and hypertension
are frequently present. Hypocomplementaemia is a common
feature. With time, majority of patients progress to renal
failure, while some continue to have proteinuria, haematuria
and hypertension with stable renal function.
Prognosis of type I is relatively better and majority of
patients survive without clinically significant impairment of
GFR, while type II cases run a variable clinical course.
Focal Proliferative Glomerulonephritis
(Synonym:  Mesangial Proliferative GN)
Focal proliferative GN is characterised by pathologic changes
in certain number of glomeruli (focal), and often confined to
one or two lobules of the affected glomeruli (segmental), while
other glomeruli are normal. Focal GN is, thus, a pathologic
diagnosis.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. It may occur under following
diverse clinical settings:
As an early manifestation of a number of systemic diseases
such as SLE, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, subacute bacterial
endocarditis, Wegener’s granulomatosis, and polyarteritis
nodosa, Goodpasture’s syndrome.
As a component of a known renal disease such as in IgA
nephropathy.
As a primary idiopathic glomerular disease unrelated to
systemic or other renal disease.
The diverse settings under which focal GN is encountered
make it unlikely that there are common etiologic agents or
pathogenetic mechanisms. However, the observation of
mesangial deposits of immunoglobulins and complement
suggest immune complex disease and participation of the
mesangium.
Figure 22.19

There is increase in the mesangial matrix between the capillaries. There is widespread thickening of the GBM.

of a portion of glomerular lobule showing features of type I (left half) and

disease) is characterised by intramembranous dense deposit s.

673
CHAPTER 22
The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tract
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. By light microscopy, the
single most important feature in focal GN is the
abnormality seen in certain number of glomeruli and
generally confined to one or two lobules of the affected
glomeruli i.e. focal and segmental glomerular involvement
(Fig. 22.21,A). The pathologic change most frequently
consists of focal and segmental cellular proliferation of
mesangial cells and endothelial cells but sometimes
necrotising changes can be seen. The condition must be
distinguished from focal and segmental glomerulo-
sclerosis (discussed below).
By immunofluorescence microscopy, widespread
mesangial deposits of immunoglobulins (mainly IgA with
or without IgG), complement (C3) and fibrin are
demonstrated in most cases of focal GN.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The clinical features vary according
to the condition causing it. Haematuria is one of the most
common clinical manifestation. Proteinuria is frequently mild
to moderate but hypertension is uncommon.
Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis
(Synonyms: Focal Sclerosis, Focal Hyalinosis)
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a condition in
which there is sclerosis and hyalinosis of some glomeruli and
portions of their tuft (less than 50% in a tissue section), while
the other glomeruli are normal by light microscopy i.e.
involvement is focal and segmental. The incidence of FSGS
has increased over the last decades and is currently
responsible for about one-third cases of nephrotic syndrome
in the adults.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. FSGS was previously believed to
be a variant of MCD with accentuation of epithelial damage
in the form of hyalinosis and sclerosis. Currently, the
condition is divided into 3 groups:
i)
Idiopathic type. This group comprises majority of cases.
It is found in children and young adults with presentation
of nephrotic syndrome. It differs from minimal change
disease in having non-selective proteinuria, in being steroid-
resistant, and may progress to chronic renal failure. Immuno-
fluorescence microscopy reveals deposits of IgM and C3 in
the sclerotic segment.
ii) With superimposed primary glomerular disease. There
may be cases of FSGS with superimposed MCD or IgA
nephropathy. Those associated with MCD show good
response to steroid therapy and progression to chronic renal
failure may occur after a long time.
iii) Secondary type. This group consists of focal segmental
sclerotic lesions as a secondary manifestation of certain
diseases such as HIV, diabetes mellitus, reflux nephropathy,
heroin abuse and analgesic nephropathy.
The hallmark of pathogenesis of FSGS is injury to visceral
epithelial cells that results in disruption of visceral epithelial
cells and resultant nephron loss.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. By light microscopy,
depending upon the severity of the disease, variable
number of glomeruli are affected focally and segmentally,
while others are normal. The affected glomeruli show
solidification or sclerosis of one or more lobules of the tuft.
Hyalinosis refers to collection of eosinophilic,
homogeneous, PAS-positive, hyaline material present on
the inner aspect of a sclerotic peripheral capillary loop.
Mesangial hypercellularity is present in appreciable
number of cases. In addition, to glomerular changes, there
is interstitial fibrosis and infiltration by mononuclear
Figure 22.21
A, Focal GN. The characteristic feature is the cellular proliferation in some glomeruli and in one or two lobules of the affected
glomeruli i.e. focal and segmental proliferative change. B, C,  Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The features are focal and segmental involvement
of the glomeruli by sclerosis and hyalinosis and mesangial hypercellularity .

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
leucocytes, and tubular epithelial cell atrophy and
degeneration (Fig. 22.21,B, C).
Besides the lesions of focal and segmental scarring, a
variant of FSGS, collapsing glomerulopathy, has been
described in HIV patients. It is segmental or global
glomerular collapse of the tuft along with the presence of
hyperpasia and hypertrophy of podocytes producing a
pseudo-crescent and a rapid decline in renal function.
By electron microscopy, diffuse loss of foot processes
as seen in minimal change disease is evident but, in
addition, there are electron-dense deposits in the region
of hyalinosis and sclerosis which are believed to be
immune complexes.
By Immunofluorescence microscopy, the deposits in the
lesions are shown to contain IgM and C3.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The condition may affect all ages
including children and has male preponderance. The most
common presentation is in the form of nephrotic syndrome
with heavy proteinuria. Haematuria and hypertension tend
to occur more frequently than in minimal change disease.
Evidence of renal failure may be present at the onset.
IgA Nephropathy
(Synonyms: Berger’s Disease, IgA GN)
IgA nephropathy is emerging as the most common form of
glomerulopathy worldwide and its incidence has been rising.
It is characterised by aggregates of IgA, deposited principally
in the mesangium. The condition was first described by
Berger, a French physician in 1968 (Not to be confused with
Buerger’s disease or thromboangiitis obliterans described by
an American pathologist in 1908 and discussed on page 404).
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The etiology of IgA nephropathy
remains unclear:
i) It is idiopathic in most cases.
ii) Seen as part of Henoch-Schonlein purpura.
iii) Association with chronic inflammation in various body
systems (e.g. chronic liver disease, inflammatory bowel
disease, interstitial pneumonitis, leprosy,  dermatitis
herpetiformis, uveitis, ankylosing spondylitis, Sjögren’s
syndrome, monoclonal IgA gammopathy).
Pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy is explained on the basis
of following mechanisms:
i)
In view of exclusive mesangial deposits of IgA and
elevated serum levels of IgA and IgA-immune complexes,
IgA nephropathy has been considered to arise from
entrapment of these complexes in the mesangium.
ii) There is absence of early components of the complement
but presence of C3 and properdin in the mesangial deposits,
which point towards activation of alternate complement
pathway.
iii) Since there is close association between mucosal
infections (e.g. of the respiratory, gastrointestinal or urinary
tract), it is suggested that IgA deposited in the mesangium
could be due to increased mucosal secretion of IgA.
iv) HLA-B35 association has been reported in some cases.
Another possibility is genetically-determined abnormality of
the immune system producing an increase in circulating IgA.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. By light microscopy, the
pattern of involvement varies. These include: focal
proliferative GN, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis,
membranoproliferative GN, and rarely RPGN.
By electron microscopy, finely granular electron-dense
deposits are seen in the mesangium.
By immunofluorescence microscopy, the diagnosis is
firmly established by demonstration of mesangial deposits
of IgA, with or without IgG, and usually with C3 and
properdin.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The disease is common in children
and young adults. The clinical picture is usually characterised
by recurrent bouts of haematuria that are often precipitated
by mucosal infections. Mild proteinuria is usually present
and occasionally nephrotic syndrome may develop.
Chronic Glomerulonephritis
(Synonym: End-Stage Kidney)
Chronic GN is the final stage of a variety of glomerular
diseases which result in irreversible impairment of renal
function. The conditions which may progress to chronic GN,
in descending order of frequency, are as under:
i)
Rapidly progressive GN (90%)
ii) Membranous GN (50%)
iii) Membranoproliferative GN (50%)
iv) Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (50%)
v) IgA nephropathy (40%)
vi) Acute post-streptococcal GN (1%).
However, about 20% cases of chronic GN are idiopathic
without evidence of preceding GN of any type.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the kidneys are
usually small and contracted weighing as low as 50 gm
each. The capsule is adherent to the cortex. The cortical
surface is generally diffusely granular (Fig. 22.22). On cut
section, the cortex is narrow and atrophic, while the
medulla is unremarkable.
Microscopically, the changes vary greatly depending
upon the underlying glomerular disease. In general, the
following changes are seen (Fig. 22.23).
i)
Glomeruli—Glomeruli are reduced in number and
most of those present show completely hyalinised tufts,
giving the appearance of acellular, eosinophilic masses
which are PAS-positive. Evidence of underlying
glomerular disease may be present.
ii) Tubules—Many tubules completely disappear and
there may be atrophy of tubules close to scarred glomeruli.
Tubular cells show hyaline-droplets, degeneration and
tubular lumina frequently contain eosinophilic,
homogeneous casts.
iii) Interstitium—There is fine and delicate fibrosis of the
interstitial tissue and varying number of chronic
inflammatory cells are often seen.
iv) Vessels—Advanced cases which are frequently
associated with hypertension show conspicuous arterial
and arteriolar sclerosis.

675
CHAPTER 22
The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tract
Patients of end-stage kidney disease on dialysis show
a variety of dialysis associated changes that include acqui-
red cystic disease (page 659), occurrence of adenomas and
adenocarcinomas of the kidney, calcification of tufts and
deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in tubules.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The patients are usually adults. The
terminal stage of chronic GN is characterised by
hypertension, uraemia and progressive deterioration of renal
function. Besides the primary changes due to chronic renal
failure, there are a variety of systemic manifestations of
uraemia (page 655). These patients eventually die if they do
not receive a renal transplant.
The salient features of various types of primary
glomerulonephritis are summarised in Table 22.11.
II. SECONDARY GLOMERULAR DISEASES
Glomerular involvement may occur secondary to certain
systemic diseases or a few hereditary diseases. In some of
these, renal involvement may be the initial presentation,
while in others clinical evidence of renal disease appears long
after other manifestations have appeared. A list of these
conditions has already been given in Table 22.4. The
important examples are described below.
Lupus Nephritis
Renal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
are termed lupus nephritis. Other clinical manifestations,
etiology and pathogenesis of this multi-system autoimmune
disease are described in Chapter 4 (page 78). The incidence
of renal involvement in SLE ranges from 40 to 75%. The two
cardinal clinical manifestations of lupus nephritis are
proteinuria and haematuria. In addition, hypertension and
casts of different types such as red cell casts, fatty casts and
leucocyte casts in the urinary sediment are found.
Pathogenesis of lesions in lupus nephritis is linked to
genes related to major histocompatibility complex and B-cell
signaling pathways such as TNF superfamily members.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. According to the WHO,
six patterns of mutually-merging renal lesions are seen in
lupus nephritis (also refer to Table 4.9):
Class I: Minimal lesions. On light microscopy, these cases
do not show any abnormality. But examination by electron
microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy shows
deposits within the mesangium which consist of IgG and
C3.
Class II: Mesangial lupus nephritis. These cases have
mild clinical manifestations. By light microscopy, there is
increase in the number of mesangial cells and of mesangial
matrix. Ultrastructural and immunofluorescence studies
reveal granular mesangial deposits of IgG and C3; some-
times IgA and IgM are also present in the deposits.
Class III: Focal segmental lupus nephritis. This is
characterised by focal and segmental proliferation of
endothelial and mesangial cells, together with infiltration
by macrophages and sometimes neutrophils.
Haematoxylin bodies of Gross may be present.
Subendothelial and subepithelial deposits of IgG, often
with IgM or IgA and C3, are seen.
Class IV: Diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis. In this
type, all the morphologic manifestations of lupus are
present in most advanced form. This is the most severe

CHAPTER 22
The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tract
and the most common form of lupus nephritis. There is
diffuse proliferation of endothelial, mesangial, and
sometimes epithelial cells, involving most or all glomeruli.
Electron microscopy shows large electron-dense deposits
in the mesangium and in the subendothelial region which
on immunofluorescence are positive for IgG; sometimes
also for IgA or IgM, and C3.
Class V: Membranous lupus nephritis. These lesions
resemble those of idiopathic membranous GN. These
consist of diffuse thickening of glomerular capillary wall
on light microscopy and show subendothelial deposits of
immune complexes containing IgG, IgM and C3 on
ultrastructural studies. Mesangial hypercellularity is
present in some cases.
Class VI: Sclerosing lupus nephritis. This is end-stage
kidney of SLE, akin to chronic GN. Most glomeruli are
sclerosed and hyalinised and there may be remnants of
preceding lesions.
Although in a given case, the lesions in lupus nephririts
fit into one of the classes described above, it is not unusual
to find overlapping and progressive transformation of lupus
lesions during the course of disease.
Diabetic Nephropathy
Renal involvement is an important complication of diabetes
mellitus. End-stage kidney with renal failure accounts for
deaths in more than 10% of all diabetics. Renal complications
are more severe, develop early and more frequently in
type 1 (earlier called insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus
(30-40% cases) than in type 2 (earlier termed non-insulin-
dependent) diabetics  (about 20% cases). A variety of clinical
syndromes are associated with diabetic nephropathy that
includes asymptomatic proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome,
progressive renal failure and hypertension. Cardiovascular
disease is 40 times more common in patients of end-stage
renal disease in diabetes mellitus than in non-diabetics and
more diabetics die from cardiovascular complications than
from uraemia.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Diabetic nephropathy
encompasses 4 types of renal lesions in diabetes mellitus:
diabetic glomerulosclerosis, vascular lesions, diabetic
pyelonephritis and tubular lesions (Armanni-Ebstein
lesions).
1.
DIABETIC GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS. Glomerular
lesions in diabetes mellitus are particularly common and
account for majority of abnormal findings referable to the
kidney.
Pathogenesis of these lesions in diabetes mellitus is
explained by following sequential changes:  hyper-
glycaemia → glomerular hypertension → renal hyper-
perfusion → deposition of proteins in the mesangium →
glomerulosclerosis → renal failure. In addition, cellular
infiltration in renal lesions in diabetic glomerular lesions
is due to growth factors, particularly transforming growth
factor-β. Strict control of blood glucose level and control
of systemic hypertension in  these patients retards
progression to diabetic nephropathy.
Glomerulosclerosis in diabetes may take one of the 2
forms: diffuse or nodular lesions:
i)
Diffuse glomerulosclerosis. Diffuse glomerular
lesions are the most common. There is involvement of all
parts of glomeruli. The pathologic changes consist of
thickening of the GBM and diffuse increase in mesangial
matrix with mild proliferation of mesangial cells. Various
exudative lesions such as capsular hyaline drops and fibrin
caps may also be present (Fig. 22.24,A) Capsular drop is an
eosinophilic hyaline thickening of the parietal layer of
Bowman’s capsule and bulges into the glomerular space.
Figure 22.24
Diabetic glomerulosclerosis. A, Diffuse lesions. The characteristic features are dif fuse involvement of the glomeruli showing
thickening of the GBM and diffuse increase in the mesangial matrix with mild proliferation of mesangial cells and exudative lesions (fibrin caps and
capsular drops). B, Nodular lesion (Kimmelstiel-Wilson Lesion). There are one or more hyaline nodules within the lobules of glomeruli, surrounded
peripherally by glomerular capillaries with thickened walls.

678
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Fibrin cap is homogeneous, brightly eosinophilic material
appearing on the wall of a peripheral capillary of a lobule.
ii) Nodular glomerulosclerosis. Nodular lesions of
diabetic glomerulosclerosis are also called as Kimmelstiel-
Wilson (KW) lesions or intercapillary glomerulosclerosis.
These lesions are specific for type 1 diabetes (juvenile-
onset diabetes) or islet cell antibody-positive diabetes
mellitus. The pathologic changes consist of one or more
nodules in a few or many glomeruli. Nodule is an ovoid or
spherical, laminated, hyaline, acellular mass located
within a lobule of the glomerulus. The nodules are
surrounded peripherally by glomerular capillary loops
which may have normal or thickened GBM (Fig. 22.24,B).
The nodules are PAS-positive and contain lipid and fibrin.
As the nodular lesions enlarge, they compress the glomer-
ular capillaries and obliterate the glomerular tuft
(Fig. 22.25). As a result of glomerular and arteriolar
involvement, renal ischaemia occurs leading to tubular
atrophy and interstitial fibrosis and grossly small,
contracted kidney.
2.
VASCULAR LESIONS. Atheroma of renal arteries is
very common and severe in diabetes mellitus. Hyaline
arteriolosclerosis (Chapter 15) affecting the afferent and
efferent arterioles of the glomeruli is also often severe in
diabetes. These vascular lesions are responsible for renal
ischaemia that results in tubular atrophy and interstitial
fibrosis.
3.
DIABETIC PYELONEPHRITIS. Poorly-controlled
diabetics are particularly susceptible to bacterial infec-
tions. Papillary necrosis (necrotising papillitis) (page 682)
is an important complication of diabetes that may result
in acute pyelonephritis. Chronic pyelonephritis is 10 to
20 times more common in diabetics than in others.
4.
TUBULAR LESIONS (ARMANNI-EBSTEIN
LESIONS). In untreated diabetics who have extremely
high blood sugar level, the epithelial cells of the proximal
convoluted tubules develop extensive glycogen deposits
appearing as vacuoles. These are called Armanni-Ebstein
lesions. The tubules return to normal on control of
hyperglycaemic state.
Hereditary Nephritis
A group of hereditary diseases principally involving the
glomeruli are termed hereditary nephritis. These include the
following:
1.
Alport’s syndrome
2.
Fabry’s disease
3.
Nail-patella syndrome
1.
Alport’s syndrome. Out of various hereditary nephritis,
Alport’s syndrome is relatively more common and has been
extensively studied. This is an X-linked dominant disorder
having mutation in α−5 chain of type IV collagen located on
X-chromosome. It affects males more severely than females.
The syndrome consists of sensori-neural deafness and
ophthalmic complications (lens dislocation, posterior
cataracts and corneal dystrophy) associated with hereditary
nephritis. The condition is slowly progressive, terminating
in end-stage kidney in the 2nd to 3rd decades of life. The
common presenting features are persistent or recurrent
haematuria accompanied by erythrocyte casts, proteinuria
and hypertension.
By light microscopy, the glomeruli have predominant
involvement and show segmental proliferation of
mesangial cells with increased mesangial matrix and
occasional segmental sclerosis. Another prominent feature
is the presence of lipid-laden foam cells in the interstitium.
As the disease progresses, there is increasing sclerosis of
glomeruli, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis.
Electron microscopy reveals characteristic basement
membrane splitting or lamination in the affected parts of
glomeruli.
Immunofluorescence studies fail to show deposits of
immunoglobulins or complement components.
2.
Fabry’s disease, another hereditary nephritis is
characterised by accumulation of neutral glycosphingolipids
in lysosomes of glomerular, tubular, vascular and interstitial
cells.
3.
Nail-patella syndrome or osteonychodysplasia is a rare
hereditary disease having abnormality in α-1 chain of
collagen V on chromosome 9 associated with multiple
osseous defects of elbows, knees and nail dysplasia. About
half the cases develop nephropathy.
TUBULAR AND TUBULOINTERSTITIAL DISEASES
It is difficult to separate the involvement of the tubules and
the interstitium since most forms of tubular diseases also
involve the interstitium, while the tubules and interstitium
may be involved secondarily as a part of the diseases of other
renal components. For the purpose of present discussion, this
group of diseases is discussed under 2 headings:

or KW) lesions.

CHAPTER 22
The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tract
I. Primary tubular diseases that include tubular injury by
ischaemic or toxic agents i.e. acute tubular necrosis.
II. Tubulointerstitial diseases that include inflammatory
involvement of the tubules and the interstitium i.e.
tubulointerstitial nephritis.
ACUTE TUBULAR NECROSIS
Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is the term used for acute renal
failure (ARF) resulting from destruction of tubular epithe-
lial cells. ATN is the most common and most important cause
of ARF characterised by sudden cessation of renal function.
Various other causes of ARF (pre-renal, intra-renal and post-
renal) as well as the clinical syndrome accompanying ATN
(oliguric phase, diuretic phase and phase of recovery) are
described already on page 654. Based on etiology and
morphology, two forms of ATN are distinguished—
ischaemic and toxic; however both forms have a somewhat
common pathogenesis.
Pathogenesis of ATN
The pathogenesis of both types of ATN resulting in ARF is
explained on the basis of the following sequential mechanism
and is illustrated in Fig. 22.26:
i)
Renal tubules are highly susceptible to injury by ischaemia
and toxic agents.
ii) Tubular damage in ischaemic ATN is initiated by arteriolar
vasoconstriction induced by renin-angiotensin system, while
in toxic ATN by direct damage to tubules by the agent.
iii) Debris of the desquamated epithelium due to necrosis
causes tubular obstruction and may block urinary outflow with
consequent reduction of GFR and also produce casts in the
urine.
iv) These events cause increased intratubular pressure resulting
in damage to tubular basement membrane.
v) Due to increased intratubular pressure, there is tubular
rupture.
vi) Damage to tubules is accompanied with leakage of fluid
into the interstitium causing interstitial oedema.
vii)Leakage of tubular fluid into the interstitium increases
interstitial pressure.
viii) Leaked fluid incites host inflammatory response.
ix) Increased interstitial pressure causes compression of tubules
and blood vessels and setting up a vicious cycle of accentuated
ischaemia and necrosis.
x) Ultimately, it leads to reduced GFR and consequently
oliguria.
Ischaemic ATN
Ischaemic ATN, also called tubulorrhectic ATN, lower
(distal) nephron nephrosis, anoxic nephrosis, or shock
kidney, occurs due to hypoperfusion of the kidneys resulting
in focal damage to the distal parts of the convoluted tubules.
ETIOLOGY. Ischaemic ATN is more common than toxic
ATN and accounts for more than 80% cases of tubular injury.
Ischaemia may result from a variety of causes as follows:
1.
Shock (post-traumatic, surgical, burns, dehydration,
obstetrical and septic type).
2.
Crush injuries.
3.
Non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis induced by alcohol,
coma, muscle disease or extreme muscular exertion
(myoglobinuric nephrosis).
4.
Mismatched blood transfusions, black-water fever
(haemoglobinuric nephrosis).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the kidneys are
enlarged and swollen. On cut section, the cortex is often
widened and pale, while medulla is dark.
Histologically, predominant changes are seen in the
tubules, while glomeruli remain unaffected. The
interstitium shows oedema and mild chronic
inflammatory cell infiltrate. Tubular changes are as follows
(Fig. 22.27):
1.
Dilatation of the proximal and distal convoluted
tubules.
2.
Focal tubular necrosis at different points along the
nephron.
3.
Flattened epithelium lining the tubules suggesting
epithelial regeneration.
4.
Eosinophilic hyaline casts or pigmented haemoglobin
and myoglobin casts in the tubular lumina (Fig. 22.28).
5.
Disruption of tubular basement membrane adjacent
to the cast may occur (tubulorrhexis).
Figure 22.26
Pathogenesis of ATN.

680
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Prognosis of ischaemic ATN depends upon the underlying
etiology. In general, cases that follow severe trauma, surgical
procedures, extensive burns and sepsis have much worse
outlook than the others.
Toxic ATN
Toxic ATN, also called nephrotoxic ATN or toxic nephrosis
or upper (proximal) nephron nephrosis,  occurs as a result
of direct damage to tubules, more marked in proximal
portions, by ingestion, injection or inhalation of a number of
toxic agents.
ETIOLOGY. The toxic agents causing toxic ATN are as
under:
1.
General poisons such as mercuric chloride, carbon
tetrachloride, ethylene glycol, mushroom poisoning and
insecticides.
2.
Heavy metals (mercury, lead, arsenic, phosphorus and
gold).
3.
Drugs such as sulfonamides, certain antibiotics (genta-
mycin, cephalosporin), anaesthetic agents (methoxyflurane,
halothane), barbiturates, salicylates.
4.
Radiographic contrast material.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Poisoning with mercuric
chloride provides the classic example that produces
widespread and readily discernible tubular necrosis (acute
mercury nephropathy).
Grossly, the kidneys are enlarged and swollen. On cut
section, the cortex is pale and swollen, while the medulla
is slightly darker than normal.
Histologically, the appearance varies according to the
cause of toxic ATN but, in general, involves the segment
of tubule diffusely (unlike ischaemic ATN where the
involvement of nephron is focal). In mercuric chloride
poisoning, the features are as follows (Fig. 22.28):
1.
Epithelial cells of mainly proximal convoluted tubules
are necrotic and desquamated into the tubular lumina.
2.
The desquamated cells may undergo dystrophic
calcification.
3.
Tubular basement membrane is generally intact.
4.
The regenerating epithelium, which is flat and thin
with few mitoses, may be seen lining the tubular basement
membrane.
Prognosis of toxic ATN is good if there is no serious
damage to other organs such as heart and liver.
The contrasting features of the two forms of ATN are
presented in Table 22.12.
TUBULOINTERSTITIAL DISEASES
The term tubulointerstitial nephritis is used for inflammatory
process that predominantly involves the renal interstitial
tissue and is usually accompanied by some degree of tubular
damage. A number of primary glomerular, tubular, vascular
and obstructive diseases are secondarily associated with
interstitial reaction. However, the term interstitial nephritis is
reserved for those cases where there is no primary
involvement of glomeruli, tubules or blood vessels. The older
nomenclature, interstitial nephritis, is currently used syno-
nymously with tubulointerstitial nephritis or tubulointerstitial
nephropathy.
A number of bacterial and non-bacterial, acute and
chronic conditions may produce tubulointerstitial nephritis
and are listed in Table 22.13. The important and common
examples among these are discussed below.
Acute Pyelonephritis
Acute pyelonephritis is an acute suppurative inflammation
of the kidney caused by pyogenic bacteria.
Figure 22.27
Ischaemic ATN. There is focal necrosis along the
nephron involving proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) as well as distal
convoluted tubule (DCT). The affected tubules are dilated, their lumina
contain casts (hyaline or pigmented haem) and the affected regions are
lined by regenerating thin and flat epithelium.
Figure 22.28
Toxic ATN. There is extensive necrosis of epithelial
cells involving predominantly proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) diffusely.
The necrosed cells are desquamated into the tubular lumina and may
undergo dystrophic calcification. The tubular lumina cont ain casts
(granular) and the regenerating flat epithelium lines the necrosed tubule.

681
CHAPTER 22
The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tract
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Most cases of acute pyelonephritis
follow infection of the lower urinary tract. The most
common pathogenic organism in urinary tract infection
(UTI) is Escherichia coli (in 90% of cases), followed in
decreasing frequency, by Enterobacter, Klebsiella,
Pseudomonas and Proteus. The bacteria gain entry into the
urinary tract, and thence into the kidney by one of the two
routes: ascending infection and haematogenous infection
(Fig. 22.29):
1.
Ascending infection. This is the most common route of
infection. The common pathogenic organisms are inhabitants
of the colon and may cause faecal contamination of the
urethral orifice, especially in females in reproductive age
group. This has been variously attributed to shorter urethra
in females liable to faecal contamination, hormonal influences
facilitating bacterial adherence to the mucosa, absence of
prostatic secretions which have antibacterial properties, and
urethral trauma during sexual intercourse. The last named
produces what is appropriately labelled as ‘honeymoon
pyelitis’. Ascending infection may occur in a normal indi-
vidual but the susceptibility is increased in patients with
diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, urinary tract obstruction or
instrumentation. Bacteria multiply in the urinary bladder and
produce asymptomatic bacteriuria found in many of these
cases. After having caused urethritis and cystitis, the bacteria
in susceptible cases ascend further up into the ureters against
the flow of urine, extend into the renal pelvis and then the
renal cortex. The role of vesico-ureteral reflux is not of a great
significance in the pathogenesis of acute chronic pyelo-
nephritis as it is in chronic pyelonephritis.
2.
Haematogenous infection. Less often, acute pyelo-
nephritis may result from blood-borne spread of infection.
This occurs more often in patients with obstructive lesions

Systemic Pathology
in the urinary tract, and in debilitated or immunosuppressed
patients.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, well-developed
cases of acute pyelonephritis show enlarged and swollen
kidney that bulges on section. The cut surface shows small,
yellow-white abscesses with a haemorrhagic rim. These
abscesses may be several millimetres across and are
situated mainly in the cortex.
Microscopically, acute pyelonephritis is characterised by
extensive acute inflammation involving the interstitium
and causing destruction of the tubules. Generally, the
glomeruli and renal blood vessels show considerable
resistance to infection and are spared. The acute
inflammation may be in the form of large number of
neutrophils in the interstitial tissue and bursting into
tubules, or may form focal neutrophilic abscesses in the
renal parenchyma.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Classically, acute pyelonephritis has
an acute onset with chills, fever, loin pain, lumbar tenderness,
dysuria and frequency of micturition. Urine will show
bacteria in excess of 100,000/ml, pus cells and pus cell casts
in the urinary sediment. Institution of specific antibiotics,
after identification of bacteria by culture followed by
sensitivity test, eradicates the infection in majority of patients.
COMPLICATIONS. Complications of acute pyelonephritis
are encountered more often in patients with diabetes mellitus
or with urinary tract obstruction. Following are the three
important complications of acute pyelonephritis:
1.
Papillary necrosis. Papillary necrosis or necrotising
papillitis develops more commonly in analgesic abuse
nephropathy and in sickle cell disease but may occur as a
complication of acute pyelonephritis as well. It may affect
one or both kidneys.
Grossly, the necrotic papillae are yellow to grey-white,
sharply-defined areas with congested border and resemble
infarction. The pelvis may be dilated.
Microscopically, necrotic tissue is separated from the
viable tissue by a dense zone of polymorphs. The necrotic
area shows characteristic coagulative necrosis as seen in
renal infarcts.
2.
Pyonephrosis. Rarely, the abscesses in the kidney in
acute pyelonephritis are extensive, particularly in cases with
obstruction. This results in inability of the abscesses to drain
and this transforms the kidney into a multilocular sac
filled with pus called as pyonephrosis or renal carbuncle
(Fig. 22.30).
3.
Perinephric abscess. The abscesses in the kidney may
extend through the capsule of the kidney into the perinephric
tissue and form perinephric abscess.
Chronic Pyelonephritis
Chronic pyelonephritis is a chronic tubulointerstitial disease
resulting from repeated attacks of inflammation and scarring.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Depending upon the etiology and
pathogenesis, two types of chronic pyelonephritis are descri-
bed—reflux nephropathy and obstructive pyelonephritis
(Fig. 22.31):
1.
Reflux nephropathy. Reflux of urine from the bladder
into one or both the ureters during micturition is the major
cause of chronic pyelonephritis. Vesicoureteric reflux is
particularly common in children, especially in girls, due to
congenital absence or shortening of the intravesical portion
of the ureter so that ureter is not compressed during the act
of micturition. Reflux results in increase in pressure in the
renal pelvis so that the urine is forced into renal tubules which
is eventually followed by damage to the kidney and scar
formation (Fig. 22.29). Vesicoureteric reflux is more common
in patients with urinary tract infection, whether symptomatic
or asymptomatic, but reflux of sterile urine can also cause
renal damage.
2.
Obstructive pyelonephritis. Obstruction to the outflow
of urine at different levels predisposes the kidney to infection
(page 690). Recurrent episodes of such obstruction and
infection result in renal damage and scarring. Rarely,
recurrent attacks of acute pyelonephritis may cause renal
damage and scarring.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the kidneys show
rather characteristic appearance. The kidneys are usually
small and contracted (weighing less than 100 gm) showing
unequal reduction, which distinguishes it from other
forms of contracted kidney. The surface of the kidney is
irregularly scarred; the capsule can be stripped off with
difficulty due to adherence to scars. These scars are of
variable size and show characteristic U-shaped
depressions on the cortical surface. There is generally
blunting and dilatation of calyces (calyectasis) and dilated
pelvis of the kidney (Fig. 22.32).
Microscopically, predominant changes are seen in
interstitium and (Fig. 22.33):
Figure 22.30
Pyonephrosis. The kidney is enlarged and has
increased perinephric fat in the hilum. Sectioned surface shows markedly
dilated pelvis and calyces having irregular and ragged inner surface and
containing necrotic debris and pus.

683
CHAPTER 22
The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tract
i)
Interstitium—There is chronic interstitial inflam-
matory reaction, chiefly composed of lymphocytes,
plasma cells and macrophages with pronounced
interstitial fibrosis. Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is
an uncommon variant characterised by collection of foamy
macrophages admixed with other inflammatory cells and
giant cells.
ii) Tubules—The tubules show varying degree of
atrophy and dilatation. Dilated tubules may contain
eosinophilic colloid casts producing thyroidisation of
tubules. A few tubules may contain neutrophils.
iii) Pelvicalyceal system—The renal pelvis and calyces
are dilated. The walls of pelvis and calyces show marked
chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Lymphoid follicles
with germinal centres may be present in the pelvicalyceal
walls. The lining epithelium may undergo squamous
metaplastic change.
iv) Blood vessels—Blood vessels entrapped in the scarred
areas show obliterative endarteritis. There may be changes
of hypertensive hyaline arteriolosclerosis.
v) Glomeruli—Though glomerular tuft in the scarred
area is usually intact, there is often periglomerular fibrosis.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
In advanced cases, there may be hyalinisation of
glomeruli.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Chronic pyelonephritis often has
an insidious onset. The patients present with clinical picture
of chronic renal failure or with symptoms of hypertension.
Sometimes, the patients may present with features of acute
recurrent pyelonephritis with fever, loin pain, lumbar
tenderness, dysuria, pyouria, bacteriuria and frequency of
micturition. Diagnosis is made by intravenous pyelography
(IVP). Culture of the urine may give positive results.
Longstanding cases of chronic pyelonephritis may develop
secondary systemic amyloidosis.
Tuberculous Pyelonephritis
Tuberculosis of the kidney occurs due to haematogenous
spread of infection from another site, most often from the
lungs. Less commonly, it may result from ascending infection
from tuberculosis of the genitourinary system such as from
epididymis or Fallopian tubes. The renal lesions in
tuberculosis may be in the form of tuberculous pyelonephritis
or appear as multiple miliary tubercles.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the lesions in
tuberculous pyelonephritis are often bilateral, usually
involving the medulla with replacement of the papillae
by caseous tissue. Obstruction may result in tuberculous
pyonephrosis in which thinned out renal parenchyma
surrounds dilated pelvis and calyces filled with caseous
material.
Histologically, typical granulomatous reaction is seen.
Acid-fast bacilli can often be demonstrated in the lesions.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Most patients are young to middle-
aged adults. The clinical presentation is extremely variable
but it should always be considered as a possibility in a patient
in whom there is persistent sterile pyouria, microscopic
haematuria and mild proteinuria after effective antibiotic
therapy for urinary tract infection. The diagnosis rests on
identification of M. tuberculosis by repeated culture of urine
on L.J. media.
Myeloma Nephropathy
Renal involvement in multiple myeloma (Chapter 14) is
referred to as myeloma nephropathy or myeloma kidney.
Functional renal impairment in multiple myeloma is a
common manifestation, developing in about 50% of patients.
The pathogenesis of myeloma kidney is related to excess
filtration of Bence Jones proteins through the glomerulus,
usually kappa (κ) light chains. These light chain proteins are
precipitated in the distal convoluted tubules in combination
with Tamm-Horsfall proteins, the urinary glycoproteins. The
precipitates form tubular casts which are eosinophilic and
often laminated. These casts may induce peritubular inter-
stitial inflammatory reaction. Not all light chains are
nephrotoxic and their toxicity occurs under acidic pH of the
tubular fluid.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the kidneys may
be normal or small and shrunken.
Histologically, there are some areas of tubular atrophy
while many other tubular lumina are dilated and contain
characteristic bright pink laminated cracked or fractured
casts consisting of Bence-Jones proteins called fractured
casts. These casts are surrounded by peritubular
interstitial inflammatory reaction including the presence
of nonspecific inflammatory cells and some multinucleate
giant cells induced by tubular casts.
Nephrocalcinosis
Nephrocalcinosis is a diffuse deposition of calcium salts in
renal tissue in a number of renal diseases, in hypercalcaemia,
Figure 22.33
Chronic pyelonephritis. The scarred area shows atrophy of some tubules and dilat
ation of others which contain colloid cast s
(thyroidisation). The tubules are surrounded by abundant fibrous tissue and chronic interstitial inflammatory reaction. The blo od vessels included
are thick-walled and the glomeruli show periglomerular fibrosis.

685
CHAPTER 22
The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tract
hyperphosphataemia and renal tubular acidosis. Most
commonly, it develops as a complication of severe
hypercalcaemia such as due to hyperparathyroidism,
hypervitaminosis D, excessive bone destruction in metastatic
malignancy, hyperthyroidism, excessive calcium intake such
as in milk-alkali syndrome and sarcoidosis (page 53).
Clinically, patients of hypercalcaemia and nephrocalcinosis
may have renal colic, band keratopathy due to calcium
deposits in the cornea, visceral metastatic calcification,
polyuria and renal failure.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Nephrocalcinosis due to
hypercalcaemia characteristically shows deposition of
calcium in the tubular epithelial cells in the basement
membrane, within the mitochondria and in the cytoplasm.
These concretions may produce secondary tubular atro-
phy, interstitial fibrosis and nonspecific chronic inflamm-
ation in the interstitium. As the calcification occurs
intracellularly, radiological evidence is usually not present
until fairly late in the disease. The calcium deposits are
first visible as small opacities in the renal papillae.
RENAL VASCULAR DISEASES
Renal blood vessels which enormously perfuse the kidney
are affected secondarily in majority of renal diseases. Renal
blood flow is controlled by systemic and local haemo-
dynamic, hormonal and intrinsic intra-renal mechanisms.
Diseases which disturb these controlling mechanisms give
rise to primary renal vascular lesions. These diseases are as
under:
I.
Most importantly, hypertensive vascular disease and its
consequent renal manifestations in the form of benign and
malignant nephrosclerosis.
II. Thrombotic microangiopathy.
III. Renal cortical necrosis.
IV. Renal infarcts.
Renal infarcts are already described in Chapter 5; other
conditions are discussed here.
HYPERTENSIVE  VASCULAR DISEASE
An elevated arterial blood pressure is a major health problem,
particularly in developed countries. A persistent and
sustained high blood pressure has damaging effects on the
heart (e.g. hypertensive heart disease, Chapter 16), brain (e.g.
cerebrovascular accident or stroke, Chapter 30) and kidneys
(benign and malignant nephrosclerosis).
Definition and Classification
Hypertension is a common disease in industrialised  count-
ries and accounts for 6% of death worldwide. Epidemiologic
studies have revealed that with elevation in systolic and
diastolic blood pressure above normal in adults, there is a
continuous increased risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke
and renal disease—cardiovascular risk doubles with every
20 mmHg increase in systolic and 10 mmHg increase in
diastolic blood pressure above normal levels. Recently,
criteria for normal blood pressure, prehypertension and
hypertension (stage 1 and stage 2) have been laid by the
National Institutes of Health (NIH), US (Table 22.14).
According to this criteria, normal cut-off values for systolic
and diastolic blood pressure are taken as < 120 and < 80
mmHg respectively.  As per this criteria, arterial or systemic
hypertension in adults is defined clinically as persistently
elevated systolic blood pressure of 140-159 mmHg, or
diastolic pressure of 90-99 mmHg as stage 1 hypertension,
and corresponding values above 160 or above 100 mmHg
as stage 2 hypertension. Cases falling between upper normal
values for systolic and diastolic blood pressure (i.e. above
120/80 mmHg) and those for stage 1 hypertension (120-
139/80-89 mmHg) are grouped under prehypertension
requiring monitoring anf follow-up. The diastolic pressure
is often considered more significant. Since blood pressure
varies with many factors such as age of the patient, exercise,
emotional disturbances like fear and anxiety, it is important
to measure blood pressure at least twice during two
separate examinations under least stressful conditions.
Hypertension is generally classified into 2 types:
1.
Primary or essential hypertension in which the cause of
increase in blood pressure is unknown. Essential
hypertension constitutes about 80-95% patients of
hypertension.
2.
Secondary hypertension, in which the increase in blood
pressure is caused by diseases of the kidneys, endocrines or
some other organs. Secondary hypertension comprises
remaining 5-20% cases of hypertension.
According to the clinical course, both essential and
secondary hypertension may be benign or malignant.
Benign hypertension is moderate elevation of blood
pressure and the rise is slow over the years. About 90-95%
patients of hypertension have benign hypertension.
Malignant hypertension is marked and suden increase
of blood pressure to 200/140 mmHg or more in a known
case of hypertension or in a previously normotensive
individual; the patients develop papilloedema, retinal
haemorrhages and hypertensive encephalopathy. Less than
5% of hypertensive patients develop malignant hypertension
and life expectancy after diagnosis in these patients is
generally less than 2 years if not treated effectively.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Etiology and Pathogenesis
The etiology and pathogenesis of secondary hypertension
that comprises less than 10% cases has been better
understood, whereas the mechanism of essential
hypertension that constitutes about 90% of cases remains
largely obscure. In general, normal blood pressure is
regulated by 2 haemodynamic forces—cardiac output and total
peripheral vascular resistance. Factors which alter these two
factors result in hypertension. The role of kidney in
hypertension, particularly in secondary hypertension, by
elaboration of renin and subsequent formation of angiotensin
II, is well established (renin-angiotensin system).
With this background knowledge, we next turn to the
mechanisms involved in the two forms of hypertension
(Table 22.15).
ESSENTIAL (PRIMARY) HYPERTENSION. By definition,
the cause of essential hypertension is unknown but a number
of factors are related to its development. These are as under:
1.
Genetic factors. The role of heredity in the etiology of
essential hypertension has long been suspected. The
evidences in support are the familial aggregation, occurrence
of hypertension in twins, epidemiologic data, experimental
animal studies and identification of hypertension
susceptibility gene (angiotensinogen gene).
2.
Racial and environmental factors. Surveys in the US
have revealed higher incidence of essential hypertension in
African Americans than in whites. A number of environ-
mental factors have been implicated in the development of
hypertension including salt intake, obesity, skilled
occupation, higher living standards and individuals under
high stress.
3.
Risk factors modifying the course of essential hyper-
tension. There is sufficient evidence to show that the course
of essential hypertension that begins in middle life is
modified by a number of factors. These are as under:
i)
Age. Younger the age at which hypertension is first noted
but left untreated, lower the life expectancy.
ii) Sex. Females with hypertension appear to do better than
males.
iii) Atherosclerosis. Accelerated atherosclerosis invariably
accompanies essential hypertension. This could be due to
contributory role of other independent factors like cigarette
smoking, elevated serum cholesterol, glucose intolerance and
obesity.
iv) Other risk factors. Other factors which alter the prognosis
in hypertension include: smoking, excess of alcohol intake,
diabetes mellitus, persistently high diastolic pressure above
normal and evidence of end-organ damage (i.e. heart, eyes,
kidney and nervous system).
The pathogenetic mechanism in essential hypertension is
explained by many theories. These are as under:
1.
High plasma level of catecholamines.
2.
Increase in blood volume i.e. arterial overfilling (volume
hypertension) and arteriolar constriction (vasoconstrictor
hypertension).
3.
Increased cardiac output.
4.
Low-renin essential hypertension found in approximately
20% patients due to altered responsiveness to renin release.
5.
High renin essential hypertension seen in about 15% cases
due to decreased adrenal responsiveness to angiotensin II.
SECONDARY HYPERTENSION. Though much less
common than essential hypertension, mechanisms under-
lying secondary hypertension with identifiable cause have
been studied more extensively. Based on the etiology, these
are described under four headings: renal hypertension,
endocrine hypertension, hypertension associated with
coarctation of aorta and neurogenic causes.
1.
RENAL HYPERTENSION. Hypertension produced by
renal diseases is called renal hypertension. Renal
hypertension is subdivided into 2 groups:
i)
Renal vascular hypertension e.g. in occlusion of a major
renal artery, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, polyarteritis nodosa
and fibromuscular dysplasia of renal artery.
ii) Renal parenchymal hypertension e.g. in various types of
glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis, interstitial nephritis,
diabetic nephropathy, amyloidosis, polycystic kidney disease
and renin-producing tumours.
In either case, renal hypertension can be produced by
one of the following 3 inter-related pathogenetic mechanisms:
a) Activation of renin-angiotensin system. Renin is a
proteolytic enzyme produced and stored in the granules of
the juxtaglomerular cells surrounding the afferent arterioles
of glomerulus (page 651). The release of renin is stimulated
by renal ischaemia, sympathetic nervous system stimulation,
depressed sodium concentration, fluid depletion and
decreased potassium intake. Released renin is transported
through blood stream to the liver where it acts upon substrate
angiotensinogen, an α2-globulin synthesised in the liver, to
form angiotensin I, a decapeptide. Angiotensin I is converted
into angiotensin II, an octapeptide, by the action of convertase
in the lungs. Angiotensin II is the most potent naturally-
occurring vasoconstrictor substance and its pressor action is
mainly attributed to peripheral arteriolar vasoconstriction.
The other main effect of angiotensin II is to stimulate the
adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone that promotes
reabsorption of sodium and water.
Thus, the renin-angiotensin system is concerned mainly
with 3 functions:

i)
Control of blood pressure by altering plasma concen-
tration of angiotensin II and aldosterone.
ii) Regulation of sodium and water content.
iii) Regulation of potassium balance.
The renin-angiotensin mechanism is summarised in
Fig. 22.34.
b) Sodium and water retention. Blood volume and cardiac
output, both of which have a bearing on blood pressure, are
regulated by blood levels of sodium which is significant for
maintaining extracellular fluid volume. Blood concentration
of sodium is regulated by 3 mechanisms:
i)
Release of aldosterone from activation of renin-angiotensin
system, as already explained.
ii) Reduction in GFR due to reduced blood flow as occurs in
reduced renal mass or renal artery stenosis. This results in
proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium.
iii) Release of atriopeptin hormone from atria of the heart in
response to volume expansion. These peptides cause
increased GFR and inhibit sodium reabsorption.
c) Release of vasodepressor material. A number of vaso-
depressor materials and antihypertensives counterbalance
the vasopressor effect of angiotensin II. These substances
include: prostaglandins (PGE2, PGF2, PGA or medullin)
released from interstitial cells of the medulla, urinary
kallikrein-kinin system and platelet-activating factor.
2.
ENDOCRINE HYPERTENSION. A number of hormonal
secretions may produce secondary hypertension. These are:
i)
Adrenal gland—e.g. in primary aldosteronism, Cushing’s
syndrome, adrenal virilism and pheochromocytoma.
ii) Parathyroid gland—e.g. hypercalcaemia in hyperpara-
thyroidism.
iii) Oral contraceptives—Oestrogen component in the oral
contraceptives stimulates hepatic synthesis of renin substrate.
3.
COARCTATION OF AORTA. Coarctation of the aorta
causes systolic hypertension in the upper part of the body
due to constriction itself (Chapter 15). Diastolic hypertension
results from changes in circulation.
4.
NEUROGENIC. Psychogenic, polyneuritis, increased
intracranial pressure and section of spinal cord are all
uncommon causes of secondary hypertension.
EFFECTS OF HYPERTENSION
Systemic hypertension causes major effects in three main
organs—heart and its blood vessels, nervous system, and
kidneys. The renal effects in the form of benign and malignant
nephrosclerosis are discussed below, whereas hypertensive
effects on other organs are described elsewhere in the
respective chapters. An important and early clinical marker
for renal injury from hypertension and risk factor for
cardiovascular disease is macroalbuminuria (i.e. albuminuria
> 150 mg/day or random urine albumin/creatinine ratio of
>300 mg/gm creatinine), or microalbuminuria estimated by
radioimmunoassay (i.e. microalbumin 30-300 mg/day or
random urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio of
30-300 mg/gm creatinine).
Benign Nephrosclerosis
Benign nephrosclerosis is the term used to describe the
kidney of benign phase of hypertension. Mild benign
nephrosclerosis is the most common form of renal disease in
persons over 60 years of age but its severity increases in the
presence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, both the kidneys
are affected equally and are reduced in size and weight,
often weighing about 100 gm or less. The capsule is often
adherent to the cortical surface. The surface of the kidney
is finely granular and shows V-shaped areas of scarring.*
The cut surface shows firm kidney and narrowed cortex
(Fig. 22.35).
Microscopically, there are primarily diffuse vascular
changes which produce parenchymal changes secondarily
Figure 22.34
The renin-angiotensin mechanism.
*The various acquired causes of ‘small contracted kidney’ and their
characteristic gross macroscopic appearance may be recollected here.
These are: 1. Chronic GN (granular appearance); 2. Chronic pyelonephritis
(U-shaped scars); and 3. Benign nephrosclerosis (V-shaped scars).
Although granular, U- and V-shaped scars correspond to the respective
macroscopic patterns, acronym to remember is: ‘granular’ for glomerular
scars of chronic GN; ‘U-scars’ for uneven scars of chronic pyelonephritis;
and ‘V-scars’ for vascular scars of benign nephrosclerosis. Less common
causes are: amyloidosis of the kidney, myeloma kidney and diabetic
nephropathy.

688
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
as a result of ischaemia. The histologic changes are, thus,
described as vascular and parenchymal (Fig. 22.36,A):
i)
Vascular changes: Changes in blood vessels involve
arterioles and arteries up to the size of arcuate arteries.
There are 2 types of changes in these blood vessels:
a) Hyaline arteriolosclerosis that results in homogeneous
and eosinophilic thickening of the wall of small blood
vessels.
b) lntimal thickening due to proliferation of smooth muscle
cells in the intima.
ii) Parenchymal changes: As a consequence of ischaemia,
there is variable degree of atrophy of parenchyma. This
includes: glomerular shrinkage, deposition of collagen in
Bowman’s space, periglomerular fibrosis, tubular atrophy
and fine interstitial fibrosis.
CLINICAL FEATURES. There is variable elevation of the
blood pressure with headache, dizziness, palpitation and
nervousness. Eye ground changes may be found but
papilloedema is absent. Renal function tests and urine
examination are normal in early stage. In long-standing cases,
there may be mild proteinuria with some hyaline or granular
casts. Rarely, renal failure and uraemia may occur.
Malignant Nephrosclerosis
Malignant nephrosclerosis is the form of renal disease that
occurs in malignant or accelerated hypertension. Malignant
nephrosclerosis is uncommon and usually occurs as a
superimposed complication in 5% cases of pre-existing
benign essential hypertension or in those having secondary
hypertension with identifiable cause such as in chronic renal
diseases. However, the pure form of disease also occurs,
particularly at younger age with preponderance in males.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the appearance
of the kidney varies. In a case of malignant hypertension
superimposed on pre-existing benign nephrosclerosis, the
kidneys are small in size, shrunken and reduced in weight
and have finely granular surface. However, the kidneys
of a patient who develops malignant hypertension in pure
form are enlarged, oedematous and have petechial
haemorrhages on the surface producing so called ‘flea-
bitten kidney’.* Cut surface shows red and yellow mottled
appearance (Fig. 22.37).
Microscopically, most commonly the changes are
superimposed on benign nephrosclerosis. These changes
are as under (Fig. 22.36,B):
i)
Vascular changes: These are more severe and involve
the arterioles. The two characteristic vascular changes seen
are as under:
a) Necrotising arteriolitis develops on hyaline arterio-
losclerosis. The vessel wall shows fibrinoid necrosis, a few
acute inflammatory cells and small haemorrhages.
b) Hyperplastic intimal sclerosis or onionskin proliferation is
characterised by concentric laminae of proliferated smooth
muscle cells, collagen and basement membranes.
ii) Ischaemic changes: The effects of vascular narrowing
on the parenchyma include tubular loss, fine interstitial
fibrosis and foci of infarction necrosis.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The patients of malignant
nephrosclerosis have malignant or accelerated hypertension
with blood pressure of 200/140 mmHg or higher. Headache,
dizziness and impaired vision are commonly found. The
presence of papilloedema distinguishes malignant from
benign phase of hypertension. The urine frequently shows
haematuria and proteinuria. Renal function tests show
deterioration during the course of the illness. Azotaemia
(high BUN and serum creatinine) and uraemia develop soon
if malignant hypertension is not treated aggressively.
Approximately 90% of patients die within one year from
causes such as uraemia, congestive heart failure and
cerebrovascular accidents.
*Recall the other causes of flea-bitten kidney: acute post-streptococcal GN,
rapidly progressive GN, haemolytic-uraemic syndrome, thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura and Henoch-Schonlein purpura.

CHAPTER 22
The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tract
THROMBOTIC MICROANGIOPATHY
Thrombotic renal disease encompasses a group of diseases
having in common the formation of thrombi composed by
platelets and fibrin in arterioles and glomeruli of the kidney
and culminating clinically in acute renal failure. Causes of
thrombotic microangiopathy of renal microvasculature are
listed in Table 22.16.
Figure 22.36
Microscopic changes in kidney in hypertension. A,
Benign nephrosclerosis. The vascular changes are hyaline
arteriolosclerosis and intimal thickening of small blood vessels in the
glomerular tuft. The parenchymal changes include sclerosed glomeruli,
tubular atrophy and fine interstitial fibrosis. B, Malignant nephrosclerosis.
The vascular changes are necrotising arteriolitis and hyperplastic intimal
sclerosis or onion-skin proliferation. The parenchymal changes are tubular
loss, fine interstitial fibrosis and foci of infarction necrosis.
The common clinical manifestations include microangio-
pathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, DIC, and
eventually renal failure.
PATHOGENESIS In all such cases, endothelial injury
appears to be the trigger for vascular changes. The injured
endothelial surface causes the following effects:
Passage of plasma constituents to the subendothelial zone
of microvasculature.
Promotes thrombosis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The lesions closely
resemble those of malignant nephrosclerosis. The features
are as under:
Fibrinoid necrosis of arterioles.
Thrombi in renal microvasculature.
Oedema of intima of arterioles.
Consolidation, necrosis and congestion of glomeruli.
If the renal lesions are massive, the prognosis is generally
lethal.

size and weight. The cortex shows characteristic ‘flea bitten kidney’ due
to tiny petechial haemorrhages on the surface.
RENAL CORTICAL NECROSIS
Renal cortical necrosis is infarction of renal cortex varying
from microscopic foci to a situation where most of the renal
cortex is destroyed. The medulla, the juxtamedullary cortex
and a rim of cortex under the capsule are usually spared.
The condition develops most commonly as an obstetrical
emergency (e.g. in eclampsia, pre-eclampsia, premature
separation of the placenta). Other causes include septic shock,
poisoning, severe trauma etc.
The lesions may be present focally, patchily or diffusely.
The gross and microscopic characteristics of infarcts of cortex
are present. Patients present with sudden oliguria or anuria
and haematuria. If the process has involved renal cortex
extensively, acute renal failure and uraemia develop and
prognosis is grave.
OBSTRUCTIVE UROPATHY
Obstruction in the urinary tract is common and important
because it increases the susceptibility to infection and stone
formation. Obstruction can occur at any age and in either
sex. The cause of obstruction may lie at any level of the
urinary tract—renal pelvis, ureters, urinary bladder and
urethra. The obstruction at any of these anatomic locations
may be intraluminal, intramural or extramural. Important
causes are listed in Table 22.17 and illustrated in Fig. 22.38.
The obstruction may be unilateral or bilateral, partial or
complete, sudden or insidious. Complete bilateral
obstruction may result in irreversible renal failure, whereas
long-standing chronic partial obstruction may cause various
functional abnormalities and anatomic changes. There are
three important anatomic sequelae of obstruction, namely:
hydronephrosis, hydroureter and hypertrophy of the bladder.

common and important cause of obstructive uropathy,

NEPHROLITHIASIS
Nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis is formation of urinary calculi
at any level of the urinary tract. Urinary calculi are worldwide
in distribution but are particularly common in some
geographic locations such as in parts of the United States,
South Africa, India and South-East Asia. It is estimated that
approximately 2% of the population experiences renal stone
disease at sometime in their life with male-female ratio of
2:1. The peak incidence is observed in 2nd to 3rd decades of
life. Renal calculi are characterised clinically by colicky pain

(renal colic) as they pass down along the ureter and manifest
by haematuria.
Types of Urinary Calculi
There are 4 main types of urinary calculi—calcium
containing, mixed (struvite), uric acid and cystine stones, and
a few rare types (Table 22.18).
1.
CALCIUM STONES. Calcium stones are the most
common comprising about 75% of all urinary calculi. They
may be pure stones of calcium oxalate (50%) or calcium
phosphate (5%), or mixture of calcium oxalate and calcium
phosphate (45%).
Etiology. Etiology of calcium stones is variable.
i)
About 50% of patients with calcium stones have idiopathic
hypercalciuria without hypercalcaemia.
ii) Approximately 10% cases are associated with hyper-
calcaemia and hypercalciuria, most commonly due to hyper-
parathyroidism, or a defect in the bowel (i.e. absorptive
hypercalciuria), or in the kidney (i.e. renal hypercalciuria).
iii) About 15% of patients with calcium stones have
hyperuricosuria with a normal blood uric acid level and without
any abnormality of calcium metabolism.
iv) In about 25% of patients with calcium stones, the cause
is unknown as there is no abnormality in urinary excretion
of calcium, uric acid or oxalate and is referred to as ‘idiopathic
calcium stone disease’.
Pathogenesis. The mechanism of calcium stone formation is
explained on the basis of imbalance between the degree of
supersaturation of the ions forming the stone and the
concentration of inhibitors in the urine. Most likely site where
the crystals of calcium oxalate and/or calcium phosphate
are precipitated is the tubular lining or around some
fragment of debris in the tubule acting as nidus of the stone.
The stone grows, as more and more crystals are deposited
around the nidus. A number of other predisposing factors
contributing to formation of calcium stones are alkaline
urinary pH, decreased urinary volume and increased
excretion of oxalate and uric acid.
Morphology. Calcium stones are usually small (less than a
centimeter), ovoid, hard, with granular rough surface. They
are dark brown due to old blood pigment deposited in them
as a result of repeated trauma caused to the urinary tract by
these sharp-edged stones.
2.
MIXED (STRUVITE) STONES. About 15% of urinary
calculi are made of magnesium-ammonium-calcium
phosphate, often called struvite; hence mixed stones are also
called as ‘struvite stones’ or ‘triple phosphate stones’.
Etiology. Struvite stones are formed as a result of infection
of the urinary tract with urea-splitting organisms that
produce urease such as by species of Proteus, and occasionally
Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Enterobacter. These are, therefore,
also known as infection-induced stones. However, E. coli does
not form urease.
Morphology. Struvite stones are yellow-white or grey. They
tend to be soft and friable and irregular in shape. ‘Staghorn
stone’ which is a large, solitary stone that takes the shape of
the renal pelvis where it is often formed is an example of
struvite stone (Fig. 22.39).

the kidney contains a single, large, sof t yellow white stone t aking the
contour of the pelvi-calyceal system (arrow).

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
3.
URIC ACID STONES. Approximately 6% of urinary
calculi are made of uric acid. Uric acid calculi are radiolucent
unlike radio-opaque calcium stones.
Etiology. Uric acid stones are frequently formed in cases with
hyperuricaemia and hyperuricosuria such as due to primary
gout or secondary gout due to myeloproliferative disorders
(e.g. in leukaemias), especially those on chemotherapy, and
administration of uricosuric drugs (e.g. salicylates,
probenacid). Other factors contributing to their formation are
acidic urinary pH (below 6) and low urinary volume.
Pathogenesis. The solubility of uric acid at pH of 7 is 200
mg/dl while at pH of 5 is 15 mg/dl. Thus, as the urine
becomes more acidic, the solubility of uric acid in urine
decreases and precipitation of uric acid crystals increases
favouring the formation of uric acid stones. Hyperuricosuria
is the most important factor in the production of uric acid
stones, while hyperuricaemia is found in about half the cases.
Morphology. Uric acid stones are smooth, yellowish-brown,
hard and often multiple. On cut section, they show laminated
structure.
4.
CYSTINE STONES. Cystine stones comprise less than
2% of urinary calculi.
Etiology. Cystine stones are associated with cystinuria due
to a genetically-determined defect in the transport of cystine
and other amino acids across the cell membrane of the renal
tubules and the small intestinal mucosa.
Pathogenesis. The resultant excessive excretion of cystine
which is least soluble of the naturally-occurring amino acids
leads to formation of crystals and eventually cystine calculi.
Morphology. Cystine stones are small, rounded, smooth and
often multiple. They are yellowish and waxy.
5.
OTHER CALCULI. Less than 2% of urinary calculi
consist of other rare types such as due to inherited abnor-
mality of enzyme metabolism e.g. hereditary xanthinuria
developing xanthine stones.
HYDRONEPHROSIS
Hydronephrosis is the term used for dilatation of renal pelvis
and calyces due to partial or intermittent obstruction to the

outflow of urine (see Fig. 22.38). Hydronephrosis develops if
one or both the pelviureteric sphincters are incompetent, as
otherwise there will be dilatation and hypertrophy of the
urinary bladder but no hydronephrosis. Hydroureter nearly
always accompanies hydronephrosis. Hydronephrosis may
be unilateral or bilateral.
Unilateral Hydronephrosis
This occurs due to some form of ureteral obstruction at the
level of pelviureteric junction (PUJ). The causes are:
1.
Intraluminal e.g. a calculus in the ureter or renal pelvis.
2.
Intramural e.g. congenital PUJ obstruction, atresia of
ureter, inflammatory stricture, trauma, neoplasm of ureter
or bladder.
3.
Extramural e.g. obstruction of upper part of the ureter
by inferior renal artery or vein, pressure on ureter from
outside such as carcinoma cervix, prostate, rectum, colon or
caecum and retroperitoneal fibrosis.
Bilateral Hydronephrosis
This is generally the result of some form of urethral obstruc-
tion but can occur from the various causes listed above if the
lesions involve both sides. Based on this, hydronephrosis may
be of following types:
1.
Congenital e.g. atresia of the urethral meatus, congenital
posterior urethral valve.
2.
Acquired e.g. bladder tumour involving both ureteric
orifices, prostatic enlargement, prostatic carcinoma and
prostatitis, bladder neck stenosis, inflammatory or traumatic
urethral stricture and phimosis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The pathologic changes
vary depending upon whether the obstruction is sudden
and complete, or incomplete and intermittent. The latter
situation is more common.
Grossly, the kidneys may have moderate to marked
enlargement. Initially, there is extrarenal hydronephrosis
characterised by dilatation of renal pelvis medially in the
form of a sac (Fig. 22.40,A). As the obstruction persists,

TUMOURS OF KIDNEY
Both benign and malignant tumours occur in the kidney, the
latter being more common. These may arise from renal tubules
(adenoma, adenocarcinoma), embryonic tissue (mesoblastic
nephroma, Wilms’ tumour), mesenchymal tissue
(angiomyolipoma, medullary interstitial tumour) and from
the epithelium of the renal pelvis (urothelial carcinoma). Besides
these tumours, the kidney may be the site of the secondary
tumours.
Table 22.19 provides a list of kidney tumours; the impor-
tant forms of renal neoplasms are described below.
BENIGN  TUMOURS
Benign renal tumours are usually small and are often an
incidental finding at autopsy or nephrectomy.
Cortical Adenoma
Cortical tubular adenomas are more common than other
benign renal neoplasms. They are frequently multiple and
associated with chronic pyelonephritis or benign
nephrosclerosis.
Grossly, these tumours may form tiny nodules up to 3
cm in diameter. They are encapsulated and white or
yellow.
Microscopically, they are composed of tubular cords or
papillary structures projecting into cystic space. The cells
of the adenoma are usually uniform, cuboidal with no
atypicality or mitosis. However, size of the tumour rather
than histologic criteria is considered more significant
parameter to predict the behaviour of the tumour—those
larger than 3 cm in diameter are potentially malignant
and metastasising.
there is progressive dilatation of pelvis and calyces and
pressure atrophy of renal parenchyma. Eventually, the
dilated pelvi-calyceal system extends deep into the renal
cortex so that a thin rim of renal cortex is stretched over
the dilated calyces and the external surface assumes
lobulated appearance. This advanced stage is called as
intrarenal hydronephrosis (Fig. 22.40,B). An important point
of distinction between the sectioned surface of advanced
hydronephrosis and polycystic kidney disease (page 657)
is the direct continuity of dilated cystic spaces (i.e. dila-
ted calyces) with the renal pelvis in the former (Fig. 22.41).
Microscopically, the wall of hydronephrotic sac is
thickened due to fibrous scarring and chronic inflam-
matory cell infiltrate. There is progressive atrophy of
tubules and glomeruli alongwith interstitial fibrosis. Stasis
of urine in hydronephrosis causes infection (pyelitis)
resulting in filling of the sac with pus, a condition called
pyonephrosis.

Hydronephrosis, stages in its evolution.

enlarged and heavy. On cut section, the renal pelvis and calyces are
dilated and cystic and contain a large stone in the pelvis of the kidney
(arrow). The cystic change is seen to extend into renal p
arenchyma,
compressing the cortex as a thin rim at the periphery . Unlike polycystic
kidney, however, these cysts are communicating with the pelvi-calyceal
system.

694
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Oncocytoma
Oncocytoma is a benign epithelial tumour arising from
collecting ducts.
Grossly, The tumour is encapsulated and has variable size.
Cut section is homogeneous and has characteristic
mahogany-brown or tan colour.
Microscopically, the tumour cells are plump with
abundant, finely granular, acidophilic cytoplasm and
round nuclei. Electron microscopy demonstrates
numerous mitochondria in the cytoplasm.
Other Benign Tumours
Angiomyolipoma is a hamartoma of the kidney that
contains differentiated tissue element derived from blood
vessels, smooth muscle and fat. Patients of tuberous sclerosis,
a multisystem disease characterised by skin lesions, CNS and
renal involvement, frequently have bilateral angiomyo-
lipomas.
Mesoblastic nephroma is a congenital benign tumour.
Grossly, the tumour resembles a uterine leiomyoma in
having whorled appearance.
Microscopically, it shows cellular growth of spindle cells
derived from secondary mesenchyme.
Multicystic nephroma is another uncommon tumour of
early infancy.
Grossly, it is a solitary, unilateral well demarcated tumour
of varying size. Cut surface shows characteristic
multilocular appearance.
Microscopically, the cysts are lined by tubular epithelium
while the stroma between the cysts contains mesenchymal
tissue with some immature blastemal or abortive tubules.
Some authors consider this entity as fully-differentiated
variant of Wilms’ tumour. However, clinically multicystic
nephroma is always benign compared to Wilms’ tumour.
Medullary interstitial cell tumour is a tiny nodule in the
medulla composed of fibroblast-like cells in hyalinised
stroma. These tumours used to be called renal fibromas but
electron microscopy has revealed that the tumour cells are
not fibrocytes but are medullary interstitial cells.
Juxtaglomerular tumour or reninoma is a rare tumour
of renal cortex consisting of sheets of epithelioid cells with
many small blood vessels. The tumour secretes excessive
quantities of renin and, thus, the patients are likely to have
hypertension.
MALIGNANT TUMOURS
The two most common primary malignant tumours of the
kidney are adenocarcinoma and Wilms’ tumour. A third
malignant renal tumour is urothelial carcinoma occurring more
commonly in the renal pelvis is described in the next section
along with other tumours of the lower urinary tract.
Adenocarcinoma of Kidney (Synonyms: Renal cell
carcinoma, Hypernephroma, Grawitz tumour)
Hypernephroma is an old misnomer under the mistaken
belief that the tumour arises from adrenal rests because of
the resemblance of the tumour cells with clear cells of the
adrenal cortex. It is now known that the renal cell carcinoma
(RCC) is an adenocarcinoma arising from tubular epithelium.
This cancer comprises 70 to 80% of all renal cancers and
occurs most commonly in 50 to 70 years of age with male
preponderance (2:1).
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS. Various etiologic
factors implicated in the etiology of RCC are as follows:
1.
Tobacco. Tobacco is the major risk factor for RCC,
whether chewed or smoked and accounts for 20-30% cases
of RCC. Cigarette smokers have two-fold higher risk of
developing RCC.
2.
Genetic factors. Heredity and first-degree relatives of
RCC are associated with higher risk. Although majority of
cases of RCC are sporadic but about 5% cases are inherited.
These cases have following associations:
i)
von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease: It is an autosomal
dominant cancer syndrome that includes: haemangio-
blastoma of the cerebellum, retinal angiomas, multiple RCC
(clear cell type), pheochromocytoma and cysts in different
organs. Patients of VHL disease have germline mutations of
tumour suppressor VHL gene located on chromosome 3p,
commonly as homozygous loss of VHL gene. About 35%
cases of VHL develop RCC.

ii) Hereditary clear cell RCC: These are cases of clear cell type
RCC confined to the kidney without other manifestations of
VHL but having autosomal dominant inheritance.
iii) Papillary RCC: This form of RCC is characterised by
bilateral and multifocal cancer with papillary growth pattern.
Genetic abnormality in these cases lies in MET gene located
on chromosome 7.
iv) Chromophobe RCC: These cases have genetic defects in the
form of multiple losses of whole chromosomes i.e. they have
extreme degree of hypodiploidy.
3.
Cystic diseases of the kidneys. Both hereditary and
acquired cystic diseases of the kidney have increased risk of
development of RCC. Patients on longterm dialysis develop
acquired cystic disease which may evolve into RCC and
adenomas. Adult polycystic kidney disease and multicystic
nephroma is associated with higher occurrence of papillary
RCC.
4. Other risk factors. Besides above, following other factors
are associated with higher incidence of RCC:
i)
Exposure to asbestos, heavy metals and petrochemical
products.
ii) In women, obesity and oestrogen therapy.
iii) Analgesic nephropathy.
v) Tuberous sclerosis.
CLASSIFICATION. Based on cytogenetics of sporadic and
familial tumours, RCC has been reclassified into clear cell,
papillary, granular cell, chromophobe, sarcomatoid and
collecting duct type (Table 22.20).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, RCC commonly
arises from the poles of the kidney as a solitary and
unilateral tumour, more often in the upper pole. The
tumour is generally large, golden yellow and circum-
scribed. Papillary tumours have grossly visible papillae
and may be multifocal. About 1% RCC are bilateral. Cut
section of the tumour commonly shows large areas of
ischaemic necrosis, cystic change and foci of haemor-
rhages. Another significant characteristic is the frequent
presence of tumour thrombus in the renal vein which may
extend into the vena cava (Fig. 22.42).
Histologically, the features of various types of RCC are
as under:
1.
Clear cell type RCC (70%): This is the most common
pattern. The clear cytoplasm of tumour cells is due to
removal of glycogen and lipid from the cytoplasm during
processing of tissues. The tumour cells have a variety of
patterns: solid, trabecular and tubular, separated by
delicate vasculature. Majority of clear cell tumours are well
differentiated (Fig. 22.43).
2.
Papillary type RCC (15%): The tumour cells are arran-
ged in papillary pattern over the fibrovascular stalks. The
tumour cells are cuboidal with small round nuclei.
Psammoma bodies may be seen.
3.
Granular cell type RCC (8%): The tumour cells have
abundant acidophilic cytoplasm. These tumours have
more marked nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromatism
and cellular atypia.
4.
Chromophobe type RCC (5%): This type shows
admixture of pale clear cells with perinuclear halo and
acidophilic granular cells. The cytoplasm of these tumour
cells contains many vesicles.
5.
Sarcomatoid type RCC (1.5%): This is the most anaplastic
and poorly differentiated form. The tumour is
characterised by whorls of atypical spindle tumour cells.
6.
Collecting duct type RCC (0.5%): This is a rare type that
occurs in the medulla. It is composed of  a single  layer of
cuboidal tumour cells arranged in tubular and papillary
pattern.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Renal cell carcinoma is generally a
slow-growing tumour and the tumour may have been
present for years before it is detected. The classical clinical

Systemic Pathology
evidence for diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma is the triad of
gross haematuria, flank plain and palpable abdominal mass. The
most common presenting abnormality is haematuria that
occurs in about 60% of cases. By the time the tumour is
detected, it has spread to distant sites via haematogenous
route to the lungs, brain and bone, and locally to the liver
and perirenal lymph nodes.
Systemic symptoms of fatiguability, weight loss, cachexia
and intermittent fever unassociated with evidence of infection
are found in many cases at presentation. A number of
paraneoplastic syndromes due to ectopic hormone
production by the renal cell carcinoma have been described.
These include polycythaemia (by erythropoietin), hyper-
calcaemia (by parathyroid hormone and prostaglandins),
hypertension (by renin), effects of feminisation or masculinisation
(by gonadotropins) and Cushing’s syndrome (by gluco-
corticoids).
The prognosis in renal cell carcinoma depends upon the
extent of tumour involvement at the time of diagnosis. The
overall 5-year survival rate is about 70%. Presence of
metastases, renal vein invasion and higher nuclear grade of
the tumour are some of the predictors of poor prognosis.
Wilms’  Tumour
(Synonym: Nephroblastoma)
Nephroblastoma or Wilms’ tumour is an embryonic tumour
derived from primitive renal epithelial and mesenchymal
components. It is the most common abdominal malignant

tumour of young children, seen most commonly between 1
to 6 years of age with equal sex incidence.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS. Wilms’ tumour has
following etiologic associations:
1. A defect in chromosome 11p13 results in abnormal growth
of metanephric blastema without differentiation into normal
tubules and glomeruli.
2. A higher incidence has been seen in monozygotic twins
and cases with family history.
3. Association of Wilms’ tumour with some other congenital
anomalies has been observed, especially of the genitourinary
tract.
4. A few other malignancies are known to have higher
incidence of Wilms’ tumour. These include osteosarcoma,
botyroid sarcoma, retinoblastoma, neuroblastoma etc.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
usually quite large, spheroidal, replacing most of the
kidney. It is generally solitary and unilateral but
5-10% cases may have bilateral tumour. On cut section,
the tumour shows characteristic variegated appearance—
soft, fishflesh-like grey-white to cream-yellow tumour
with foci of necrosis and haemorrhages and grossly
identifiable myxomatous or cartilaginous elements
(Fig. 22.44). Invasion into renal vein is grossly evident in
half the cases.
Microscopically, nephroblastoma shows mixture of
primitive epithelial and mesenchymal elements. Most of
the tumour consists of small, round to spindled,
anaplastic, sarcomatoid tumour cells. In these areas are
present abortive tubules and poorly-formed glomerular
structures (Fig. 22.45). Mesenchymal elements such as
smooth and skeletal muscle, cartilage and bone, fat cells
and fibrous tissue, may be seen.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The most common presenting
feature is a palpable abdominal mass in a child. Other

Systemic Pathology
common abnormalities are haematuria, pain, fever and
hypertension. The tumour rapidly spreads via blood,
especially to lungs.
The prognosis of the tumour with combination therapy
of nephrectomy, post-operative irradiation and chemo-
therapy, has improved considerably and the 5-year survival
now is 80-90%.
Secondary  Tumours
Leukaemic infiltration of the kidneys is a common finding,
particularly in chronic myeloid leukaemia. Kidney is a
common site for blood-borne metastases from different
primary sites, chiefly from cancers of the lungs, breast and
stomach.
LOWER  URINARY  TRACT
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The lower urinary tract consists of ureters, urinary bladder and
urethra.
URETERS are tubular structures, 30 cm in length and half a
centimeter in diameter, and extend from the renal pelvis
(pelvi-ureteric junction) to the urinary bladder (vesico-
ureteric junction). Normally they enter obliquely into the
bladder, so that ureter is compressed during micturition, thus
preventing vesico-ureteric reflux. Ureters lie retroperitoneally
throughout their course.
Histologically, ureter has an outer fibrous investing layer
which overlies a thick muscular layer and is lined internally
by transitional epithelium or urothelium similar to the lining
of the renal pelvis above and bladder below.
URINARY BLADDER lies extraperitoneally and the
peritoneum is reflected on its superior surface. Besides
superior surface (or dome), the bladder has posterior surface
(or base) and two lateral surfaces. The trigone is at the base of
the bladder and continues as blader neck. Normally, the
capacity of bladder is about 400 to 500 ml without over-
distension. Micturition is partly a reflex and partly a
voluntary act under the control of sympathetic and
parasympathetic innervation.
Histologically, the greater part of the bladder wall is made
up of muscular layer (detrusor muscle) having 3 coats—
internal, middle and external. The trigone muscle is derived
from the prolongation of the longitudinal muscle layer of
each ureter. The inner layer of bladder consists of urothelium
6-7 layers in thickness. The superficial epithelial layer is made
of larger cells in the form of a row and have abundant
eosinphilic cytoplasm; these cells are called umbrella cells.
URETHRA runs from the bladder up to the external meatus.
The male urethra consists of 3 parts—prostatic, membranous
and penile. It is lined in the prostatic part by urothelium but
elsewhere by stratified columnar epithelium except near its
orifice where the epithelium is stratified squamous. The
urethral mucosa rests on highly vascular submucosa and
outer layer of striated muscle. There are numerous small
mucous glands in the urethral mucosa. The female urethra is
shorter and runs from the bladder parallel with the anterior
wall of the vagina. The mucous membrane in female urethra
is lined throughout by columnar epithelium except near the
bladder where the epithelium is transitional. The other layers
and mucous glands are similar to those in male urethra.
CONGENITAL ANOMALIES
Vesicoureteric reflux is the most common anomaly described
already on page 682. A few others are considered below.
DOUBLE URETER. This is a condition in which the entire
ureter or only the upper part is duplicated. Double ureter is
invariably associated with a double renal pelvis, one in the
upper part and the other in the lower part of the kidney. If
double ureter affects the entire length, then there are two
separate openings into the bladder on one side but more
commonly they are joined in the intravesical portion and
open by a single ureteric orifice.
URETEROCELE. Ureterocele is cystic dilatation of the
terminal part of the ureter which lies within the bladder wall.
The cystic dilatation lies beneath the bladder mucosa and
can be visualised by cystoscopy.
ECTOPIA VESICAE (EXSTROPHY). This is a rare condition
owing to congenital developmental deficiency of anterior
wall of the bladder and is associated with splitting of the
overlying anterior abdominal wall. This results in exposed
interior of the bladder. There may be prolapse of the posterior
wall of the bladder through the defect in the anterior bladder
and abdominal wall. The condition in males is often
associated with epispadias in which the urethra opens on the
dorsal aspect of penis. If the defect is not properly repaired,
the exposed bladder mucosa gets infected repeatedly and
may undergo squamous metaplasia with subsequent
increased tendency to develop carcinoma of the bladder.
URACHAL ABNORMALITIES. Rarely, there may be
persistence of the urachus in which urine passes from the
bladder to the umbilicus. More often, part of urachus remains
patent which may be the umbilical end, bladder end, or
central portion. Persistence of central portion gives rise to
urachal cyst lined by transitional or squamous epithelium.
Adenocarcinoma may develop in urachal cyst.
INFLAMMATIONS
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common, especially in females
and has been described already along with its morphologic
consequences (page 681). Inflammation of the tissues of lower
urinary tract (ureteritis, cystitis and urethritis) are considered
here.
Ureteritis
Infection of the ureter is almost always secondary to pyelitis
above, or cystitis below. Ureteritis is usually mild but
repeated and longstanding infection may give rise to chronic
ureteritis.

CHAPTER 22
The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tract
Cystitis
Inflammation of the urinary bladder is called cystitis. Primary
cystitis is rare since the normal bladder epithelium is quite
resistant to infection. Cystitis may occur by spread of
infection from upper urinary tract as seen following renal
tuberculosis, or may spread from the urethra such as in
instrumentation. Cystitis is caused by a variety of bacterial
and fungal infections as discussed in the etiology of
pyelonephritis (page 682). The most common pathogenic
organism in UTI is E. coli, followed in decreasing frequency
by Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Proteus. Infection
with Candida albicans may occur in the bladder in immuno-
suppressed patients. Besides bacterial and fungal organisms,
parasitic infestations such as with Schistosoma haematobium
is common in the Middle-East countries, particularly in
Egypt. Chlamydia and Mycoplasma may occasionally cause
cystitis. In addition, radiation, direct exposure to chemical
irritant, foreign bodies and local trauma may all initiate
cystitis.
Cystitis, like UTI, is more common in females than in
males because of the shortness of urethra which is liable to
faecal contamination and due to mechanical trauma during
sexual intercourse. In males, prostatic obstruction is a
frequent cause of cystitis. All forms of cystitis are clinically
characterised by a triad of symptoms—frequency (repeated
urination), dysuria (painful or burning micturition) and low
abdominal pain. There may, however, be systemic manifes-
tations of bacteraemia such as fever, chills and malaise.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Cystitis may be acute or
chronic.
ACUTE CYSTITIS. Grossly, the bladder mucosa is red,
swollen and haemorrhagic. There may be suppurative
exudate or ulcers on the bladder mucosa.
Microscopically, this form of cystitis is characterised by
intense neutrophilic exudate admixed with lymphocytes
and macrophages. There is oedema and congestion of
mucosa.
CHRONIC CYSTITIS. Repeated attacks of acute cystitis
lead to chronic cystitis.
Grossly, the mucosal epithelium is thickened, red and
granular with formation of polypoid masses. Long-
standing cases result in thickened bladder wall and
shrunken cavity.
Microscopically, there is patchy ulceration of the mucosa
with formation of granulation tissue in the regions of
polypoid masses. Submucosa and muscular coat show
fibrosis and infiltration by chronic inflammatory cells. A
form of chronic cystitis characterised by formation of lym-
phoid follicles in the bladder mucosa is termed cystitis
follicularis.
A few other special forms of cystitis having distinct
clinical and morphological appearance are described below.
INTERSTITIAL CYSTITIS (HUNNER’S ULCER). This
variant of cystitis occurs in middle-aged women. The patients
get repeated attacks of severe and excruciating pain on
distension of the bladder, frequency of micturition and great
decrease in bladder capacity. Cystoscopy often reveals a
localised ulcer. The etiology of the condition is unknown but
it is thought to be neurogenic in origin.
Microscopically, the submucosa and muscle coat show
increased fibrosis and chronic inflammatory infiltrate,
chiefly lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils.
CYSTITIS CYSTICA. As a result of long-standing chronic
inflammation, there occurs a downward projection of
epithelial nests known as Brunn’s nests from the deeper layer
of bladder mucosa. These epithelial cells may appear as small
cystic inclusions in the bladder wall, or may actually develop
columnar metaplasia with secretions in the lumen of cysts.
MALAKOPLAKIA. This is a rare condition most frequently
found in the urinary bladder but can occur in the ureters,
kidney, testis and prostate, and occasionally in the gut. The
etiology of the condition is unknown but probably results from
persistence of chronic inflammation with defective
phagocytic process by the macrophages. Malakoplakia
occurs more frequently in immunosuppressed patients and
recipients of transplants.
Grossly, the lesions appear as soft, flat, yellowish, slightly
raised plaques on the bladder mucosa. They may vary
from 0.5 to 5 cm in diameter.
Microscopically, the plaques are composed of massive
accumulation of foamy macrophages with occasional
multinucleate giant cells and some lymphocytes. These
macrophages have granular PAS-positive cytoplasm and
some of them contain cytoplasmic laminated concretions
of calcium phosphate called Michaelis-Gutmann bodies.
These bodies ultrastructurally represent lysosomes filled
with partly digested debris of bacteria phagocytosed by
macrophages which have not been digested fully by them
due to defective phagocytosis.
POLYPOID CYSTITIS. Polypoid cystitis is characterised by
papillary projections on the bladder mucosa due to
submucosal oedema and can be confused with transitional
cell carcinoma. The condition occurs due to indwelling
catheters and infection.
Urethritis
Urethritis may be gonococcal or non-gonococcal.
Gonococcal (gonorrhoeal) urethritis is an acute
suppurative condition caused by gonococci (Neisseria gonorr-
hoeae). The mucosa and submucosa are eventually converted
into granulation tissue which becomes fibrosed and scarred
resulting in urethral stricture.
Non-gonococcal urethritis is more common and is most
frequently caused by E. coli. The infection of urethra often
accompanies cystitis in females and prostatitis in males.
Urethritis is one of the components in the triad of Reiter’s
syndrome which comprises arthritis, conjunctivitis and

700
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
urethritis (Chapter 4). The pathologic changes are similar to
inflammation of the lower urinary tract elsewhere but
strictures are less common than following gonococcal
infection of the urethra.
TUMOURS
Majority of lower urinary tract tumours are epithelial. Both
benign and malignant tumours occur; the latter being more
common. About 90% of malignant tumours of the lower
urinary tract occur in the urinary bladder, 8% in the renal
pelvis and remaining 2% are seen in the urethra or ureters.
TUMOURS OF THE BLADDER
Epithelial (Urothelial) Bladder Tumours
More than 90% of bladder tumours arise from transitional
epithelial (urothelium) lining of the bladder in continuity
with the epithelial lining of the renal pelvis, ureters, and the
major part of the urethra. Though many workers consider
all transitional cell tumours as transitional cell carcinoma,
others distinguish true transitional cell papilloma from grade
I transitional cell carcinoma.
Bladder cancer comprises about 3% of all cancers. Most
of the cases appear beyond 5th decade of life with 3-times
higher preponderance in males than females.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Urothelial tumours in the urinary
tract are typically multifocal and the pattern of disease
becomes apparent over a period of years. A number of
environmental and host factors are associated with increased
risk of bladder cancer. These are as under:
1.
Industrial occupations. Workers in industries that
produce aniline dyes, rubber, plastic, textiles, and cable have
high incidence of bladder cancer. Bladder cancer may occur
in workers in these factories after a prolonged exposure of
about 20 years. The carcinogenic substances responsible for
bladder cancer in these cases are the metabolites of β-
naphthylamine and benzene.
2.
Schistosomiasis. There is increased risk of bladder cancer,
particularly squamous cell carcinoma, in patients having
bilharzial infestation (Schistosoma haematobium) of the
bladder. Schistosomiasis is common in Egypt and accounts
for high incidence of bladder cancer in that country. It is
thought to induce local irritant effect and initiate squamous
metaplasia followed by squamous cell carcinoma.
3.
Dietary factors. Certain carcinogenic metabolites of
tryptophan are excreted in urine of patients with bladder
cancer. These metabolites have been shown to induce bladder
cancer in experimental animals. The role of artificial
sweeteners like saccharin, coffee or caffeine and chronic
alcoholism in the etiology of bladder cancer in man is
controversial.
4.
Local lesions. A number of local lesions in the bladder
predispose to the development of bladder cancer. These
include ectopia vesicae (extrophied bladder), vesical
diverticulum, leukoplakia of the bladder mucosa and urinary
diversion in defunctionalised bladder. All these conditions
are associated with squamous metaplasia and high incidence
of bladder cancer.
5.
Smoking. Tobacco smoking is associated with 2 to 3 fold
increased risk of developing bladder cancer, probably due
to increased urinary excretion of carcinogenic substances.
6.
Drugs. Immunosuppressive therapy with cyclo-
phosphamide and patients having analgesic-abuse
(phenacetin-) nephropathy have high risk of developing
bladder cancer.
Multicentric nature of urothelial cancer and high rate of
recurrence has led to the hypothesis that a field effect in the
urothelium is responsible for this form of cancer. This is
responsible for polychronotropism in bladder cancer i.e. the
tumour tends to recur with time and develops at new
locations within the urinary tract.
Several cytogentic abnormalities have been seen in
bladder cancer. These include mutations in p53, RB gene and
p21 gene, all of which are associated with higher rate of
recurrences and metastasis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, urothelial
tumours may be single or multiple. About 90% of the
tumours are papillary (non-invasive or invasive), whereas
the remaining 10% are flat indurated (non-invasive or
invasive) (Fig. 22.46). The papillary tumours have free
floating fern-like arrangement with a broad or narrow
pedicle. The non-papillary tumours are bulkier with
ulcerated surface (Fig. 22.47). More common locations for
either of the two types are the trigone, the region of
ureteral orifices and on the lateral walls.
Histologically, urothelial tumours are of 3 cell types—
transitional cell, squamous cell, and glandular
(Table 22.21).
Figure 22.46
Gross patterns of epithelial bladder tumours.

701
CHAPTER 22
The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tract
A. TRANSITIONAL CELL TUMOURS. Approximately
90% of all epithelial tumours of the bladder are transitional
cell tumours. As stated before, transitional cell papilloma
is distinguished by some workers from grade I transitional
cell carcinoma (TCC), whereas others do not consider this
as a distinct entity.
1.
Transitional cell papilloma. Papillomas may occur
singly or may be multiple. They are generally small, less
than 2 cm in diameter, papillary with branching pattern.
Each papilla is composed of fibrovascular stromal core
covered by normal-looking transitional cells having
normal number of layers (upto 6-7) in thickness. The
individual cells resemble the normal transitional cells and
do not vary in size and shape. Mitoses are absent and basal
polarity is retained. It must be emphasised that the
designation transitional cell papilloma is purely a histo-
logical diagnosis but does not imply an innocent biologic
behaviour. In fact, it may recur and behave in a malignant
manner.
2. Carcinoma in situ (CIS). Foci of epithelial hyperplasia,
dysplasia and carcinoma in situ are seen in other parts of
the bladder in non-invasive as well as in invasive
carcinomas. Similar foci may be present in the ureters and
renal pelvis. The malignant potential of epithelial
hyperplasia and dysplasia is uncertain but carcinoma in
situ is certainly precancerous and is currently included as
grade 0 transitional cell carcinoma. Carcinoma in situ is
characterised by anaplastic malignant cells confined to
layers superficial to basement membrane of the bladder
mucosa. These pathologic changes can be induced in
experimental animals by chemical carcinogens. Therefore,
it is reasonable to assume that these stages are precursors
of invasive bladder cancer.
3.
Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). This is the commo-
nest cancer of the bladder. The widely accepted
classification of Mostofi (1960) adopted by the American
Bladder Tumour Registry divides TCC into 3 grades. The
basis for this grading depends upon 2 features: the degree
of anaplasia and the extent of invasion.
The criteria for anaplasia are: increased cellularity,
nuclear crowding, deranged cellular polarity, failure of
normal orientation from base to the surface, variation in
cell size and shape, variation in nuclear chromatin pattern,
mitotic figures and giant cells.
The criteria for invasion in papillary as well as non-
papillary tumours are: penetration of the basement
membrane of bladder mucosa.
Based on these salient features, the characteristics of
three grades of transitional cell carcinoma are as under:
Grade I: The tumour cells are clearly transitional type but
show increased number of layers of cells (c.f. transitional
cell papilloma). The individual cells are generally regular
but are slightly larger and show mild hyperchromatism.
Grade II: The tumour cells are still recognisable as of
transitional cell origin and the number of layers of cells is
increased. The individual tumour cells are less regular,
larger in size, and show pronounced nuclear
hyperchromatism, mitotic activity and loss of polarity. The
tumour may or may not be invasive (Fig.22.48).
Grade III: This is the anaplastic or undifferentiated grade
of the tumour which is always invasive extending into
the bladder wall to variable depth depending upon the
clinical stage (described later). The tumour cells are no
longer recognisable as of transitional origin. The
individual tumour cells show pronounced features of
anaplasia such as marked pleomorphism, hyperchro-
matism, total loss of polarity with loosened surface cells
exfoliated in the bladder lumen.
There may be foci of squamous or glandular
metaplasia in any grade of the tumour.
B. SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA. Squamous cell
carcinoma comprises about 5% of the bladder carcinomas.
Unlike TCC which is mostly papillary and non-ulcerating,
most squamous carcinomas of the bladder are sessile,
nodular, infiltrating and ulcerating. Association of
squamous carcinoma and schistosomiasis has already
been highlighted. The carcinoma may be well-
differentiated with keratin pearl formation, or may be
anaplastic.

Systemic Pathology
C. ADENOCARCINOMA. Adenocarcinoma of the
bladder is rare. Adenocarcinoma has association with
exostrophy of the bladder with glandular metaplasia, or
may arise from urachal rests, periurethral and
periprostatic glands, or from cystitis cystica. The tumour
is characterised by glandular and tubular pattern with or
without mucus production.
STAGING OF BLADDER CANCER. The clinical behaviour
and prognosis of bladder cancer can be assessed by the
following simple staging system:
Stage 0: Carcinoma confined to the mucosa.
Stage A: Carcinoma invades the lamina propria but not the
muscularis.
Stage B1: Carcinoma invades the superficial muscle layer.
Stage B2: Carcinoma invades the deep muscle layer.
Stage C: Carcinoma invades the perivesical tissues.
Stage D1: Carcinoma shows regional metastases.
Stage D2: Carcinoma shows distant metastases.
Non-epithelial Bladder Tumours
These may be benign or malignant.
BENIGN. The most common benign mesenchymal tumour
of the bladder is leiomyoma. Other less common examples
are neurofibroma, haemangioma and granular cell
myoblastoma.
MALIGNANT. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most frequent
malignant mesenchymal tumour. It exists in 2 forms:
Adult form occurring in adults over 40 years of age and
resembles the rhabdomyosarcoma of skeletal muscle.
Childhood form occurring in infancy and childhood and
appears as large polypoid, soft, fleshy, grapelike mass
and is also called sarcoma botryoides or embryonal rhabdo-
Figure 22.48
Transitional cell carcinoma, grade II. There is increase in the number of layers of epithelium. The cells are still recognisable as
of transitional origin and show features of anaplasia.
myosarcoma. It is morphologically characterised by
masses of embryonic mesenchyme consisting of masses
of highly pleomorphic stellate cells in myxomatous
background. Similar tumours occur in the female genital
tract (Chapter 24).
TUMOURS OF RENAL PELVIS AND URETERS
Almost all the tumours of the renal pelvis and ureters are of
epithelial origin. They are of the same types as are seen in
the urinary bladder. However, tumours in the ureters are
quite rare.
TUMOURS OF URETHRA
Tumours of the urethra are rare except for the urethral
caruncle which is a tumour-like lesion.
URETHRAL CARUNCLE. Urethral caruncle is not
uncommon. It is an inflammatory lesion present on external
urethral meatus in elderly females.
Grossly, the caruncle appears as a solitary, 1 to 2 cm in
diameter, pink or red mass, protruding from urethral
meatus. It is quite friable and ulcerated.
Microscopically, the mass may be covered by squamous
or transitional epithelium or there may be ulcerated
surface. The underlying tissues show proliferating blood
vessels, fibroblastic connective tissue and intense acute
and chronic inflammatory infiltrate. Thus, the histologic
appearance closely resembles a pyogenic granuloma.
URETHRAL CARCINOMA. Carcinoma of the urethra is
uncommon. In most cases it occurs in the distal urethra near
the external meatus and thus is commonly squamous cell
carcinoma. Less often, there may be transitional cell
carcinoma or adenocarcinoma arising from periurethral
glands.

TESTIS AND EPIDIDYMIS
NORMAL STRUCTURE
Contents of the scrotal sac include the testicle and epididymis
along with lower end of the spermatic cord and the tunica
vaginalis that forms the outer serous investing layer. The
epididymis is attached to body of the testis posteriorly. Thus,
the testicle and epididymis may be regarded as one organ.
Structurally, the main components of the testicle are the
seminiferous tubules which when uncoiled are of
considerable length.
Histologically, the seminiferous tubules are formed of a
lamellar connective tissue membrane and contain several
layers of cells (Fig. 23.1,A). In the adult, the cells lining the
seminiferous tubules are of 2 types:
1.
Spermatogonia or germ cells which produce spermatocytes
(primary and secondary), spermatids and mature
spermatozoa.
2.
Sertoli cells which are larger and act as supportive cells
to germ cells, produce mainly androgen (testosterone) and
little oestrogen.
The seminiferous tubules drain into collecting ducts
which form the rete testis from where the secretions pass
into the vasa efferentia. Vasa efferentia opens at the upper
end of the epididymis. The lower end of the epididymis is
prolonged into a thick muscular tube, the vas deferens,  that
transports the secretions into the urethra.
The fibrovascular stroma present between the
seminiferous tubules contains varying number of interstitial
cells of Leydig. Leydig cells have abundant cytoplasm
containing lipid granules and elongated Reinke’s crystals.
These cells are the main source of testosterone and other
androgenic hormones in males. Thus, Sertoli and Leydig cells
are hormone-producing cells homologous to their ovarian
counterparts (granulosa-theca cells) and are termed specialised
stromal cells of the gonads.
Thus, the main functions of the testis are to produce
sperms and testosterone.
CONGENITAL ANOMALIES
Cryptorchidism
Cryptorchidism or undescended testis is a condition in which
the testicle is arrested at some point along its descent. Its
incidence is about 0.2% in adult male population. In 70% of
cases, the undescended testis lies in the inguinal ring, in 25%
in the abdomen and, in the remaining 5%, it may be present
at other sites along its descent from intra-abdominal location
to the scrotal sac.
ETIOLOGY. The exact etiology is not known in majority of
cases. However, a few apparent causes associated with
cryptorchidism are as under:
1.
Mechanical factors e.g. short spermatic cord, narrow
inguinal canal, adhesions to the peritoneum.
2.
Genetic factors e.g. trisomy 13, maldevelopment of the
scrotum or cremaster muscles.
3.
Hormonal factors e.g. deficient androgenic secretions.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Cryptorchidism is unila-
teral in 80% cases and bilateral in the rest.
Grossly, the cryptorchid testis is small in size, firm and
fibrotic.
Histologically, contrary to previous beliefs, the changes
of atrophy begin to appear by about 2 years of age. These
changes are as under (Fig. 23.1,B):
1.
Seminiferous tubules: There is progressive loss of germ
cell elements so that the tubules may be lined by only
spermatogonia 
and 
spermatids 
but 
foci 
of
spermatogenesis are discernible in 10% of cases. The
tubular basement membrane is thickened. Advanced
cases show hyalinised tubules with a few Sertoli cells only,
surrounded by prominent basement membrane.
2.
Interstitial stroma: There is usually increase in the
interstitial fibrovascular stroma and conspicuous presence
of Leydig cells, seen singly or in small clusters.
CLINICAL FEATURES. As such, cryptorchidism is comp-
letely asymptomatic and is discovered only on physical
examination. However, if surgical correction by orchiopexy
is not undertaken by about 2 years of age, or certainly in the
prepubertal period, significant adverse clinical outcome may
result as under:
1.
Sterility-infertility. Bilateral cryptorchidism is associa-
ted with sterility while unilateral disease may result in
infertility.
2.
Inguinal hernia. A concomitant inguinal hernia is
frequently present along with cryptorchidism.
3.
Malignancy. Cryptorchid testis is at 30-50 times increa-
sed risk of developing testicular malignancy, most commonly
seminoma and embryonal carcinoma, than a normally
descended testis. The risk of malignancy is greater in intra-
abdominal testis than in testis in the inguinal canal for the
simple reason that the neoplastic process in the testis in
scrotal location is detected early than intra-abdominal site.

704
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Male Infertility
The morphologic pattern of testicular atrophy described
above for cryptorchidism can result from various other
causes of male infertility. These causes can be divided into 3
groups: pre-testicular, testicular and post-testicular.
A. PRE-TESTICULAR CAUSES:
1.
Hypopituitarism. Pre-pubertal or post-pubertal hypo-
pituitarism such as from tumour, trauma, infarction, cyst and
genetic deficiency of FSH and LH secretion.
2.
Oestrogen excess. Endogenous excess such as from hepatic
cirrhosis, adrenal tumour, Sertoli and Leydig cell tumour;
or exogenous excess such as in the treatment of carcinoma of
the prostate.
3.
Glucocorticoid excess. Endogenous excess may occur in
Cushing’s syndrome while exogenous excess may occur in
the treatment of ulcerative colitis, bronchial asthma,
rheumatoid arthritis etc.
4.
Other endocrine disorders. Hypothyroidism and
diabetes mellitus are associated with hypospermatogenesis.
B. TESTICULAR CAUSES:
1.
Agonadism i.e. total absence of the testes.
2.
Cryptorchidism or undescended testis described above.
3.
Maturation arrest i.e. failure of spermatogenesis beyond
one of the immature stages.
4.
Hypospermatogenesis i.e. presence of all the maturation
stages of spermatogenesis but in decreased number.
5.
Sertoli cell-only syndrome. Congenital or acquired
absence of all germ cells so that the seminiferous tubules are
lined by Sertoli cells only.
6.
Klinefelter’s syndrome. An XXY intersexuality charac-
terised by primary hypogonadism, azoospermia, gynaeco-
mastia, eunuchoid built and subnormal intelligence.
7.
Mumps orchitis occurring as a complication of parotitis
(Chapter 19).
8.
Irradiation damage resulting in permanent germ cell
destruction.
C. POST-TESTICULAR CAUSES:
1.
Congenital block e.g. absence or atresia of vas deferens.

INFLAMMATIONS
Inflammation of the testis is termed as orchitis and of
epididymis is called as epididymitis; the latter being more
common. A combination epididymo-orchitis may also occur.
A few important types are described below.
Non-specific Epididymitis and Orchitis
Non-specific epididymitis and orchitis, or their combination,
may be acute or chronic. The common routes of spread of
infection are via the vas deferens, or via lymphatic and
haematogenous routes. Most frequently, the infection is
caused by urethritis, cystitis, prostatitis and seminal
vesiculitis. Other causes are mumps, smallpox, dengue fever,
influenza, pneumonia and filariasis. The common infecting
organisms in sexually-active men under 35 years of age are
Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, whereas in
older individuals the common organisms are urinary tract
pathogens like Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, in acute stage the
testicle is firm, tense, swollen and congested. There may
be multiple abscesses, especially in gonorrhoeal infection.
In chronic cases, there is usually variable degree of
atrophy and fibrosis.
Histologically, acute orchitis and epididymitis are charac-
terised by congestion, oedema and diffuse infiltration by
neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages
or formation of neutrophilic abscesses. Acute
inflammation may resolve, or may progress to chronic
form. In chronic epididymo-orchitis, there is focal or
diffuse chronic inflammation, disappearance of
seminiferous tubules, fibrous scarring and destruction of
interstitial Leydig cells. Such cases usually result in
permanent sterility.
Granulomatous (Autoimmune) Orchitis
Non-tuberculous granulomatous orchitis is a peculiar type
of unilateral, painless testicular enlargement in middle-aged
men that may resemble a testicular tumour clinically. The
exact etiology and pathogenesis of the condition are not
known though an autoimmune basis is suspected.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the affected testis
is enlarged with thickened tunica. Cut section of the
testicle is greyish-white to tan-brown.
Histologically, there are circumscribed non-caseating
granulomas lying within the seminiferous tubules. These
granulomas are composed of epithelioid cells, lympho-
cytes, plasma cells, some neutrophils and multinucleate
giant cells. The origin of the epithelioid cells is from Sertoli
cells lining the tubules. The tubules show peritubular
fibrosis which merges into the interstitial tissue that is
infiltrated by lymphocytes and plasma cells.
Tuberculous Epididymo-orchitis
Tuberculosis invariably begins in the epididymis and
spreads to involve the testis. Tuberculous epididymo-orchitis
is generally secondary tuberculosis from elsewhere in the
body. It may occur either by direct spread from genitourinary
tuberculosis such as tuberculous seminal vesiculitis,
prostatitis and renal tuberculosis, or may reach by
haematogenous spread of infection such as from tuberculosis
of the lungs. Primary genital tuberculosis may occur rarely.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, discrete,
yellowish, caseous necrotic areas are seen.
Microscopically, numerous tubercles which may coalesce
to form large caseous mass are seen. Characteristics of
typical tubercles such as epithelioid cells, peripheral
mantle of lymphocytes, occasional multinucleate giant
cells and central areas of caseation necrosis are seen
(Fig. 23.2). Numerous acid-fast bacilli can be
demonstrated by Ziehl-Neelsen staining. The lesions
produce extensive destruction of the epididymis and may
form chronic discharging sinuses on the scrotal skin. In
late stage, the lesions heal by fibrous scarring and may
undergo calcification.
Spermatic Granuloma
Spermatic granuloma is the term used for development of
inflammatory lesions due to invasion of spermatozoa into
the stroma. Spermatic granuloma may develop due to
trauma, inflammation and loss of ligature following
vasectomy.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the sperm granu-
loma is a small nodule, 3 mm to 3 cm in diameter, firm,
white to yellowish-brown.
Figure 23.2
Tuberculous epididymo-orchitis. The interstitium
contains several epithelioid cell granulomas with central areas of
caseation necrosis. These granulomas are surrounded by  Langhans’
giant cells and mantle of lymphocytes.

706
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Histologically, it consists of a granuloma composed of
histiocytes, epithelioid cells, lymphocytes and some
neutrophils. Characteristically, the centre of spermatic
granuloma contains spermatozoa and necrotic debris. The
late lesions have fibroblastic proliferation at the periphery
and hyalinisation.
Elephantiasis
Elephantiasis is enormous thickening of the scrotal skin
resembling the elephant’s hide and results in enlargement
of the scrotum. The condition results from filariasis in which
the adult worm lives in the lymphatics, while the larvae
travel in the blood. The most important variety of filaria is
Wuchereria bancrofti. The condition is common in all tropical
countries. The vector is generally the Culex mosquito. The
patients may remain asymptomatic or may manifest with
fever, local pain, swelling, rash, tender lymphadenopathy
and blood eosinophilia. An asthma-like respiratory comp-
laint may develop in some cases.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the affected leg
and scrotum are enormously thickened with enlargement
of regional lymph nodes. The affected area of skin may
show dilated dermal lymphatics and varicosities.
Histologically, the changes begin with lymphatic
obstruction by the adult worms. The worm in alive, dead
or calcified form may be found in the dilated lymphatics
or in the lymph nodes. Dead or calcified worm in
lymphatics is usually followed by lymphangitis with
intense infiltration by eosinophils. Sometimes,
granulomatous reaction may be evident. In advanced
cases, chronic lymphoedema with tough subcutaneous
fibrosis and epidermal hyperkeratosis develops which is
termed elephantiasis.
MISCELLANEOUS LESIONS
Torsion of Testis
Torsion of the testicle may occur either in a fully-descended
testis or in an undescended testis. The latter is more common
and more severe. It results from sudden cessation of venous
drainage and arterial supply to the testis, usually following
sudden muscular effort or physical trauma. Torsion is
common in boys and young men.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The pathologic changes
vary depending upon the duration and severity of
vascular occlusion. There may be coagulative necrosis of
the testis and epididymis, or there may be haemorrhagic
infarction. The inflammatory reaction is generally not so
pronounced.
Varicocele
Varicocele is the dilatation, elongation and tortuosity of the
veins of the pampiniform plexus in the spermatic cord. It is
of 2 types: primary (idiopathic) and secondary.
Primary or idiopathic form is more frequent and is
common in young unmarried men. It is nearly always on
the left side as the loaded rectum presses the left vein.
Besides, the left spermatic vein enters the renal vein at right
angles while the right spermatic vein enters the vena cava
obliquely.
Secondary form occurs due to pressure on the spermatic
vein by enlarged liver, spleen or kidney. It is commoner in
middle-aged people.
Hydrocele
A hydrocele is abnormal collection of serous fluid in the
tunica vaginalis. It may be acute or chronic, congenital or
acquired. The usual causes are trauma, systemic oedema
such as in cardiac failure and renal disease, and as a
complication of gonorrhoea, syphilis and tuberculosis.
The hydrocele fluid is generally clear and straw-coloured
but may be slightly turbid or haemorrhagic. The hydrocele
sac may have single loculus or may have multiple loculi. The
wall of the hydrocele sac is composed of fibrous tissue
infiltrated with lymphocytes and plasma cells.
Haematocele
Haematocele is haemorrhage into the sac of the tunica
vaginalis. It may result from direct trauma, from injury to a
vein by the needle, or from haemorrhagic diseases.
In recent haematocele, the blood coagulates and the wall
is coated with ragged deposits of fibrin. In long-standing
cases, the tunica vaginalis is thickened with dense fibrous
tissue and occasionally may get partly calcified (Fig. 23.3).
TESTICULAR TUMOURS
Testicular tumours are the cause of about 1% of all cancer
deaths. They are more frequent in white male population
but are less common in Africans and Asians. They have
trimodal age distribution—a peak during infancy, another
during late adolescence and early adulthood, and a third
peak after 60 years of age.

CHAPTER 23
The Male Reproductive System and Prostate
CLASSIFICATION
The most widely accepted classification is the histogenetic
classification proposed by the World Health Organisation
(Table 23.1). Based on this, all testicular tumours are divided
into 3 groups: germ cell tumours, sex cord-stromal tumours and
mixed forms. Vast majority of the testicular tumours (95%)
arise from germ cells or their precursors in the seminiferous
tubules, while less than 5% originate from sex cord-stromal
components of the testis. From clinical point of view, germ
cell tumours of the testis are categorised into 2 main groups—
seminomatous and non-seminomatous which need to be
distinguished (Table 23.2).
ETIOLOGIC FACTORS
Exact etiology of testicular germ cell tumours is unknown,
but the following factors have been implicated:
1. Cryptorchidism. The probability of a germ cell tumour
developing in an undescended testis is 30-50 times greater
than in a normally-descended testis. About 10% of testicular
germ cell tumours are associated with cryptorchidism. The
high incidence is attributed to higher temperature to which
the undescended testis in the groin or abdomen is exposed.
Intra-abdominal testis is at greater risk than the inguinal
testis. There is increased incidence of tumour in the contra-
lateral normally-descended testis. There are no data to
confirm or deny whether surgical repositioning or
orchiopexy of a cryptorchid testis alters the incidence of
testicular tumour. However, surgical correction is still helpful
since it is easier to detect the tumour in scrotal testis than in
an abdominal or inguinal testis.
2.
Other developmental disorders. Dysgenetic gonads
associated with endocrine abnormalities such as androgen
insensitivity syndrome have higher incidence of
development of germ cell tumours.
3.
Genetic factors. Genetic factors play a role in the develop-
ment of germ cell tumours supported by the observation of
high incidence in first-degree family members, twins and in
white male populations while blacks in Africa have a very
low incidence. However, no definite pattern of inheritance
has been recognised.
4.
Other factors. A few less common factors include the
following:
i)
Orchitis. A history of mumps or other forms of orchitis
may be given by the patient with germ cell tumour.
ii) Trauma. Many patients give a history of trauma prior to
the development of the tumour but it is not certain how
trauma initiates the neoplastic process. Instead, possibly it
brings the patient to attention of the physician.
iii) Carcinogens. A number of carcinogens such as use of
certain drugs (e.g. LSD, hormonal therapy for sterility,
copper, zinc etc), exposure to radiation and endocrine abnor-
malities may play a role in the development of testicular
tumours.
HISTOGENESIS
Pathogenesis of testicular tumours remains controversial
except that vast majority of these tumours originate from
germ cells. Based on current concepts on histogenesis of
testicular tumours, following agreements and disagreements
have emerged (Fig. 23.4):
1.
Developmental disorders. Disorders such as cryptor-
chidism, gonadal dysgenesis and androgen insensitivity
syndrome are high risk factors for development of testicular
germ cell tumours. These observations point to develop-
mental defect in gonadogenesis.

Systemic Pathology
2. Molecular genetic features. Testicular germ cell tumours
have been found to have several genetic abnormalities
suggesting a common molecular pathogenesis of  all germ
cell tumours:
i) Hyperdiploidy is almost a constant feature of all germ cell
tumours of the testis.
ii) In more than 90% of testicular germ cell tumours
irrespective of histologic type (as also ovarian germ cell
tumours), an isochromosome of short arm of chromosome
12, abbreviated as i(12p), is found.
iii) Similarly, deletion of long arm of chromosome 12
abbreviated as del(12q), is present.
iv) Telomerase activity is present in all germ cell tumours of
the testis.
v) Other mutations include p53, cyclin E and FAS gene.
3.
CIS/ITGCN. A preinvasive stage of carcinoma in situ
(CIS) termed intratubular germ cell neoplasia (ITGCN) generally
precedes the development of most of the invasive testicular
germ cell tumours in adults. CIS originates from spermato-
genic elements. Areas of CIS are found in seminiferous
tubules adjacent to most seminomas, embryonal carcinomas
and other mixed germ cell tumours. However, CIS is not
found in seminiferous tubules adjoining yolk sac carcinoma
of childhood, benign teratoma in children and adolescents,
and spermatocytic seminoma indicating their different patho-
genetic mechanisms.
4.
‘Three hit’ process. Germ cells in seminiferous tubules
undergo activation (‘first hit’) before undergoing malignant
transformation confined to seminiferous tubules (CIS)
(‘second hit’) and eventually into invasive stage by some
epigenetic phenomena (‘third hit’). Though this sequential
tumorigenesis explains the development of seminomatous
tumours, it is yet not clear whether non-seminomatous germ
cell tumours develop directly or through intermediate stage.
CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS
The usual presenting clinical symptoms of testicular tumours
are gradual gonadal enlargement and a dragging sensation
in the testis. Metastatic involvement may produce secondary
symptoms such as pain, lymphadenopathy, haemoptysis and
urinary obstruction.
SPREAD. Since testicular germ cell tumours originate from
totipotent germ cells, it is not unusual to find metastases of
histologic types different from the primary growth. Testicular
tumours may spread by both lymphatic and haematogenous
routes:
Lymphatic spread occurs to retroperitoneal para-aortic
lymph nodes, mediastinal lymph nodes and supraclavicular
lymph nodes.
Haematogenous spread primarily occurs to the lungs, liver,
brain and bones.

CHAPTER 23
The Male Reproductive System and Prostate
TUMOUR MARKERS. Germ cell tumours of the testis
secrete polypeptide hormones and certain enzymes which
can be detected in the blood. Two tumour markers widely
used in the diagnosis, staging and monitoring the follow-up
of patients with testicular tumours are: human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG) and alpha-foetoprotein (AFP). In
addition, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), human placental
lactogen (HPL), placental alkaline phosphatase, testosterone,
oestrogen and luteinising hormone may also be elevated.
hCG is synthesised by placental syncytio-trophoblast
such as in various non-seminomatous germ cell tumours of
the testis (e.g. in choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumour and
embryonal carcinoma). However, ectopic hCG production
may occur in a variety of non-testicular non-germ cell
tumours as well.
AFP is normally synthesised by the foetal liver cells, yolk
sac and foetal gut. Its levels are elevated in testicular tumours
associated with yolk sac components. However, elevated
serum AFP levels are also found in liver cell carcinoma.
PROGNOSIS. For selecting post-orchiectomy treatment
(radiation, surgery, chemotherapy or all the three) and for
monitoring prognosis, 3 clinical stages are defined:
Stage I: tumour confined to the testis.
Stage II: distant spread confined to retroperitoneal lymph
nodes below the diaphragm.
Stage III: distant metastases beyond the retroperitoneal
lymph nodes.
Seminomas tend to remain localised to the testis (stage
I) while non-seminomatous germ cell tumours more often
present with advanced clinical disease (stage II and III).
Seminomas are extremely radiosensitive while non-
seminomatous germ cell tumours are radio-resistant. In
general, seminomas have a better prognosis with 90% cure
rate while the non-seminomatous tumours behave in a more
aggressive manner and have poor prognosis.
After these general comments, specific testicular tumours
are as described below.
GERM CELL TUMOURS
Germ cell tumours comprise approximately 95% of all
testicular tumours and are more frequent before the age of
45 years. Testicular germ cell tumours are almost always
malignant. Nearly half of them contain more than one
histologic type. Germ cell tumours are also found at the
extragonadal sites such as the retroperitoneum and media-
stinum, besides their counterparts in the female gonads (page
745).
Intratubular Germ Cell Neoplasia
The term intratubular germ cell neoplasia (ITGCN) is used
to describe the preinvasive stage of germ cell tumours,
notably intratubular seminoma and intratubular embryonal
carcinoma. Others have used carcinoma in situ (CIS) stage
of germ cell tumours as synonymous term.
Histologically, the malignant atypical tumour cells are
restricted to the seminiferous tubules without evident
invasion into the interstitium.
Classic Seminoma
Seminoma is the commonest malignant tumour of the testis
and corresponds to dysgerminoma in the female (page 747).
It constitutes about 45% of all germ cell tumours, and in
another 15% comprises the major component of mixed germ
cell tumour. Seminoma is divided into 2 main categories:
classic and spermatocytic. Classic seminoma comprises about
93% of all seminomas and has a peak incidence in the 4th
decade of life and is rare before puberty. Undescended testis
harbours seminoma more frequently as compared to other
germ cell tumours. About 10% pure seminomas are
associated with elevated hCG levels in serum.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the involved
testis is enlarged up to 10 times its normal size but tends
to maintain its normal contour since the tumour rarely
invades the tunica. The larger tumour replaces the entire
testis, whereas the smaller tumour appears as
circumscribed mass in the testis. Cut section of the affected
testis shows homogeneous, grey-white lobulated
appearance (Fig. 23.5). Necrosis and haemorrhage in the
tumour are rare.
Microscopically,  the tumour has the following charac-
teristics (Fig. 23.6):
Figure 23.5
Seminoma testis. The testis is enlarged but without
distorting its contour. Sectioned surface shows replacement of the entire
testis by lobulated, homogeneous, grey-white mass.

710
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
1. Tumour cells. The seminoma cells generally lie in cords,
sheets or columns forming lobules. Typically, in a classic
seminoma, the tumour cells are fairly uniform in size with
clear cytoplasm and well-defined cell borders. The cyto-
plasm contains variable amount of glycogen that stains
positively with PAS reaction. The nuclei are centrally
located, large, hyperchromatic and usually contain 1-2
prominent nucleoli. Tumour giant cells may be present.
Mitotic figures are infrequent. However, about 10% of
seminomas have increased mitotic activity and have
aggressive behaviour and are categorised as anaplastic
seminomas.
2. Stroma. The stroma of seminoma is delicate fibrous
tissue which divides the tumour into lobules. The stroma
shows a characteristic lymphocytic infiltration, indicative
of immunologic response of the host to the tumour. About
20% of the tumours show granulomatous reaction in the
stroma.
The prognosis of classic seminoma is better than other
germ cell tumours. The tumour is highly radiosensitive.
Natural history of anaplastic seminoma, however, is
unclear—perhaps it represents an advanced stage of classic
seminoma with a more aggressive behaviour.
Spermatocytic Seminoma
Spermatocytic seminoma is both clinically and
morphologically a distinctive tumour from classic seminoma
and is, therefore, classified separately in the WHO
classification. It is an uncommon tumour having an incidence
of about 5% of all germ cell tumours. Spermatocytic
seminoma usually occurs in older patients, generally in 6th
decade of life. The tumour is bilateral in 10% of patients.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, spermatocytic
seminoma is homogeneous, larger, softer and more
yellowish and gelatinous than the classic seminoma.
Histologically, the distinctive features are as under:
1. Tumour cells. The tumour cells vary considerably in
size from lymphocyte-like to huge mononucleate or
multinucleate giant cells. Majority of the tumour cells are,
however, of intermediate size. The cells have eosinophilic
cytoplasm devoid of glycogen. The nuclei of intermediate
and large cells have filamentous pattern. Mitoses are often
frequent.
2. Stroma. The stroma lacks lymphocytic and granulo-
matous reaction seen in classic seminoma.
The prognosis of spermatocytic seminoma is excellent
compared and better than classic seminoma since the tumour
is slow-growing and rarely metastasises. The tumour is
radiosensitive.
Embryonal Carcinoma
Pure embryonal carcinoma constitutes 30% of germ cell
tumours but areas of embryonal carcinoma are present in
40% of germ cell tumours. These tumours are more common
in 2nd to 3rd decades of life. About 90% cases are associated
with elevation of AFP or hCG or both. They are more
aggressive than the seminomas.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, embryonal carci-
noma is usually a small tumour in the testis. It distorts
the contour of the testis as it frequently invades the tunica
and the epididymis. Cut surface of the tumour is grey-
white, soft with areas of haemorrhages and necrosis.
Microscopically, the following features are seen:
1.
The tumour cells are arranged in a variety of patterns—
glandular, tubular, papillary and solid.
2.
The tumour cells are highly anaplastic carcinomatous
cells having large size, indistinct cell borders, amphophilic
cytoplasm and prominent hyperchromatic nuclei showing
considerable variation in nuclear size. Mitotic figures and

711
CHAPTER 23
The Male Reproductive System and Prostate
tumour giant cells are frequently present. Haemorrhage
and necrosis are common.
3.
The stroma is not as distinct as in seminoma and may
contain variable amount of primitive mesenchyme.
Embryonal carcinoma is more aggressive and less
radiosensitive than seminoma. Chemotherapy is more
effective in treating this tumour.
Yolk Sac Tumour
(Synonyms: Endodermal Sinus Tumour,
Orchioblastoma, Infantile Embryonal Carcinoma)
This characteristic tumour is the most common testicular
tumour of infants and young children upto the age of 4 years.
In adults, however, yolk sac tumour in pure form is rare but
may be present as the major component in 40% of germ cell
tumours. AFP levels are elevated in 100% cases of yolk sac
tumours.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
generally soft, yellow-white, mucoid with areas of necrosis
and haemorrhages.
Microscopically, yolk sac tumour has the following
features (Fig. 23.7):
1.
The tumour cells form a variety of patterns—loose
reticular network, papillary, tubular and solid arrange-
ment.
2.
The tumour cells are flattened to cuboid epithelial cells
with clear vacuolated cytoplasm.
3.
The tumour cells may form distinctive perivascular
structures resembling the yolk sac or endodermal sinuses
of the rat placenta called Schiller-Duval bodies.
4.
There may be presence of both intracellular and
extracellular PAS-positive hyaline globules, many of which
contain AFP.
Polyembryoma
Polyembryoma is defined as a tumour composed predo-
minantly of embryoid bodies. Embryoid bodies are structures
containing a disc and cavities surrounded by loose
mesenchyme simulating an embryo of about 2 weeks’
gestation. Polyembryoma is extremely rare but embryoid
bodies may be present with embryonal carcinoma and
teratoma.
Choriocarcinoma
Pure choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant tumour compo-
sed of elements consisting of syncytiotrophoblast and
cytotrophoblast.
However, pure form is extremely rare and occurs more
often in combination with other germ cell tumours. The
patients are generally in their 2nd decade of life. The primary
tumour is usually small and the patient may manifest initially
with symptoms of metastasis. The serum and urinary levels
of hCG are greatly elevated in 100% cases.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
usually small and may appear as a soft, haemorrhagic and
necrotic mass.
Microscopically, the characteristic feature is the
identification of intimately related syncytiotrophoblast
and cytotrophoblast without formation of definite
placental-type villi.
Syncytiotrophoblastic cells are large with many irregular
and bizarre nuclei and abundant eosinophilic vacuolated
cytoplasm which stains positively for hCG. These cells
often surround masses of cytotrophoblastic cells.
Cytotrophoblastic cells are polyhedral cells which are
more regular and have clear or eosinophilic cytoplasm
with hyperchromatic nuclei.
Teratoma
Teratomas are complex tumours composed of tissues derived
from more than one of the three germ cell layers—endoderm,
mesoderm and ectoderm. Testicular teratomas are more
common in infants and children and constitute about 40%
of testicular tumours in infants, whereas in adults they
comprise 5% of all germ cell tumours. However, teratomas
are found in combination with other germ cell tumours (most
commonly with embryonal carcinoma) in about 45% of
mixed germ cell tumours. About half the teratomas have
elevated hCG or AFP levels or both.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Testicular teratomas are
classified into 3 types:
1. Mature (differentiated) teratoma
2. Immature teratoma
3. Teratoma with malignant transformation.
Figure 23.7
Yolk sac tumour testis. The tumour has microcystic
pattern and has highly anaplastic tumour cells. Several characteristic
Schiller-Duval bodies are present. Inset shows intra- and extracellular
hyaline globules.

712
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Grossly, most teratomas are large, grey-white masses
enlarging the involved testis. Cut surface shows
characteristic variegated appearance—grey-white solid
areas, cystic and honey-combed areas, and foci of cartilage
and bone (Fig. 23.8). Dermoid tumours commonly seen
in the ovaries are rare in testicular teratomas.
Microscopically, the three categories of teratomas show
different appearances:
1.
Mature (differentiated) teratoma. Mature teratoma is
composed of disorderly mixture of a variety of well-
differentiated structures such as cartilage, smooth muscle,
intestinal and respiratory epithelium, mucus glands, cysts
lined by squamous and transitional epithelium, neural
tissue, fat and bone. This type of mature or differentiated
teratoma is the most common, seen more frequently in
infants and children and has favourable prognosis.
However, similar mature and benign-appearing tumour
in adults is invariably associated with small hidden foci
of immature elements so that their clinical course in adults
is unpredictable. It is believed that all testicular teratomas
in the adults are malignant.
As mentioned above, dermoid cysts similar to those
of the ovary are rare in the testis.
2.
Immature teratoma. Immature teratoma is composed
of incompletely differentiated and primitive or embryonic
tissues along with some mature elements (Fig. 23.9).
Primitive or embryonic tissue commonly present are
poorly-formed cartilage, mesenchyme, neural tissues,
abortive eye, intestinal and respiratory tissue elements etc.
Mitoses are usually frequent.
Figure 23.8
Immature teratoma testis. The testis is enlarged and nodular distorting the testicular contour. Sectioned surface shows replacement
of the entire testis by variegated mass having grey-white solid areas, cystic areas, honey-combed areas and foci of cartilage and bone.

713
CHAPTER 23
The Male Reproductive System and Prostate
3. Teratoma with malignant transformation. This is an
extremely rare form of teratoma in which one or more of
the tissue elements show malignant transformation. Such
malignant change resembles morphologically with typical
malignancies in other organs and tissues and commonly
includes rhabdomyosarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma
and adenocarcinoma.
Mixed Germ Cell Tumours
About 60% of germ cell tumours have more than one of the
above histologic types (except spermatocytic seminoma) and
are called mixed germ cell tumours. The clinical behaviour
of these tumours is worsened by inclusion of more aggressive
tumour component in a less malignant tumour. Interestingly,
metastases of the mixed germ cell tumours may not exactly
reproduce the histologic types present in the primary
tumour.
The most common combinations of mixed germ cell
tumours are as under:
1.
Teratoma, embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumour and
syncytiotrophoblast.
2.
Embryonal carcinoma and teratoma (teratocarcinoma).
3.
Seminoma and embryonal carcinoma.
SEX CORD-STROMAL TUMOURS
Tumours arising from specialised gonadal stroma are classi-
fied on the basis of histogenesis. The primitive mesenchyme
which forms the specialised stroma of gonads in either sex
gives rise to theca, granulosa and lutein cells in the female,
and Sertoli and interstitial Leydig cells in the male. Since the
cell of origin of primitive mesenchyme is identical, Sertoli
and interstitial Leydig cell tumours may occur in the ovaries
(in addition to theca cell, granulosa cell and lutein cell
tumours). Likewise, the latter three tumours may occur in
the testis (in addition to Sertoli cell and Leydig cell tumours).
All these tumours secrete various hormones. The biologic
behaviour of these tumours generally cannot be determined
on histological grounds alone but is related to clinical
parameters and hormonal elaboration by these tumours.
Leydig (Interstitial) Cell  Tumour
Leydig cell tumours are quite uncommon. They may occur
at any age but are more frequent in the age group of 20 to 50
years. Characteristically, these cells secrete androgen, or both
androgen and oestrogen, and rarely corticosteroids. Bilateral
tumours may occur typically in congenital adrenogenital
syndrome.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour
appears as a small, well-demarcated and lobulated
nodule. Cut surface is homogeneously yellowish or
brown.
Histologically, the tumour is composed of sheets and
cords of normal-looking Leydig cells. These cells contain
abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and Reinke’s crystals
and a small central nucleus.
Most of Leydig cell tumours are benign. Only about 10%
may invade and metastasise.
Sertoli Cell Tumours (Androblastoma)
Sertoli cell tumours correspond to arrhenoblastoma of the
ovary. They may occur at all ages but are more frequent in
infants and children. These tumours may elaborate oestrogen
or androgen and may account for gynaecomastia in an adult,
or precocious sexual development in a child.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
fairly large, firm, round, and well circumscribed. Cut
surface of the tumour is yellowish or yellow-grey.
Microscopically, Sertoli cell tumour is composed of
benign Sertoli cells arranged in well-defined tubules.
Majority of Sertoli cell tumours are benign but about 10%
may metastasise to regional lymph nodes.
Granulosa Cell Tumour
This is an extremely rare tumour in the testis and resembles
morphologically with its ovarian counterpart (Chapter 24).
MIXED GERM CELL-SEX CORD STROMAL TUMOURS
An example of combination of both germ cells and sex cord
stromal components is gonadoblastoma.
Gonadoblastoma
Dysgenetic gonads and undescended testis are predisposed
to develop such combined proliferations of germ cells and
sex cord-stromal elements. The patients are commonly
intersexuals, particularly phenotypic females. Most of the
gonadoblastomas secrete androgen and therefore produce
virilisation in female phenotype. A few, however, secrete
oestrogen.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is of
variable size, yellowish-white and soft.
Microscopically, gonadoblastoma is composed of 2
principal cell types—large germ cells resembling
seminoma cells, and small cells resembling immature
Sertoli, Leydig and granulosa cells. Call-Exner bodies of
a granulosa cell tumour may be present.
Prognosis largely depends upon the malignant potential
of the type of germ cell components included.
OTHER TUMOURS
Malignant Lymphoma
Malignant lymphomas comprises 5% of testicular malignan-
cies and is the most common testicular tumour in the elderly.
Bilaterality is seen in half the cases. Most common are large
cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma of B cell type.
Rare Tumours
In addition to the testicular tumours described above, some
other uncommon tumours in this location include: plasma-
cytoma, leukaemic infiltration, carcinoid tumour,
haemangioma, primary sarcomas and metastatic tumours.

714
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
PENIS
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The penis is covered by skin, foreskin (prepuce) and strati-
fied squamous mucosa. The structure of penis consists of 3
masses of erectile tissue— two corpora cavernosa, one on
each side dorsally, and the corpus spongiosum ventrally
through which the urethra passes. The expanded free end of
the corpus spongiosum forms the glans.
The lumen of the urethra in sectioned surface of the penis
appears as an irregular cleft in the middle of the corpus
spongiosum. In the prostatic part, it is lined by transitional
epithelium, but elsewhere it is lined by columnar epithelium
except near its orifice where stratified squamous epithelium
lines it.
CONGENITAL ANOMALIES
Phimosis
Phimosis is a condition in which the prepuce is too small to
permit its normal retraction behind the glans. It may be
congenital or acquired. Congenital phimosis is a developmental
anomaly whereas acquired phimosis may result from
inflammation, trauma or oedema leading to narrowing of
preputial opening. In either case, phimosis interferes with
cleanliness and predisposes to the development of secondary
infection, preputial calculi and squamous cell carcinoma.
Paraphimosis is a condition in which the phimotic pre-
puce is forcibly retracted resulting in constriction over the
glans penis and subsequent swelling.
Hypospadias and Epispadias
Hypospadias is a developmental defect of the urethra in which
the urethral meatus fails to reach the end of the penis, but
instead, opens on the ventral surface of the penis. Similar
developmental defect with resultant urethral opening on the
dorsal surface of the penis is termed epispadias. Hypospadias
and epispadias may cause urethral constriction with
consequent infection and may also interfere with normal
ejaculation and insemination. Both these urethral anomalies
are more frequently associated with cryptorchidism.
INFLAMMATIONS
Glans and prepuce are frequently involved in inflammation
in a number of specific and non-specific conditions. The
specific inflammations include various sexually-transmitted
diseases such as hard chancre in syphilis, chancroid caused
by Haemophilus ducreyi, gonorrhoea caused by gonococci,
herpes progenitalis, granuloma inguinale (donovanosis), and
lymphopathia venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.
Balanoposthitis
Balanoposthitis is the term used for non-specific inflam-
mation of the inner surface of the prepuce (balanitis) and
adjacent surface of the glans (posthitis). It is caused by a
variety of microorganisms such as staphylococci,
streptococci, coliform bacilli and gonococci. Balanoposthitis
usually results from lack of cleanliness resulting in
accumulation of secretions and smegma. It is a common
accompaniment of phimosis. The type of inflammation may
be acute or chronic, sometimes with ulceration on the
mucosal surface of the glans.
Balanitis Xerotica Obliterans
Balanitis xerotica obliterans is a white atrophic lesion on the
glans penis and the prepuce and is a counterpart of the lichen
sclerosus et atrophicus in the vulva described on page 721.
TUMOURS
Benign and malignant tumours as well as certain premalig-
nant lesions may occur on the penis. These are discussed
below:
BENIGN  TUMOURS
Condyloma Acuminatum
Condyloma acuminatum or anogenital wart is a benign
tumour caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) types 6
and 11. The tumour may occur singly, or there may be
conglomerated papillomas. A more extensive, solitary,
exophytic and cauliflower-like warty mass is termed giant
condyloma or Buschke-Löwenstein tumour or verrucous
carcinoma.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The condyloma is
commonly located on the coronal sulcus on the penis or
the perineal area.
Grossly, the tumour consists of solitary or multiple, warty,
cauliflower-shaped lesions of variable size with exophytic
growth pattern.
Histologically, the lesions are essentially like common
warts (verruca vulgaris). The features include formation
of papillary villi composed of connective tissue stroma
and covered by squamous epithelium which shows
hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, and hyperplasia of prickle
cell layer. Many of the prickle cells show clear
vacuolisation of the cytoplasm (koilocytosis) indicative of
HPV infection.
Giant condyloma shows upward as well as downward
growth of the tumour but is otherwise histologically identi-
cal to condyloma acuminatum. Though histologically benign,
clinically the giant condyloma is associated with recurrences
and behaves as intermediate between truly benign
condyloma acuminatum and squamous cell carcinoma.
PREMALIGNANT LESIONS (CARCINOMA IN SITU)
In the region of external male genitalia, three lesions display
cytological changes of malignancy confined to epithelial
layers only without evidence of invasion. These conditions
are: Bowen’s disease, erythroplasia of Queyrat and bowenoid
papulosis.
Bowen’s Disease
Bowen’s disease is located on the shaft of the penis and the
scrotum besides the sun-exposed areas of the skin (page 782).

715
CHAPTER 23
The Male Reproductive System and Prostate
Grossly, it appears as a solitary, circumscribed plaque
lesion with ulceration.
Histologically, the changes are superficial to the dermo-
epidermal border. The epithelial cells of the epidermis
show hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis and
scattered bizarre dyskeratotic cells.
A fair proportion of cases of Bowen’s disease are
associated with internal visceral cancers.
Erythroplasia of Queyrat
The lesions of erythroplasia of Queyrat appear on the penile
mucosa.
Grossly, the lesions are pink, shiny and velvety soft.
Histologically, the thickened and acanthotic epidermis
shows variable degree of dysplasia.
Unlike Bowen’s disease, there is no relationship
between erythroplasia of Queyrat and internal
malignancy.
Bowenoid Papulosis
The lesions of bowenoid papulosis appear on the penile shaft
and adjacent genital skin.
Grossly, they are solitary or multiple, shiny, red-brown
papular lesions.
Histologically, there is orderly maturation of epithelial
cells in hyperplastic epidermis with scattered hyper-
chromatic nuclei and dysplastic cells.
MALIGNANT  TUMOURS
Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The incidence of penile carcinoma shows wide variation in
different populations. In the United States, the overall
incidence of penile cancer is less than 1% of all cancers in
males but it is 3-4 times more common in blacks than in
whites. In some Asian, African and Latin American countries,
its incidence is about 10% of all cancers. Relationship of
penile cancer with HPV has been well supported; high-risk

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
HPV types 16 and 18 are strongly implicated and their DNA
has been documented in the nuclei of malignant cells.
Carcinoma of the penis is quite rare in Jews and Muslims
who undergo a ritual of circumcision early in life. In India,
cancer of the penis is rare in Muslims who practice circum-
cision as a religious rite in infancy, whereas Hindus who do
not normally circumcise have higher incidence. Circumcision
provides protection against penile cancer due to prevention
of accumulation of smegma which is believed to be
carcinogenic. The greatest incidence of penile cancer is
between 45 and 60 years.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
located, in decreasing frequency, on frenum, prepuce,
glans and coronal sulcus. The tumour may be cauliflower-
like and papillary, or flat and ulcerating (Fig. 23.10).
Histologically, squamous cell carcinoma of both
fungating and ulcerating type is generally well differen-
tiated to moderately-differentiated type which resembles
in morphology to similar cancer elsewhere in the body
(Fig. 23.11).
The tumour metastasises via lymphatics to regional
lymph nodes. Visceral metastases by haematogenous route
are uncommon and occur in advanced cases only.
PROSTATE
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The prostate gland in the normal adult weighs approximately
20 gm. It surrounds the commencement of the male urethra
and is composed of 5 lobes during embryonic development—
anterior, middle, posterior and two lateral lobes. But at birth,
the five lobes fuse to form 3 distinct lobes—two major lateral
lobes and a small median lobe (Fig. 23.12,A).
Histologically, the prostate is composed of tubular alveoli
(acini) embedded in fibromuscular tissue mass. The
glandular epithelium forms infoldings and consists of 2
layers—a basal layer of low cuboidal cells and an inner layer
of mucus-secreting tall columnar cells. The alveoli are
separated by thick fibromuscular septa containing abundant
smooth muscle fibres.
Figure 23.12
Normal prostate, benign nodular hyperplasia and prostatic carcinoma. The nodule in case of benign nodular hyperplasia (B) is
located in the inner periurethral part and compresses the prostatic urethra while prostatic carcinoma (C) generally arises in the peripheral glands
and, thus, does not compress the urethra.
The prostate has numerous blood vessels and nerves. In
addition to nervous control, the prostate is an endocrine-
dependent organ. Based on hormonal responsiveness, the
prostate is divided into 2 separate parts:
the inner periurethral female part which is sensitive to
oestrogen and androgen; and
outer subcapsular true male part which is sensitive to
androgen.
Prostate is involved in 3 important pathologic processes:
prostatitis, nodular hyperplasia and carcinoma. While benign
nodular hyperplasia occurs in the periurethral part distorting
and compressing the centrally located urethral lumen, the
prostatic carcinoma usually arises from the outer subcapsular
part in which case it does not compress the urethra
(Figs. 23.12, B, C).
PROSTATITIS
Inflammation of the prostate i.e. prostatitis, may be acute,
chronic and granulomatous types.
Acute Prostatitis
Acute focal or diffuse suppurative inflammation of the
prostate is not uncommon. It occurs most commonly due to
ascent of bacteria from the urethra, less often by descent from
the upper urinary tract or bladder, and occasionally by
lymphogenous or haematogenous spread from a distant
focus of infection. The infection may occur spontaneously
or may be a complication of urethral manipulation such as
by catheterisation, cystoscopy, urethral dilatation and
surgical procedures on the prostate. The common pathogens
are those which cause UTI, most frequently E. coli, and others
such as Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, gono-
cocci, staphylococci and streptococci. The diagnosis is made
by culture of urine specimen.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the prostate is
enlarged, swollen and tense. Cut section shows multiple
abscesses and foci of necrosis.
Histologically, the prostatic acini are dilated and filled
with neutrophilic exudate. There may be diffuse acute

717
CHAPTER 23
The Male Reproductive System and Prostate
inflammatory infiltrate. Oedema, hyperaemia and foci of
necrosis frequently accompany acute inflammatory
involvement.
Chronic Prostatitis
Chronic prostatitis is more common and foci of chronic
inflammation are frequently present in the prostate of men
above 40 years of age. Chronic prostatitis is usually
asymptomatic but may cause allergic reactions, iritis, neuritis
or arthritis.
Chronic prostatitis is of 2 types—bacterial and abacterial.
Chronic bacterial prostatitis is caused in much the same
way and by the same organisms as the acute prostatitis. It is
generally a consequence of recurrent UTI. Diagnosis is made
by detection of more than 10-12 leucocytes per high power
field in expressed prostatic secretions, and by positive culture
of urine specimen and prostatic secretions. This condition is
more difficult to treat since antibiotics penetrate the prostate
poorly.
Chronic abacterial prostatitis is more common. There is
no history of recurrent UTI and culture of urine and prostatic
secretions is always negative, though leucocytosis is
demonstrable in prostatic secretions. The pathogens
implicated are Chlamydia trachomatis and Ureaplasma
urealyticum.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Pathologic changes in
both bacterial and abacterial prostatitis are similar.
Grossly, the prostate may be enlarged, fibrosed and
shrunken.
Histologically, the diagnosis of chronic prostatitis is made
by foci of lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages and
neutrophils within the prostatic substance. Corpora
amylacea, prostatic calculi and foci of squamous
metaplasia in the prostatic acini may accompany
inflammatory changes. Seminal vesicles are invariably
involved.
Granulomatous Prostatitis
Granulomatous prostatitis is a variety of chronic prostatitis,
probably caused by leakage of prostatic secretions into the
tissue, or could be of autoimmune origin.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the gland is firm
to hard, giving the clinical impression of prostatic
carcinoma on rectal examination.
Histologically, the inflammatory reaction consists of
macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells and some
multinucleate giant cells. The condition may be confused
with tuberculous prostatitis.
NODULAR HYPERPLASIA
Non-neoplastic tumour-like enlargement of the prostate,
commonly termed benign nodular hyperplasia (BNH) or
benign enlargement of prostate (BEP), is a very common
condition in men and considered by some as normal ageing
process. It becomes increasingly more frequent above the age
of 50 years and its incidence approaches 75-80% in men above
80 years. However, symptomatic BEP producing urinary tract
obstruction and requiring surgical treatment occurs in 5-10%
of cases only.
ETIOLOGY. The cause of BEP has not been fully established.
However, a few etiologic factors such as endocrinologic, racial,
inflammation and arteriosclerosis have been implicated but
endocrine basis for hyperplasia has been more fully
investigated and considered a strong possibility in its genesis.
It has been found that both sexes elaborate androgen and
oestrogen, though the level of androgen is high in males and
that of oestrogen is high in females. With advancing age,
there is decline in the level of androgen and a corresponding
rise of oestrogen in the males. The periurethral inner prostate
which is primarily involved in BEP is responsive to the rising
level of oestrogen, whereas the outer prostate which is mainly
involved in the carcinoma is responsive to androgen. A
plausible hypothesis suggested is that there is synergistic
stimulation of the prostate by both hormones—the oestrogen
acting to sensitise the prostatic tissue to the growth
promoting effect of dihydroxy-testosterone derived from
plasma testosterone.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the enlarged pro-
state is nodular, smooth and firm and weighs 2-4 times
its normal weight i.e. may weigh up to 40-80 gm. The
appearance on cut section varies depending upon whether
the hyperplasia is predominantly of the glandular or
fibromuscular tissue (Fig. 23.13). In primarily glandular BEP
the tissue is yellow-pink, soft, honey-combed, and milky
fluid exudes, whereas in mainly fibromuscular BEP the cut
surface is firm, homogeneous and does not exude milky
fluid. The hyperplastic nodule forms a mass mainly in
the inner periurethral prostatic gland so that the
surrounding prostatic tissue forms a false capsule which
enables the surgeon to enucleate the nodular masses. The

718
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
left-over peripheral prostatic tissue may sometimes
undergo recurrent nodular enlargement or may develop
carcinoma later.
Histologically, in every case, there is hyperplasia of all
three tissue elements in varying proportions—glandular,
fibrous and muscular (Fig. 23.14):
Glandular hyperplasia predominates in most cases and
is identified by exaggerated intra-acinar papillary
infoldings with delicate fibrovascular cores. The lining
epithelium is two-layered: the inner tall columnar mucus-
secreting with poorly-defined borders, and the outer
cuboidal to flattened epithelium with basal nuclei.
Fibromuscular hyperplasia when present as dominant
component appears as aggregates of spindle cells forming
an appearance akin to fibromyoma of the uterus.
In addition to glandular and/or fibromuscular
hyperplasia, other histologic features frequently found
include foci of lymphocytic aggregates, small areas of
infarction, corpora amylacea and foci of squamous
metaplasia.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Clinically, the symptomatic cases
develop symptoms due to complications such as urethral
obstruction and secondary effects on the bladder (e.g.
hypertrophy, cystitis), ureter (e.g. hydroureter) and kidneys
(e.g. hydronephrosis). The presenting features include
frequency, nocturia, difficulty in micturition, pain,
haematuria and sometimes, the patients present with acute
retention of urine requiring immediate catheterisation.
CARCINOMA OF PROSTATE
Cancer of the prostate is the second most common form of
cancer in males, followed in frequency by lung cancer. It is a
disease of men above the age of 50 years and its prevalence
increases with increasing age so that more than 50% of men
80 years old have asymptomatic (latent) carcinoma of the
prostate. Many a times, carcinoma of the prostate is small
and detected as microscopic foci in a prostate removed for
BEP or found incidentally at autopsy. Thus, it is common to
classify carcinoma of the prostate into the following 4 types:
1.
Latent carcinoma. This is found unexpectedly as a small
focus of carcinoma in the prostate during autopsy studies in
men dying of other causes. Its incidence in autopsies has been
variously reported as 25-35%.
2.
Incidental carcinoma. About 15-20% of prostatectomies
done for BEP reveal incidental carcinoma of the prostate.
3.
Occult carcinoma. This is the type in which the patient
has no symptoms of prostatic carcinoma but shows evidence
of metastases on clinical examination and investigations.
4.
Clinical carcinoma. Clinical prostatic carcinoma is the
type detected by rectal examination and other investigations
and confirmed by pathologic examination of biopsy of the
prostate.
ETIOLOGY. The cause of prostatic cancer remains obscure.
However, a few factors have been suspected. These are as
under:
1.
Endocrinologic factors. Androgens are considered
essential for development and maintenance of prostatic
epithelium. But how androgens are responsible for causing
malignant transformation is not yet clear. However, the
etiologic role of androgens is supported by the following
indirect evidences:
i)
Orchiectomy causes arrest of metastatic prostatic cancer
disease (testis being the main source of testosterone).
ii) Administration of oestrogen causes regression of pros-
tatic carcinoma.
iii) Cancer of the prostate is extremely rare in eunuchs and
in patients with Klinefelter’s syndrome.
iv) Cancer of the prostate begins at the stage of life when
androgen levels are high. However, the cancer may remain
latent with decline in androgen level with advancing age.
2.
Racial and geographic influences. There are some racial
and geographic differences in the incidence of prostatic
Figure 23.14
Nodular hyperplasia of the prostate. There is hyperplasia of fibromuscular elements. There are areas of intra-acinar papillary
infoldings (convolutions) lined by two layers of epithelium with basal polarity of nuclei.

719
CHAPTER 23
The Male Reproductive System and Prostate
cancer. It is uncommon in Japanese and Chinese, while the
prevalence is high in Americans. African Americans have a
markedly higher incidence as compared to whites which may
be related to genetic variation in androgen receptor gene.
3.
Environmental influences. Some common environ-
mental factors and carcinogens have been identified with
high risk to development of prostatic cancer. These include
high dietary fat, and exposure to polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons. Flavonoids, antioxidants and selenium may
reduce the risk.
4.
Nodular hyperplasia. Though nodular prostatic
hyperplasia has been suggested by some as precursor for
development of prostatic cancer, it is considered unlikely.
Most prostatic cancers develop in the periphery of the gland
while BEP occurs in the periurethral part of the gland. Any
concomitant occurrence of the two diseases may be
considered as aging process. Approximately 15-20% of
nodular hyperplastic prostates harbour carcinoma.
5.
Heredity. The possibility of genetic basis of prostatic
cancer has been suggested by the observations of familial
clustering and 2-fold higher frequency in first-degree
relatives.  Prostatic cancer susceptibility gene has been
identified in familial cases.
HISTOGENESIS. Histogenesis of prostatic adenocarcinoma
has been documented as a mutistep process arising from
premalignant stage of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN).
PIN refers to multiple foci of cytologically atypical luminal
cells overlying diminished number of basal cells in prostatic
ducts and is a forerunner of invasive prostatic carcinoma.
Based on cytologic atypia, PIN may be low grade to high
grade. PIN of high-grade progresses to prostatic adeno-
carcinoma.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the prostate may
be enlarged, normal in size or smaller than normal. In 95%
of cases, prostatic carcinoma is located in the peripheral
zone, especially in the posterior lobe. The malignant
prostate is firm and fibrous. Cut section is homogeneous
and contains irregular yellowish areas.
Microscopically, 4 histologic types are described—
adenocarcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, squamous
cell carcinoma and undifferentiated carcinoma. However,
adenocarcinoma is the most common type found in 96% of
cases and is the one generally referred to as carcinoma of
the prostate. The other three histologic types are rare and
resemble in morphology with similar malignant tumours
elsewhere in the body.
The histologic characteristics of adenocarcinoma of the
prostate are as under (Fig. 23.15):
1.
Architectural disturbance. In contrast to convoluted
appearance of the glands seen in normal and hyperplastic
prostate, there is loss of intra-acinar papillary
convolutions. The groups of acini are either closely packed
in back-to-back arrangement without intervening stroma
or are haphazardly distributed.
2.
Stroma. Normally, fibromuscular sling surrounds the
acini, whereas malignant acini have little or no stroma
between them. The tumour cells may penetrate and
replace the fibromuscular stroma.
3.
Gland pattern. Most frequently, the glands in well-
differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma are small or
medium-sized, lined by a single layer of cuboidal or low
columnar cells. Moderately-differentiated tumours have
cribriform or fenestrated glandular appearance. Poorly-
differentiated tumours have little or no glandular arrange-
ment but instead show solid or trabecular pattern.
4.
Tumour cells. In many cases, the individual tumour
cells in prostatic carcinoma do not show usual
morphologic features of malignancy. The tumour cells
may be clear, dark and eosinophilic cells. Clear cells have
foamy cytoplasm, dark cells have homogeneous basophilic
cytoplasm, and eosinophilic cells have granular cytoplasm.
The cells may show varying degree of anaplasia and
nuclear atypia but is generally slight.

Carcinoma of the prostate. The field shows microacini of small malignant cells infiltrating the prostatic stroma. Inset in the
photomicrograph shows perineural invasion by prostatic adenocarcinoma.

720
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
5.
Invasion. One of the important diagnostic features of
malignancy in prostate is the early and frequent
occurrence of invasion of intra-prostatic perineural spaces.
Lymphatic and vascular invasion may be present but are
difficult to detect.
SPREAD. The tumour spreads within the gland by direct
extension, and to distant sites by metastases.
Direct spread. Direct extension of the tumour occurs into
the prostatic capsule and beyond. In late stage, the tumour
may extend into the bladder neck, seminal vesicles, trigone
and ureteral openings.
Metastases. Distant spread occurs by both lymphatic and
haematogenous routes. The rich lymphatic network
surrounding the prostate is the main mode of spread to the
sacral, iliac and para-aortic lymph nodes. The earliest
metastasis occur to the obturator lymph node. Haemato-
genous spread leads most often to characteristic osteoblastic
osseous metastases, especially to pelvis, and lumbar spine;
other sites of metastases are lungs, kidneys, breast and brain.
The route of blood-borne metastases may be retrograde
spread by prostatic venous plexus or via systemic circulation.
CLINICAL FEATURES. By the time symptoms appear, the
carcinoma of prostate is usually palpable on rectal
examination as a hard and nodular gland fixed to the
surrounding tissues. In such symptomatic cases, clinical
features are: urinary obstruction with dysuria, frequency,
retention of urine, haematuria, and in 10% of cases pain in
the back due to skeletal metastases.
Clinical staging of carcinoma prostate takes into account
the following:
The tumour found incidentally or a clinically unsuspected
cancer in prostate removed for benign disorder (Stage A).
The tumour palpable by rectal digital examination but
confined to the prostate (Stage B).
The tumour has extended locally beyond the prostate into
the surrounding tissues (Stage C).
The tumour is associated with distant metastases
(Stage D).
Clinical staging has good correlation with histologic
grading and, thus, has a prognostic significance. Mostofi’s
(WHO) histologic grading categorising prostate cancer into
grade I (well-differentiated), grade II (moderately
differentiated) and grade III (poorly differentiated) has
largely been replaced with Gleason’s microscopic grading
system which is based on two features:
i)
Degree of glandular differentiation.
ii) Growth pattern of the tumour in relation to the stroma.
These features are assessed by low-power examination
of the prostatic tissue.  For clinical staging of prostate cancer,
TNM system is considered international standard.
The diagnosis of prostatic carcinoma is made by
cytologic, biochemical, radiologic, ultrasonographic and
pathologic methods. However, definite diagnosis is
established by histopathologic examination of transrectal
ultrasound (TRUS)- guided core needle biopsy.
Two serum tumour markers employed commonly for
diagnosis and monitoring the prognosis of prostatic
carcinoma are as under:
Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) is secreted by prostatic
epithelium. Elevation of serum level of PAP is found in cases
of prostatic cancer which have extended beyond the capsule
or have metastasised. PAP can also be demonstrated in the
normal prostatic tissues.
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) can be detected by
immunohistochemical method in the malignant prostatic
epithelium as well as estimated in the serum. A reading
between 4 and 10 (normal 0-4 ng/ml) is highly suspicious
(10% risk) but value above 10 is diagnostic of prostatic carci-
noma. PSA assay is useful in deciding whether the metastasis
originated from the prostate or not. PSA assay is also helpful
in distinguishing high-grade prostatic cancer from urothelial
carcinoma, colonic carcinoma, lymphoma and prostatitis.
PSA level is generally higher in low-grade tumours than in
high-grade tumours.
Treatment of prostatic carcinoma consists of surgery,
radiotherapy and hormonal therapy. The hormonal depen-
dence of prostate cancer consists of depriving the tumour
cells of growth-promoting influence of testosterone. This can
be achieved by bilateral orchiectomy followed by
administration of oestrogen. Surgical approaches for prostate
cancer include transurethral resection (TUR), radical
prostatectomy and transurethral US-guided laser-induced
prostatectomy (TULIP).

VULVA
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The vulva consists of structures of ectodermal origin—labia
majora, labia minora, mons pubis, clitoris, vestibule, hymen,
Bartholin’s glands and minor vestibular glands. The mons
pubis and labia majora are covered externally by skin with
hair follicles, sebaceous glands and sweat glands including
apocrine glands. The inner surface of labia majora, labia
minora and vestibule are covered by stratified squamous
epithelium. The clitoris is made up of vascular erectile tissue.
Bartholin’s or vulvovaginal glands are located one on each
side of the mass of tissue forming labia majora. The glands
are racemose type and their secretions are released during
sexual excitement.
Since vulva is of ectodermal origin, the common inflam-
matory conditions affecting it are similar to those found on
the skin generally. A few specific conditions such as
Bartholin’s cyst and abscess, vulvar dystrophy and certain
tumours are described below.
BARTHOLIN’S CYST AND ABSCESS
Inflammation of Bartholin’s vulvovaginal glands (Bartholin’s
adenitis) may occur due to bacterial infection, notably
gonorrhoeal infection. Infection may be acute or chronic.
Acute Bartholin’s adenitis occurs from obstruction and
dilatation of the duct by infection resulting in formation of a
Bartholin’s abscess. The condition presents with intense pain,
swelling and fluctuant mass which can be incised and
drained.
Microscopic examination shows the usual appearance of
acute suppurative inflammation with neutrophilic infil-
tration, hyperaemia, oedema and epithelial degeneration.
Chronic Bartholin’s adenitis results from a less virulent
infection so that the process is slow and prolonged. Alter-
natively, the chronic process evolves from repeated attacks
of less severe acute inflammation which may be short of
abscess formation and resolves incompletely. In either case,
the chronic inflammatory process terminates into fluid-filled
Bartholin’s cyst. The resulting cyst may be quite large,
3-5 cm in diameter and readily palpable in the perineum,
but may remain asymptomatic for years.
Histologic examination shows variable lining of the cyst
varying from the transitional epithelium of the normal
duct to a flattened lining because of increased intracystic
pressure. The cyst wall may show chronic inflammatory
infiltrate and a few mucus-secreting acini.
NON-NEOPLASTIC EPITHELIAL DISORDERS
The older nomenclature vulvar dystrophy has been replaced
by more descriptive and clinically relevant term, non-
neoplastic epithelial disorders of vulval skin and mucosa of
vulva. The term is applied to chronic lesions of the vulva
characterised clinically by white, plaque-like, pruritic
mucosal thickenings and pathologically by disorders of
epithelial growth. Clinicians often use the term ‘leukoplakia’
for such white lesions. But white lesions may represent other
depigmented conditions as well such as vitiligo, inflam-
matory dermatoses, carcinoma in situ, Paget’s disease, or
even invasive carcinoma, and thus use of the term
leukoplakia by pathologists is not recommneded.
Currently, non-neoplastic epithelial disorders of the skin
of vulva includes following 2 lesions:
1.
Lichen sclerosus (older term: atrophic dystrophy).
2.
Squamous hyperplasia (older term: hyperplastic
dystrophy).
The two types of lesions may coexist in the same patient.
Lichen Sclerosus
Lichen sclerosus may occur anywhere in the skin (Chapter
26) but is more common and more extensive in the vulva in
post-menopausal women. The lesions appear as multiple,
small, coalescent, yellowish-blue macules or papules which
produce thin and shiny parchment-like skin. The lesions may
extend from vulva onto the perianal and perineal area.
Clinically, the patient, usually a post-menopausal woman,
complains of intense pruritus which may produce excoriation
of the affected skin. Eventually, there is progressive shrinkage
and atrophy resulting in narrowing of the introitus, clinically
referred to as kraurosis vulvae.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Microscopically, the
following characteristics are seen (Fig. 24.1,A):
1.
Hyperkeratosis of the surface layer.
2.
Thinning of the epidermis with disappearance of rete
ridges.
3.
Amorphous homogeneous degenerative change in the
dermal collagen.

Chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the mid-dermis.
Lichen sclerosus is not a premalignant lesion and responds
favourably to topical treatment with androgens.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Squamous Hyperplasia
Squamous hyperplasia is characterised by white, thickened
vulvar lesions which are usually itchy. The cause is unknown
but symptomatic relief results from use of topical treatment
with corticosteroids.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The histologic charac-
teristics are as under (Fig. 24.1,B):
1.
Hyperkeratosis.
2.
Hyperplasia of squamous epithelium with elongation
of rete ridges.
3.
Increased mitotic activity of squamous layers but
cytologically no atypia.
4.
Chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the underlying
dermis.
A small proportion of cases of hyperplastic dystrophy
(1-4%) may show cytologic atypia and produce vulvar dys-
plasia which may progress to vulvar carcinoma in situ and
invasive carcinoma.
VULVAL TUMOURS
Vulva is the site of a variety of benign and malignant neo-
plasms which are in common with skin neoplasms elsewhere
in the body. These include papillomas, fibromas, neuro-
fibromas, angiomas, lipomas, sweat gland tumours,
squamous cell carcinoma, verrucous carcinoma, malignant
melanoma and mesenchymal sarcomas. However, a few
tumours peculiar to the vulva such as stromal polyps,
papillary hidradenoma, condyloma acuminatum, extra-
mammary Paget’s disease, vulval carcinoma and intra-
epithelial neoplasia are discussed below.
Stromal Polyps
Stromal (fibroepithelial) polyps or acrochordons may form
in the vulva or vagina. There may be single or multiple
polypoid masses.
Histologically, they are covered by an orderly stratified
squamous epithelium. The stroma consists of loose fibrous
and myxomatous connective tissue with some adipose
tissue and blood vessels.
Papillary Hidradenoma (Hidradenoma Papilliferum)
This is a benign tumour arising from apocrine sweat glands
of the vulva. Most commonly, it is located in the labia or in
the perianal region as a small sharply circumscribed nodule.
Histologically, the tumour lies in the dermis under a
normal epidermis. The tumour consists of papillary
structures composed of fibrovascular stalk and is covered
by double layer of epithelial cells—a layer of flattened
myoepithelial cells and an overlying layer of columnar
cells.
Condyloma Acuminatum
Condyloma acuminata or anogenital warts are benign
papillary lesions of squamous epithelium which can be
transmitted venereally to male sex partner. They may be
solitary but more frequently are multiple forming soft warty
masses. The common locations are the anus, perineum,
vaginal wall, vulva and vagina. They are induced by human
papilloma virus (HPV), particularly types 6 and 11.
Histologically, they are identical to their counterparts on
male external genitalia (Chapter 23). The features consist
of a tree-like proliferation of stratified squamous
epithelium, showing marked acanthosis, hyperkeratosis,
parakeratosis, papillomatosis and perinuclear
vacuolisation of epithelium called koilocytosis, indicative
of HPV infection. The papillary projections consist of fibro-
vascular stoma.
Condylomas are benign lesions and regress sponta-
neously except in immunosuppressed individuals.
Extra-Mammary Paget’s Disease
Paget’s disease of the vulva is a rare condition which has
skin manifestations like those of Paget’s disease of the nipple
(Chapter 25). The affected skin, most often on the labia
majora, appears as map-like, red, scaly, elevated and
indurated area.
Histologically, extra-mammary Paget’s disease is
identified by the presence of large, pale, carcinoma cells
lying singly or in small clusters within the epidermis and
adnexal structures. These cells characteristically have halo
which stains positively with PAS, alcian blue and
mucicarmine and are thus believed to be of apocrine
epithelial origin.
Unlike Paget’s disease of the breast in which case there
is always an underlying ductal carcinoma, extra-mammary
Paget’s disease is confined to the epidermis in most cases
and only a small proportion of cases have an underlying
adenocarcinoma. Prognosis is good if there is no invasion
but occasional cases progress into invasive carcinoma.

CHAPTER 24
The Female Genital Tract
Vulval Intraepithelial Neoplasia and
Invasive Carcinoma
Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and invasive
squamous cell carcinoma are morphologically similar to
those in the cervix and vagina. The etiologic role of certain
viruses in carcinogenesis, particularly high-risk HPV types
16 and 18, in these sites is well documented. Mention has
already been made about the preceding stage of vulval
epithelial disorders, particularly squamous hyperplasia, in
the development of these lesions. Vulval carcinoma
constitutes 3% of all female genital tract cancers. The usual
age for development of cancer or VIN is the 4th to 6th decade.
Grossly, VIN and vulval carcinoma in early stage is a
‘white’ lesion (leukoplakia) while later the area develops
an exophytic or endophytic (ulcerative) growth pattern.
The traditional VIN lesion, described as Bowen’s disease
of the vulva, is generally a slightly elevated velvety plaque
lesion.
Microscopically, these lesions are squamous cell type with
varying anaplasia and depth of invasion depending upon
the stage (Fig. 24.2). HPV-positive tumours are more often
poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma while
HPV-negative are well-differentiated keratinising type.
Verrucous carcinoma is a rare variant which is a fungating
tumour but is locally malignant.
Clinical staging for vulval carcinoma based on tumour size
(< or > 2 cm) and extent of spread has been described by
International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics
(FIGO staging, Table 24.1).
VAGINA
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The vagina consists of a collapsed cylinder extending
between vestibule externally and the cervix internally.
Histologically, the vaginal wall consists of 3 layers: an outer
fibrous, a middle muscular and an inner epithelial. The
muscular coat has a double layer of smooth muscle. The
epithelial layer consists of stratified squamous epithelium
which undergoes cytologic changes under hormonal stimuli.
Oestrogen increases its thickness such as during reproductive
years, whereas the epithelium is thin in childhood, and
atrophic after menopause when oestrogen stimulation is
minimal.
Primary diseases of the vagina are uncommon. The only
important clinicopathologic conditions which require to be
described here are vaginitis and certain tumours.
VAGINITIS AND VULVOVAGINITIS
Since vulva and vagina are anatomically close to each other,
often inflammation of one affects the other location. Certain
other infections are quite common in the vulva and vagina
as follows:
Bacterial e.g. streptococci, staphylococci, Escherichia coli,
Haemophilus vaginalis.
Fungal e.g. Candida albicans.
Protozoal e.g. Trichomonas vaginalis.
Viral e.g. Herpes simplex.
The most common causes of vaginitis are Candida
(moniliasis) and Trichomonas (trichomoniasis). The hyphae
of Candida can be seen in the vaginal smears. Similarly, the
protozoa, Trichomonas, can be identified in smears (Chapter
11). These infections are particularly common in pregnant
and diabetic women and may involve both vulva and vagina.
However, the adult vaginal mucosa is relatively resistant to
gonococcal infection because of its histology.
TUMOURS AND TUMOUR-LIKE CONDITIONS
Vaginal cysts such as Gartner’s duct (Wolffian) cyst lined by
glandular epithelium and vaginal inclusion cyst arising from
inclusion of vaginal epithelium are more common benign
vaginal tumours and tumour-like conditions. Other
uncommon benign tumours are papillomas, fibromas,
lipomas, angiomas and leiomyomas and resemble their
counterparts elsewhere in the body. Primary malignancies

of the epithelium. Photomicrograph on right under higher magnification
shows mitotic figures in the layers of squamous epithelium.

Systemic Pathology
of the vagina are rare and include carcinoma (squamous cell
carcinoma and adenocarcinoma) and embryonal
rhabdomyosarcoma (sarcoma botyroides).
Carcinoma of Vagina
Primary carcinoma of the vagina is an uncommon tumour.
Squamous cell dysplasia or vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia
occur less frequently as compared to the cervix or vulva and
can be detected by Pap smears as discussed in Chapter 11.
Invasive carcinoma of the vagina includes two main types:
1.
Squamous cell carcinoma of vagina constitutes less than
2% of all gynaecologic malignancies and is similar in
morphology as elsewhere in the female genital tract. The role
of HPV types 16 and 18 in its etiology and the possibility of
an extension from cervical carcinoma to the vagina have been
emphasised.
2.
Adenocarcinoma of the vagina is much less than
squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina. It may be endo-
metrioid or mucinous type. The significance of association
of diethylstilbestrol administered during pregnancy to the
mother with development of adenocarcinoma of the vagina
in the daughter has been discussed in Chapter 8.
Clinical staging of carcinoma of vagina proposed by FIGO
is given in Table 24.2.
Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma
(Sarcoma Botyroides)
This is an unusual and rare malignant tumour occurring in
infants and children under 5 years of age. The common
location is anterior vaginal wall. Similar tumours may occur
in the urinary bladder (Chapter 22), head and neck region
(Chapter 18) (orbit, nasopharynx, middle ear, oral cavity) and
biliary tract.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
characterised by bulky and polypoid grape-like mass
(botyroides = grape) that fills and projects out of the vagina.
Histologically, the features are as under:
1.
Groups of round to fusiform tumour cells are
characteristically lying underneath the vaginal epithelium,
called cambium layer of tumour cells.
2.
The central core of polypoid masses is composed of
loose and myxoid stroma with many inflammatory cells.
The tumour invades extensively in the pelvis and
metastasises to regional lymph nodes and distant sites such
as to lungs and liver. Radical surgery combined with
chemotherapy offers some benefit.
CERVIX
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The cervix consists of an internal os communicating with the
endometrial cavity above, and an external os opening into
the vagina below. Ectocervix (exocervix) or portio vaginalis is
the part of the cervix exposed to the vagina and is lined by
stratified squamous epithelium, whereas the endocervix is
continuous with the endocervical canal and is lined by a
single layer of tall columnar mucus-secreting epithelium. The
endocervical mucosa is thrown into folds resulting in
formation of clefts and tunnels, commonly referred to as
cervical glands that secrete mucus. The junction of the
ectocervix and endocervix—junctional mucosa, consists of
gradual transition between squamous and columnar
epithelia (squamo-columnar junction) and is clinically and
pathologically significant landmark. The cervical mucosa
undergoes changes under the influence of hormones and
during pregnancy. The cervical mucus varies during the men-
strual cycle, being viscus after menses, but under the
influence of oestrogen becomes thin which on drying forms
fern-like pattern on glass slide.
Lesions of the cervix are rather common. Of great signifi-
cance are cervicitis, certain benign tumours, dysplasia,
carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma.
CERVICITIS
Some degree of cervical inflammation is present in virtually
all multiparous women and some nulliparous women. The
normal intact ectocervical stratified epithelium is usually
more resistant to infection whereas the endocervical
columnar epithelium bears the brunt of the initial
inflammation.
Cervicitis may be specific or nonspecific, acute or chronic.
Specific cervicitis may be caused by tuberculosis, syphilis,
granuloma inguinale, lymphogranuloma venereum,
chlamydia and chancroid. Nonspecific cervicitis is more
frequent and is generally divided into acute and chronic
forms, the latter being quite common.
ACUTE CERVICITIS. Acute cervicitis is usually associated
with puerperium or gonococcal infection. Other causes are
primary chancre and infection with herpes simplex.
Grossly, the cervix shows everted endocervical mucosa
which is red and oedematous.
Histologically, there is infiltration of the subepithelial and
periglandular tissue with neutrophils, and there is oedema
and congestion. The mucosa may be ulcerated and
haemorrhagic.
CHRONIC CERVICITIS. Chronic nonspecific cervicitis is
encountered quite frequently and is the common cause of
leukorrhoea. The most common organisms responsible for

The Female Genital Tract
chronic cervicitis are the normal mixed vaginal flora that
includes streptococci, enterococci (e.g. E. coli) and
staphylococci. Other infecting organisms include gonococci,
Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida albicans and herpes simplex.
Factors predisposing to chronic cervicitis are sexual
intercourse, trauma of childbirth, instrumentation and excess
or deficiency of oestrogen.
Grossly, there is eversion of ectocervix with hyperaemia,
oedema and granular surface. Nabothian (retention) cysts
may be grossly visible from the surface as pearly grey
vesicles.
Histologically, chronic cervicitis is characterised by
extensive subepithelial inflammatory infiltrate of
lymphocytes, plasma cells, large mononuclear cells and a
few neutrophils. There may be formation of lymphoid
follicles termed follicular cervicitis. The surface epithelium
may be normal, or may show squamous metaplasia. The
squamous epithelium of the ectocervix in cases of uterine
prolapse may develop surface keratinisation and
hyperkeratosis, so called epidermidisation. Areas of
squamous metaplasia and hyperkeratosis may be
mistaken on cursory microscopic look for a well-
differentiated squamous carcinoma.
TUMOURS
Both benign and malignant tumours are common in the
cervix. In addition, cervix is the site of ‘shades of grey’ lesions
that include cervical dysplasia and carcinoma in situ (cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia, CIN), currently termed squamous
intraepithelial lesions (SIL). Benign tumours of the cervix
consist most commonly of cervical polyps. Uncommon
benign cervical tumours are leiomyomas, papillomas and
condyloma acuminatum which resemble in morphology with
similar tumours elsewhere in the genital tract. The most
common malignant tumour is squamous carcinoma of the
cervix.
Cervical Polyps
Cervical polyps are localised benign proliferations of
endocervical mucosa though they may protrude through the
external os. They are found in 2-5% of adult women and
produce irregular vaginal spotting.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, cervical polyp is
a small (up to 5 cm in size), bright red, fragile growth
which is frequently pedunculated but may be sessile.
Microscopically, most cervical polyps are endocervical
polyps and are covered with endocervical epithelium
which may show squamous metaplasia. Less frequently,
the covering is by squamous epithelium of the portio
vaginalis. The stroma of the polyp is composed of loose
and oedematous fibrous tissue with variable degree of
inflammatory infiltrate and contains dilated mucus-
secreting endocervical glands (Fig. 24.3).
Microglandular Hyperplasia
Microglandular hyperplasia is a benign condition of the
cervix in which there is closely packed proliferation of
endocervical glands without intervening stroma. The
condition is caused by progestrin stimulation such as during
pregnancy, postpartum period and in women taking oral
contraceptives. Morphologically, condition may be mistaken
for well-differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (SIL)
(Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia, CIN)
TERMINOLOGY. Presently, the terms dysplasia, CIN,
carcinoma in situ, and SIL are used synonymously as follows:
DYSPLASIA. The term ‘dysplasia’ (meaning ‘bad moul-
ding’) has been commonly used for atypical cytologic
changes in the layers of squamous epithelium, the changes
being progressive (Chapter 3). Depending upon the thickness
of squamous epithelium involved by atypical cells, dysplasia
is conventionally graded as mild, moderate and severe. Carci-
noma in situ is the full-thickness involvement by atypical
cells, or in other words carcinoma confined to layers above
the basement membrane. At times, severe dysplasia may not
be clearly demarcated from carcinoma in situ. It is well
accepted that invasive cervical cancer evolves through
progressive stages of dysplasia and carcinoma in situ.
CIN. An alternative classification is to group various grades
of dysplasia and carcinoma in situ together into cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) which is similarly graded
from grade I to III. According to this concept, the criteria are
as under:
CIN-1 represents less than one-third involvement of the
thickness of epithelium (mild dysplasia).
CIN-2 is one-third to two-third involvement (moderate
dysplasia).
CIN-3 is full-thickness involvement or equivalent to
carcinoma in situ (severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ).
Figure 24.3

endocervical mucosa with squamous metaplasia. The stromal core is
composed of dense fibrous tissue which shows nonspecific inflammation.

726
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
SIL. Currently, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the
US has proposed the Bethesda System (TBS) for reporting
cervical and vaginal cytopathology. According to the
Bethesda system, based on cytomorphologic features and
HPV types implicated in their etiology, the three grades of
CIN are readjusted into two grades of squamous
intraepithelial lesions (SIL)— low-grade SIL (L-SIL) and high-
grade SIL (H-SIL) as under:
L-SIL corresponds to CIN-1 and is a flat condyloma,
having koilocytic atypia, usually related to HPV 6 and 11
infection (i.e. includes mild dysplasia and HPV infection).
H-SIL corresponds to CIN-2 and 3 and has abnormal
pleomorphic atypical squamous cells. HPV 16 and 18 are
implicated in the etiology of H-SIL (i.e. includes moderate
dysplasia, severe dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ).
A comparison of these classifications is shown in
Table 24.3.
Progressive grades of dysplsia/CIN/SIL is a classical
example of progression of malignancy through stepwise
epithelial changes and that it can be detected early by simple
Papanicolaou cytologic test (‘Pap smear’) (Chapter 11). The
use of Pap smear followed by colposcopy and biopsy
confirms the diagnosis which has helped greatly in instituting
early effective therapy and thus has reduced the incidence
of cervical cancer in the West.
CIN or SIL can develop at any age though it is rare before
puberty. Low-grade reversible changes arise in young
women between 25 and 30 years old, whereas progressive
higher grades of epithelial changes develop a decade later.
Hence, the desirability of periodic Pap smears on all women
after they become sexually active.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The biology of CIN/SIL and its
relationship to invasive carcinoma of the cervix is well
understood by epidemiologic, virologic, molecular,
immunologic and ultrastructural studies (Fig. 24.4):
1.
Epidemiologic studies. Based on epidemiology of large
population of women with cervical cancer, several risk factors
have been identified which include the following 4 most
important factors:
i)
Women having early age of sexual activity.
ii) Women having multiple sexual partners.
iii) Women with persistent HPV infection with high-risk types
of oncogenic virus.
iv) Potential role of high risk male sexual partner such as
promiscuous male having previous multiple sexual partners,
having history of penile condyloma, or male who had
previous spouse with cervical cancer.
In addition to the above factors, other epidemiologic
observations reveal high incidence of cervical cancer in lower
socioeconomic strata, in multiparous women, promiscuous
women, cigarette smoking women, users of oral
contraceptives, HIV infection and immunosuppression,
while a low incidence is noted in virgins and nuns.
2.
Virologic studies. Human papilloma virus (HPV)
infection is strongly implicated in the etiology of cervical
cancer. By recombinant DNA hybridisation techniques,
following observations have been documented:
High-risk type HPV, most commonly of types 16 and 18
(in 70% cases), and less often types 31, 33, 52 and 58, are
present in 70-100% cases of cervical cancer.
Low-risk type HPV types 6 and 11 are found most
frequently in condylomas.
Mixed high and low risk types of HPV may be found in
dysplasias.
Besides HPV, a few other viruses may adversely affect
the prognosis but do not have etiologic relationship are HIV,
HTLV-1 and EBV infection.

The Female Genital Tract
3.
Molecular studies. Immunohistochemical, cytogenetic
and molecular studies have shown that low-risk HPV types
do not integrate in the host cell genome, while high-risk HPV
types are integrated into the nucleus of cervical epithelial
cells. Upon integration, protein product of HPV-16 and 18,
E7 and E6 proteins respectively, inactivate tumour suppres-
sor genes, p53 and RB-1 gene, thus permitting uncontrolled
cellular proliferation. It has been possible to document that
morphologic abnormalities in cervical lesions have good
correlation with underlying cellular events by use of
techniques such as proliferation cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA), p16, p53 and p63 expression, and nucleolar organizer
region (AgNOR). However, all women who harbour HPV
infection with high-risk type do not develop invasive cancer
of the cervix. Women who have persistence of this infection
or those who have another cofactor such as cigarette smoking
or immunodeficiency, are at greater risk to develop
progression of lesions.
4.
Immunologic studies. Circulating tumour specific anti-
gens and antibodies are detected in patients of cervical cancer.
Antibodies to virus specific antigens are identified on tumour
cells and in sera of such patients.

changes (lower part of figure). The grades of CIN-1 or mild dysplasia (L-SIL), CIN-2 (moderate dysplasia) and CIN-3 (severe dysplasia and
carcinoma in situ) (together grouped as H-SIL) show progressive increase in the number of abnormal cells parallel to the increasing severity of
grades. B, Exfoliative cytologic studies in various grades of cellular changes (upper part of figure).
5.
Ultrastructural studies. The changes observed on ultra-
structural studies of cells in CIN/SIL reveal increased mito-
chondria and free ribosomes, and depletion of normally
accumulated glycogen in the surface cells. The latter change
forms the basis of Schiller’s test in which the suspected cervix
is painted with solution of iodine and potassium iodide. The
cancerous focus, if present, fails to stain because of lack of
glycogen in the surface cells.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, no specific
picture is associated with cellular atypia found in
dysplasias or carcinoma in situ except that the changes
begin at the squamocolumnar junction or transitional
zone. The diagnosis can be suspected clinically on the basis
of Schiller’s test done on bedside.
Histologically, distinction between various grades of CIN
is quite subjective, but, in general dysplastic cells are
distributed in the layers of squamous epithelium for
varying thickness, and accordingly graded as mild,
moderate and severe dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ
(Fig. 24.5,A).

728
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
In mild dysplasia (CIN-1), the abnormal cells extend up
to one-third thickness from the basal to the surface layer;
In moderate dysplasia (CIN-2) up to two-thirds;
In severe dysplasia (CIN-3), these cells extend from 75-
90% thickness of epithelium; and
In carcinoma in situ (included in CIN-3), the entire
thickness from the basement membrane to the surface
shows dysplastic cells.
 The atypical cells migrate to the surface layers from
where they are shed off (exfoliated) into vaginal secre-
tions in Pap smear. The individual dysplastic or abnor-
mal cells in these grades of atypia show various cytologic
changes such as: crowding of cells, pleomorphism, high
nucleocytoplasmic ratio, coarse and irregular nuclear
chromatin, numerous mitoses and scattered dyskaryotic
cells.
 The diagnosis of dysplasia and carcinoma in situ or CIN/
SIL is best made by exfoliative cytologic studies discussed in
Chapter 11. The degree of atypicality in the exfoliated surface
epithelial cells can be objectively graded on the basis of 3
principal features (Fig. 24.5,B):
1.
More severe nuclear dyskaryotic changes such as
increased hyperchromasia and nuclear membrane folding.
2.
Decreased cytoplasmic maturation i.e. less cytoplasm as
the surface cells show less maturation.
3.
In lower grades of dysplasia (CIN-1/L-SIL) predomi-
nantly superficial and intermediate cells are shed off whereas
in severe dysplasia and in carcinoma in situ (CIN-3/H-SIL)
the desquamated cells are mainly small, dark basal cells. The
lesions of SIL in cytology have histologic correlation with
colposcopy-directed cervical biopsy in 70-90% cases
(Fig. 24.6).
CERVICAL SCREENING AND THE BETHESDA
SYSTEM. With introduction of effective Pap screening
programme in the Western countries, incidence of invasive
cervical cancer has declined greatly. However, still
worldwide cervical cancer remains third most common
cancer in women, next to breast and lung cancer. Although
accurate statistics are not available from India, but it is
perhaps the leading cause of death in women. In the Pap
screening programme, patients having abnormal Pap smear
are appropriately followed up and, therefore, it requires
understanding of the Bethesda system by the clinician as
regards value and limitations of cytology reports prepared
by the cytologist/cytotechnician.
Cervical screening recommendations include annual
cervical smear in all sexually active women having any risk
factors listed above. However, if three consecutive Pap
smears are negative in ‘high-risk women’ or satisfactory in
‘low risk women’, frequency of Pap screening is reduced.
There is no upper age limit for cervical screening.
The broad principles of the Bethesda system of cytologic
evaluation are as under:
Pap smears are evaluated as regards adequacy of specimen
i.e. satisfactory for evaluation, satisfactory but limited, or
unsatisfactory for evaluation giving reason.
General diagnosis is given in the form of normal or
abnormal smear.
Descriptive diagnosis is given in abnormal smears that
includes: benign cellular changes, reactive cellular changes,
and abnormalities of epithelial cells.
Cellular abnormalities include: ASCUS (atypical
squamous cells of undetermined significance), L-SIL
(mentioning HPV infection and CIN-1 present or not), H-SIL
(stating CIN-2 or CIN-3) and squamous cell carcinoma.
Invasive Cervical Cancer
Invasive cervical cancer in about 80% of cases is epidermoid
(squamous cell) carcinoma. The incidence of invasive
carcinoma of the cervix has shown a declining trend in
developed countries in the last half of the century due to
increased use of Pap smear technique for early detection and
diagnosis but the incidence remains high in developing

countries with low living standards. The risk factors and
etiologic factors are the same as for CIN discussed above.
The peak incidence of invasive cervical cancer is in 4th to
6th decades of life.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, invasive cervical
carcinoma may present 3 types of patterns: fungating,
ulcerating and infiltrating. The fungating or exophytic
pattern appearing as cauliflower-like growth infiltrating
the adjacent vaginal wall is the most common type
(Fig. 24.7). Characteristically, cervical carcinoma arises
from the squamocolumnar junction. The advanced stage
of the disease is characterised by widespread destruction
and infiltration into adjacent structures including the
urinary bladder, rectum, vagina and regional lymph
nodes. Distant metastases occur in the lungs, liver, bone
marrow and kidneys.
Histologically, the following patterns are seen:
1.
Epidermoid (Squamous cell) carcinoma. This type
comprises vast majority of invasive cervical carcinomas
(about 70%).
The most common pattern (70%) is moderately-
differentiated non-keratinising large cell type and has
better prognosis (Fig. 24.8).
Next in frequency (25%) is well-differentiated kerati-
nising epidermoid carcinoma.
Small cell undifferentiated carcinoma (neuroendocrine
or oat cell carcinoma) is less common (5%) and has a poor
prognosis.

Adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinomas comprise about
20-25% of cases. These may be well-differentiated mucus-
secreting adenocarcinoma, or clear cell type containing
glycogen but no mucin.
3.
Others. The remaining 5% cases are a variety of other
patterns such as adenosquamous carcinoma, verrucous
carcinoma and undifferentiated carcinoma.
CLINICAL STAGING. Classification of cervical cancer
described by the Cancer Committee of the International
Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO
classification) is widely adopted by the clinicians and
pathologists and is given in Table 24.4.
MYOMETRIUM AND ENDOMETRIUM
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The myometrium is the thick muscular wall of the uterus
which is covered internally by uterine mucosa called the
endometrium. The endometrium extends above the level of
the internal os where it joins the endocervical epithelium.
The myometrium is capable of marked alterations in its size,
capacity and contractility during pregnancy and labour. The
endometrium responds in a cyclic fashion to the ovarian
hormones with resultant monthly menstruation and has
remarkable regenerative capacity.
The lesions pertaining to the corpus uteri and the
endometrium are numerous and constitute vast majority of
gynaecologic conditions. However, some of the important
pathologic entities are discussed below, but first, the cyclic
changes in normal menstrual cycle are briefly reviewed.
NORMAL CYCLIC CHANGES
The normal endometrial cycle begins with proliferative phase
lasting for about 14 days under the influence of oestrogen,
followed by ovulation on or around 14th day, and consequent
secretory phase under the influence of progesterone. The
cycle ends with endometrial shedding and the next cycle
begins anew.
The histologic changes in different phases of the
menstrual cycle vary.
Histologically, the endometrium has different appearance
in different phases of the menstrual cycle. Essentially, the
endometrium consists of 3 structures: the endometrial
lining epithelium, endometrial glands and stroma.
Epithelial lining undergoes increase in its thickness
from cuboidal to tall columnar appearance at ovulation
and subsequently regresses.
Endometrial glands with their lining provide most of
the information on phase of the menstrual cycle. In the
immediate postmenstrual period, the glands are straight
and tubular, having columnar lining with basal nuclei.
This phase is under the predominant influence of
oestrogen and lasts for about 14 days and is called
proliferative phase. The evidence of ovulation is taken from
the appearance of convolutions in the glands and sub-
nuclear vacuolation in the cells indicative of secretions.
The secretory changes remain prominent for the next 7
days after ovulation for implantation of the ovum if it has
been fertilised. Otherwise, the secretory activity wanes
during the following 7 days with increased luminal
secretions and a frayed and ragged luminal border of the
cells lining the glands. This phase is under the
predominant influence of progesterone and is called
secretory phase. Eventually, the endometrium is sloughed
away at menstruation followed by beginning of the fresh
cycle (Fig. 24.9).
Endometrial stroma in the pre-ovulatory phase or
proliferative phase is generally dense and compact,
composed of oval to spindled cells. In the post-ovulatory
phase or secretory phase, the stroma is loose and
oedematous, composed of large, pale and polyhedral cells.
The true decidual reaction of the stroma occurs if the
pregnancy has taken place. However, decidual reaction
may be suggested in the absence of pregnancy due to
extreme response to progesterone. Thus, it may be
impossible to distinguish an advanced progestational
endometrium from early pregnancy except for the
presence of trophoblastic tissue.
EFFECTS OF HORMONES
In addition to the changes that take place during the normal
menstrual cycle, the endometrium undergoes morphologic
changes when hormonal preparations are administered, or
during pregnancy and menopause.

CHAPTER 24
The Female Genital Tract
Oestrogen and Progesterone
Oestrogen produces the characteristic changes of
proliferative phase at the time of menopause and in young
women with anovulatory cycles as occurs in Stein-Leventhal
syndrome. The therapeutic addition of progesterone
produces secretory pattern in an oestrogen-primed
endometrium. Oestrogen-progesterone combination
hormonal therapy is employed for control of conception.
The sequential type of oestrogen-progesterone oral
contraceptives act by producing prolonged oestrogenic
effect past the time of ovulation and implantation so that
the secretion is delayed until about 25th day, followed by
progestational effect and shedding. Repeated cyclic
administration with combination therapy such as after long-
term use of oral contraceptives produces inactive-looking,
small and atrophic endometrial glands, and compact
decidua-like stroma.
Pregnancy
The implantation of a fertilised ovum results in interruption
of the endometrial cycle. The endometrial glands are enlarged
with abundant glandular secretions and the stromal cells
become more plump, polygonal with increased cytoplasm
termed decidual reaction. About 25% cases of uterine or
extrauterine pregnancy show hyperactive secretory state
called Arias-Stella reaction. It is characterised by
hyperchromatic, atypical, tall cells lining the glands and the
glandular epithelium may show multilayering and budding
which may be mistaken for an adenocarcinoma.
Menopause
The onset of menopause is heralded with hormonal
transition and consequent varying morphologic changes in
the endometrium. Most commonly, the senile endometrium,
as it is generally called, is thin and atrophic with inactive
glands and fibrous stroma. However, some of the glands
may show cystic dilatation. Sometimes, retrogressive
hyperplasia is seen which is characterised by Swiss-cheese
pattern of glands resembling endometrial hyperplasia but
composed of inactive retrogressive lining epithelium. There
is intermingling of cystic and dilated glands with small and
atrophic glands. Postmenopausal endometrium may show
actual active hyperplasia under the stimulatory influence
of post-menopausal oestrogen originating from the ovary
or adrenal gland.
DYSFUNCTIONAL UTERINE BLEEDING (DUB)
Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) may be defined as
excessive bleeding occurring during or between menstrual
periods without a causative uterine lesion such as tumour,
polyp, infection, hyperplasia, trauma, blood dyscrasia or
pregnancy. DUB occurs most commonly in association with
anovulatory cycles which are most frequent at the two
extremes of menstrual life i.e. either when the ovarian
function is just beginning (menarche) or when it is waning
off (menopause). Anovulation is the result of prolonged and
excessive oestrogenic stimulation without the development
of progestational phase. The causes for anovulation at diffe-
rent ages are as follows:
1.
In pre-puberty: precocious puberty of hypothalamic,
pituitary or ovarian origin.
2.
In adolescence: anovulatory cycles at the onset of
menstruation.
3.
In reproductive age: complications of pregnancy, endo-
metrial hyperplasia, carcinoma, polyps, leiomyomas and
adenomyosis.
4.
 At premenopause: anovulatory cycles, irregular shedding,
endometrial hyperplasia, carcinoma and polyps.
Figure 24.9
Sequential physiologic patterns of endometrium.

732
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
5.
At perimenopause: endometrial hyperplasia, carcinoma,
polyps and senile atrophy.
It has been observed that women who ovulate may also
occasionally have anovulatory cycles. In addition to
anovulatory cycles, DUB may occur in inadequate luteal phase
that manifests clinically as infertility (ovulatory dysfunctional
bleeding). In such cases, the premenstrual endometrial biopsy
shows histologic lag of more than 2 days.
ENDOMETRITIS AND MYOMETRITIS
Inflammatory involvement of the endometrium and
myometrium are uncommon clinical problems; myometritis
is seen less frequently than endometritis and occurs in
continuation with endometrial infections. Endometritis and
myometritis may be acute or chronic.
Acute form generally results from 3 types of causes—
puerperal (following full-term delivery, abortion and
retained products of conception), intrauterine contraceptive
device (IUCD), and extension of gonorrheal infection from
the cervix and vagina.
Chronic form is more common and occurs by the same
causes which result in acute phase. In addition, tuberculous
endometritis is an example of specific chronic inflammation,
uncommon in the Western countries but not so uncommon
in developing countries. Its incidence in India is reported to
be approximately in 5% of women.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. In acute endometritis and
myometritis, there is progressive infiltration of the endo-
metrium, myometrium and parametrium by polymorphs
and marked oedema. Chronic nonspecific endometritis and
myometritis are characterised by infiltration of plasma cells
alongwith lymphocytes and macrophages. Tuberculous
endometritis is almost always associated with tuberculous
salpingitis and shows small non-caseating granulomas
(Fig. 24.10).
ADENOMYOSIS
Adenomyosis is defined as abnormal distribution of histo-
logically benign endometrial tissue within the myometrium
alongwith myometrial hypertrophy. The term adenomyoma
is used for actually circumscribed mass made up of
endometrium and smooth muscle tissue. Adenomyosis is
found in 15-20% of all hysterectomies. Pathogenesis of the
condition remains unexplained. The possible underlying
cause of the invasiveness and increased proliferation of the
endometrium into the myometrium appears to be either a
metaplasia or oestrogenic stimulation due to endocrine
dysfunction of the ovary. Clinically, the patients of adeno-
myosis generally complain of menorrhagia, colicky
dysmenorrhoea and menstrual pain in the sacral or
sacrococcygeal regions.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the uterus may
be slightly or markedly enlarged. On cut section, there is
diffuse thickness of the uterine wall with presence of
coarsely trabecular, ill-defined areas of haemorrhages.
Microscopically, the diagnosis is based on the finding of
normal, benign endometrial islands composed of glands
as well as stroma deep within the muscular layer. The
minimum distance between the endometrial islands
within the myometrium and the basal endometrium
should be one low-power microscopic field (2-3 mm) for
making the diagnosis (Fig. 24.11). Associated muscle
hypertrophy is generally present.
ENDOMETRIOSIS
Endometriosis refers to the presence of endometrial glands
and stroma in abnormal locations outside the uterus.
Endometriosis and adenomyosis are closely interlinked, so
much so that some gynaecologists have termed adenomyosis
Figure 24.10
Tuberculous endometritis. The stroma has caseating
epithelioid cell granulomas having Langhans’ giant cells and peripheral
layer of lymphocytes.

CHAPTER 24
The Female Genital Tract
as endometriosis interna and the other category termed as
endometriosis externa for similar appearance at the extrauterine
sites. However, the two differ as regards age, fertility and
histogenesis and thus endometriosis should be regarded as
a distinct clinicopathologic entity.
The chief locations where the abnormal endometrial
development may occur are as follows (in descending order
of frequency): ovaries, uterine ligaments, rectovaginal
septum, pelvic peritoneum, laparotomy scars, and
infrequently in the umbilicus, vagina, vulva, appendix and
hernial sacs.
The histogenesis of endometriosis has been a debatable
matter for years. Currently, however, the following 3 theories
of its histogenesis are described:
1.
Transplantation or regurgitation theory is based on the
assumption that ectopic endometrial tissue is transplanted
from the uterus to an abnormal location by way of fallopian
tubes due to regurgitation of menstrual blood.
2.
Metaplastic theory suggests that ectopic endometrium
develops in situ from local tissues by metaplasia of the
coelomic epithelium.
3.
Vascular or lymphatic dissemination explains the develop-
ment of endometrial tissue at extrapelvic sites by these routes.
Endometriosis is characteristically a disease of
reproductive years of life. Clinical signs and symptoms
include intrapelvic bleeding from implants, severe
dysmenorrhoea, pelvic pain, dyspareunia and infertility.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the appearance
of endometriosis varies widely depending upon the
location and extent of the disease. Typically, the foci of
endometriosis appear as blue or brownish-black
underneath the surface of the sites mentioned. Often, these
foci are surrounded by fibrous tissue resulting in
adherence to adjacent structures. The ovary is the most
common site of endometriosis and shows numerous cysts
varying in diameter from 0.1 to 2.5 cm. Ovarian
involvement is often bilateral. Larger cysts, 3-5 cm in
diameter, filled with old dark brown blood form ‘chocolate
cysts’ of the ovary.
Histologically, the diagnosis is simple and rests on ident-
ification of foci of endometrial glands and stroma, old or
new haemorrhages, haemosiderin-laden macrophages
and surrounding zone of inflammation and fibrosis
(Fig. 24.12).
ENDOMETRIAL HYPERPLASIAS
Endometrial hyperplasia is a condition characterised by
proliferative patterns of glandular and stromal tissues and
commonly associated with prolonged, profuse and irregular
uterine bleeding in a menopausal or postmenopausal
woman. It may be emphasised here that the syndrome of
DUB with which endometrial hyperplasia is commonly
associated is a clinical entity, while hyperplasia is a
pathologic term. Hyperplasia results from prolonged
oestrogenic stimulation unopposed with any progestational
activity. Such conditions include Stein-Leventhal syndrome,
functioning granulosa-theca cell tumours, adrenocortical
hyperfunction and prolonged administration of oestrogen.
Endometrial hyperplasia is clinically significant due to the
presence of cytologic atypia which is closely linked to endo-
metrial carcinoma.
The following classification of endometrial hyperplasias
is widely employed by most gynaecologic pathologists:
1.
Simple hyperplasia without atypia (Cystic glandular
hyperplasia).
2.
Complex hyperplasia without atypia (Complex non-
atypical hyperplasia).
3.
Complex hyperplasia with atypia (Complex atypical
hyperplasia).
SIMPLE HYPERPLASIA WITHOUT ATYPIA (CYSTIC
GLANDULAR HYPERPLASIA). Commonly termed
cystic glandular hyperplasia (CGH), this form of
endometrial hyperplasia is characterised by the presence
of varying-sized glands, many of which are large and
cystically dilated and are lined by atrophic epithelium.
Mitoses are scanty and there is no atypia. The stroma
between the glands is sparsely cellular and oedematous
(Fig. 24.13,A).
There is minimal risk (1%) of adenocarcinoma developing
in cystic hyperplasia.
COMPLEX HYPERPLASIA WITHOUT ATYPIA
(COMPLEX NON-ATYPICAL HYPERPLASIA). This
type of hyperplasia shows distinct proliferative pattern.
The glands are increased in number, exhibit variation in
size and are irregular in shape. The glands are lined by
multiple layers of tall columnar epithelial cells with large
nuclei which have not lost basal polarity and there is no
significant atypia. The glandular epithelium at places is
thrown into papillary infolds or out-pouchings into
adjacent stroma i.e. there is crowding and complexity of
Figure 24.12

section in the past. Dense fibrocollagenic tissue contains endometrial
glands, stroma and evidence of preceding old haemorrhage.

734
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
glands without cytologic atypia. The stroma is generally
dense, cellular and compact (Fig. 24.13,B).
The malignant potential of complex hyperplasia in the
absence of cytologic atypia is 3%.
COMPLEX HYPERPLASIA WITH ATYPIA (COMP-
LEX ATYPICAL HYPERPLASIA). Some authors have
suggested the terms such as endometrial intraepithelial
neoplasia (EIN) or carcinoma in situ for this form of
endometrial hyperplasia. Complex hyperplasia with
atypia is distinguished from complex non-atypical
hyperplasia by the presence of ‘atypical cells’ in the
hyperplastic epithelium. The extent of cytologic atypia
may be mild, moderate or severe. The cytologic features
present in these cells include loss of polarity, large size,
irregular and hyperchromatic nuclei, prominent
nucleoli, and altered nucleocytoplasmic ratio
(Fig. 24.13,C).
Complex atypical hyperplasia is a precancerous condition
and its malignant transformation is related to the degree of
cytologic atypia. About 20-25% cases of untreated atypical
hyperplasia progress to carcinoma.

Three forms of endometrial hyperplasias.

CHAPTER 24
The Female Genital Tract
TUMOURS OF ENDOMETRIUM AND MYOMETRIUM
Tumours arising from endometrium and myometrium may
be benign or malignant. They may originate from different
tissues as under:
Endometrial glands—endometrial polyps, endometrial
carcinoma.
Endometrial stroma—stromal nodules, stromal sarcoma.
Smooth muscle of the myometrium—leiomyoma,
leiomyosarcoma.
Mullerian mesoderm—mixed mesodermal or mullerian
tumours.
Out of these, endometrial polyps, endometrial carcinoma,
leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas are relatively more
common and are described below.
Endometrial Polyps
‘Uterine polyp’ is clinical term used for a polypoid growth
projecting into the uterine lumen and may be composed of
benign lesions (e.g. endometrial or mucous polyp,
leiomyomatous polyp and placental polyp), or malignant
polypoid tumours (e.g. endometrial carcinoma, choriocar-
cinoma and sarcoma). The most common variety, however,
is the one having the structure like that of endometrium and
is termed endometrial or mucus polyp. They are more common
in the perimenopausal age group. Small endometrial polyps
generally remain asymptomatic and are detected
incidentally. The larger ones may ulcerate, degenerate and
result in clinical bleeding.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, endometrial
polyps may be single or multiple, usually sessile and small
(0.5 to 3 cm in diameter) but occasionally they are large
and pedunculated.
Histologically, they are essentially made up of mixture
of endometrial glands and stroma. The histologic pattern
of the endometrial tissue in the polyp may resemble either
functioning endometrium or hyperplastic endometrium
of cystic hyperplasia type, the latter being more common.
Rarely, a large endometrial polyp may undergo malignant
change.
Endometrial Carcinoma
Carcinoma of the endometrium, commonly called uterine
cancer, is the most common pelvic malignancy in females in
the United States and Eastern Europe but is uncommon in
Asia where cervical cancer continues to be the leading cancer
in women. Whereas the decline in the incidence of cervical
cancer in the developed countries is due to aggressive cervical
screening programme leading to early detection and cure of
in situ stage, increased frequency of endometrial carcinoma
in these countries may be due to longevity of women’s life
to develop this cancer of older females. It is primarily a
disease of postmenopausal women, the peak incidence at
onset being 6th to 7th decades of life and is uncommon below
the age of 40 years. The most important presenting complaint
is abnormal bleeding in postmenopausal woman or excessive
flow in the premenopausal years.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The exact etiology of endometrial
cancer remains unknown. However, a few factors associated
with increased frequency of its development are chronic
unopposed oestrogen excess, obesity, diabetes, hypertension
and nulliparous state. There is irrefutable evidence of
relationship of endometrial carcinoma with prolonged oestrogenic
stimulation. These evidences are as under:
1.
Endometrial carcinoma has association with endometrial
hyperplasia (discussed above) in which there is unopposed
chronic hyperoestrogenism and frequent anovulatory cycles.
2.
In postmenopausal years when endometrial carcinoma
occurs characteristically, there is excessive synthesis of
oestrogen in the body from adrenal as well as from ovarian
sources.
3.
Women having oestrogen-secreting tumours (e.g. granu-
losa cell tumour) have increased risk of developing
synchronous endometrial cancer.
4.
Patients receiving prolonged exogenous oestrogen
therapy are at higher risk of developing this cancer.
5. Women of breast cancer receiving tamoxifen for prolonged
period have 2-fold increased risk of developing uterine
cancer.
6.
Prolonged administration of oestrogen to laboratory
animals can produce endometrial hyperplasia and
carcinoma.
7.
Women with gonadal agenesis rarely develop endo-
metrial carcinoma.
Pathogenetically, papillary serous variant of endometrial
carcinoma is associated with mutation in p53 tumour
suppressor gene while endometrioid carcinoma has mutation
in PTEN gene located on chromosome 10. The role of heredity
in pathogenesis of endometrial cancer is supported by higher
incidence in hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC)
syndrome (having simultaneous cancers of the colon and
endometrioid adenocarcinoma) and in Cowden syndrome
(having simultaneous cancers of the breast, thyroid, and
endometrium).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, endometrial
carcinoma may have 2 patterns—localised polypoid tumour,
or a diffuse tumour; the latter being more common
(Fig. 24.14). The tumour protrudes into the endometrial
cavity as irregular, friable and grey-tan mass. Extension
of the growth into the myometrium may be identified by
the presence of soft, friable and granular tissue in cut
section. In advanced disease, the involvement may extend
beyond the physiologic limits—into the cervical canal, into
the peritoneum, besides lymphatic metastases and
haematogenous metastases to distant sites such as lungs,
liver, bones and other organs.
Histologically, most endometrial carcinomas are
adenocarcinomas, commonly termed endometrioid
adenocarcinomas due to their resemblance with normal
endometrium. Depending upon the pattern of glands and
individual cell changes, these may be well-differentiated,
moderately-differentiated or poorly-differentiated.
Well-differentiated adenocarcinoma is characterised by
increase in the number of glands which are closely packed

736
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
sometimes showing ‘back-to-back crowding’ due to
obliterated intervening stroma. The glandular epithelium
shows stratification, formation of tufting and papillae and
atypical changes. Most growths are well-differentiated
(Fig. 24.15).
Moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma shows all the
above features alongwith presence of some solid sheets
of malignant cells.
Poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma is characterised by
presence of solid sheets and ribbons of malignant epithe-
lial cells which show marked cytologic atypia and frequent
mitoses. Glandular pattern is hard to find.
Cases can also be categorised as regards histologic
grade as follows:
G1: Well-differentiated (predominantly glandular).
G2: Moderately-differentiated (glandular and partly solid
areas).
G3: Poorly-differentiated (predominantly solid).
Papillary serous carcinoma of the endometrium resembling
its ovarian counterpart is distinct since it occurs in the
background of atrophic endometrium and is more
aggressive. Uncommon histologic variants of endometrial carci-
noma are: adenocarcinoma with squamous metaplasia
(adenoacanthoma), adenosquamous carcinoma (when both
components are frankly malignant), clear cell carcinoma,
mucinous adenocarcinoma and papillary serous carcinoma.
Carcinoma of the endometrium is categorised into four
stages as per FIGO classification given in Table 24.5.

737
CHAPTER 24
The Female Genital Tract
Leiomyoma
Leiomyomas or fibromyomas, commonly called fibroids by
the gynaecologists, are the most common uterine tumours
of smooth muscle origin, often admixed with variable amount
of fibrous tissue component. About 20% of women above
the age of 30 years harbour uterine myomas of varying size.
Vast majority of them are benign and cause no symptoms.
Malignant transformation occurs in less than 0.5% of
leiomyomas. Symptomatic cases may produce abnormal
uterine bleeding, pain, symptoms due to compression of
surrounding structures and infertility.
The cause of leiomyomas is unknown but the possible
stimulus to their proliferation is oestrogen. This is evidenced
by increase in their size in pregnancy (Fig. 24.16,C) and high
dose oestrogen-therapy and their regression following
menopause and castration. Other possible factors implicated
in its etiology are human growth hormone and sterility.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Leiomyomas are most
frequently located in the uterus where they may occur
within the myometrium (intramural or interstitial), the
serosa (subserosal), or just underneath the endometrium
(submucosal). Subserosal and submucosal leiomyomas
may develop pedicles and protrude as pedunculated
myomas. Leiomyomas may involve the cervix or broad
ligament.
Grossly, irrespective of their location, leiomyomas are
often multiple, circumscribed, firm, nodular, grey-white
masses of variable size. On cut section, they exhibit
characteristic whorled pattern (Fig. 24.16, A,B).
Histologically, they are essentially composed of 2 tissue
elements—whorled bundles of smooth muscle cells
admixed with variable amount of connective tissue. The
smooth muscle cells are uniform in size and shape with
abundant cytoplasm and central oval nuclei (Fig. 24.17).
Cellular leiomyoma has preponderance of smooth
muscle elements and may superficially resemble leiomyo-
sarcoma but is distinguished from it by the absence of
mitoses (see below).
The pathologic appearance may be altered by
secondary changes in the leiomyomas; these include:
hyaline degeneration, cystic degeneration, infarction,
calcification, infection and suppuration, necrosis, fatty
change, and rarely, sarcomatous change.
Leiomyosarcoma
Leiomyosarcoma is an uncommon malignant tumour as
compared to its rather common benign counterpart. The
incidence of malignancy in pre-existing leiomyoma is less

than 0.5% but primary uterine sarcoma is less common than
that which arises in the leiomyoma. The peak age incidence
is seen in 4th to 6th decades of life. The symptoms produced
are nonspecific such as uterine enlargement and abnormal
uterine bleeding.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour may
form a diffuse, bulky, soft and fleshy mass, or a polypoid
mass projecting into lumen.
Histologically, though there are usually some areas
showing whorled arrangement of spindle-shaped smooth
muscle cells having large and hyperchromatic nuclei, the
hallmark of diagnosis and prognosis is the number of
mitoses per high power field (HPF). The essential
diagnostic criteria are: more than 10 mitoses per 10 HPF
with or without cellular atypia, or 5-10 mitoses per 10 HPF
with cellular atypia. More the number of mitoses per 10
HPF, worse is the prognosis.
Leiomyosarcoma is liable to recur after removal and
eventually metastasises to distant sites such as lungs, liver,
bone and brain.
FALLOPIAN TUBES
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The fallopian tube or oviducts are paired structures, each
extending from superior angle of the uterus laterally to the
region of the ovaries and running in the superior border of
the broad ligaments forming mesosalpinx. Each tube is
7-14 cm long and is divided into 4 parts—interstitial portion
in the uterine cornual wall; narrow isthmic portion; wider
ampullary region; and funnel-like distal infundibulum. The
infundibulum is fringed by fimbriae, the longest of which
called fimbria ovarica is attached to the ovary.
Histologically, the wall of tube has 4 coats—serous
forming the peritoneal covering, subserous consisting of
fibrovascular tissue, muscular composed of longitudinal and
circular smooth muscle layers, and tubal mucosa having 3
types of cells namely: ciliated, columnar and dark intercalated
cells. The tubal serosal covering may contain tiny nodular
masses of mesothelial cells forming Walthard’s cell rests.
The major conditions involving the fallopian tubes are
inflammations, ectopic tubal gestation, and endometriosis.
INFLAMMATIONS
Salpingitis and Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) by definition is a clinical
syndrome characterised by signs and symptoms of ascending
infection beginning in the vulva or vagina and spreading
through the entire genital tract. Although ascending route
of infection is the most common mode of spread, PID may
occur following abortion and puerperium, with use of
intrauterine contraceptive devices, or from local intra-
abdominal infections such as appendicitis with peritonitis.
In addition, haematogenous spread may occur, though this
route is more important in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis.
Most commonly, PID occurs as a venereally-transmitted
infection, chiefly caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and
Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Post-abortal and postpartum infections
are mainly caused by staphylococci, streptococci, coliform
bacteria, clostridia and pneumococci.
Patients generally complain of lower abdominal and
pelvic pain which is often bilateral, dysmenorrhoea,
menstrual abnormalities and fever with tachycardia. Long-
standing chronic PID may lead to infertility and adhesions
between small intestine and pelvic organs.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the fallopian
tubes are invariably involved bilaterally. The distal end
is blocked by inflammatory exudate and the lumina are
dilated. There may be formation of loculated tubo-ovarian
abscess involving the tube, ovary, broad ligament and
adjacent part of uterus.

oval nuclei.

739
CHAPTER 24
The Female Genital Tract
Microscopically, the appearance varies with the duration
of inflammatory process.
The process begins with acute salpingitis characterised
by oedema and intense acute inflammatory infiltrate of
neutrophils involving the tubal mucosa as well as wall.
The lumen is filled with purulent exudate consisting of
leucocytes and sloughed off epithelial cells.
The purulent process may extend to involve tube as
well as ovary causing salpingo-oophoritis and forming
tubo-ovarian abscess.
The escape of purulent exudate into the peritoneal
cavity produces pelvic peritonitis and pelvic abscess.
Pyosalpinx is distension of the fallopian tube with pus
due to occluded fimbrial end.
End-result of pyosalpinx after resorption of the puru-
lent exudate is hydrosalpinx in which the tube is thin-
walled, dilated and filled with clear watery fluid.
Acute salpingitis may resolve with treatment but some
cases pass into chronic salpingitis with infiltrate of
polymorphs, lymphocytes and plasma cells and fibrosis.
Salpingitis isthmica nodosa used to be considered
another manifestation of chronic salpingitis but currently
accepted pathogenesis of this lesion appears to be similar
to that of adenomyosis. Nevertheless, the appearance is
characterised by multiple nodules containing spaces
which are lined by benign tubal epithelium. Inflammatory
changes are scanty or absent.
Tuberculous Salpingitis
Tuberculous salpingitis is almost always secondary to focus
elsewhere in the body. The tubercle bacilli reach the tube,
most commonly by haematogenous route, generally from the
lungs, but occasionally from the urinary tract or abdominal
cavity. Tubal tuberculosis is always present when there is
tuberculosis of other female genital organs such as of
endometrium, cervix and lower genital tract. Though
infrequent in developed countries of the world, the incidence
of tubal tuberculosis in developing countries like India is
estimated to be about 5%; concomitant involvement of
endometrium is present in about 80% cases. It affects more
commonly young women in their active reproductive life and
the most common complaint is infertility.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tube is dila-
ted and contains purulent exudate though the fimbrial end
is generally patent. The tubal peritoneum as well as the
peritoneum in general is studded with yellowish tubercles.
Microscopically, typical caseating granulomas and
chronic inflammation are identified in the tubal serosa,
muscularis and mucosa.
ECTOPIC TUBAL PREGNANCY
The term ectopic tubal pregnancy is used for implantation
of a fertilised ovum in the tube. Though ectopic pregnancy
may rarely occur in the uterine horn, cornu, ovary and
abdominal cavity, tubal pregnancy is by far the most common
form of ectopic gestation (Fig. 24.18). Several factors which
predispose to ectopic tubal pregnancy are: PID, previous
tubal surgery, use of IUCD and congenital anomalies of the
female genital tract. The most frequent site of tubal pregnancy
is the ampullary portion and the least common is interstitial
pregnancy. Ectopic tubal pregnancy is a potentially
hazardous problem because of rupture which is followed by
intraperitoneal haemorrhage.
TUMOURS AND TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS
Tumours in the fallopian tubes are rare. Relatively more
common are hydatids of Morgagni or parovarian cysts which
are unilocular, thin-walled cysts hanging from the tubal
fimbriae. Rare tumours include adenomatoid tumours,
leiomyomas, teratomas, adenocarcinomas and choriocarci-
noma all of which are similar in morphology to such tumours
elsewhere in the body.
OVARIES
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The ovaries are paired bean-shaped organs hanging from
either tube by a mesentery called the mesovarium, the lateral
suspensory ligament and the ovarian ligament. The lateral
suspensory ligament of the ovary contains blood vessels,
lymphatics and plexuses of nerves. Each ovary measures 2.5-
5 cm in length, 1.5-3 cm in breadth and 0.7-1.5 cm in width
and weighs 4-8 gm.
Histologically, the ovarian structure consists of covering
by coelomic epithelium, outer cortex and inner medulla
(Fig. 24.19).
Coelomic epithelium. The surface of the ovary is covered
by a single layer of cuboidal epithelial cells.
Cortex. During active reproductive life, the cortex is broad
and constitutes the predominant component of the ovary.
The cortex contains numerous ovarian follicles and their
derivative structures. Each follicle consists of a central germ
cell ovum surrounded by specialised gonadal stroma. This
stroma consists of granulosa cells encircling the ovum, and
concentrically-arranged plump spindle-shaped theca cells. In
infancy, the granulosa cells form a single layer of cuboidal
Figure 24.18
Ectopic tubal gestation. The lumen of the fallopian
tube is dilated in the middle and contains dark tan, haemorrhagic and
friable gestational tissue (sac, foetus and placenta).

740
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Histologically, they are lined by granulosa cells.
Occasionally, however, there may be difficulty in
distinguishing between a large cyst of coelomic epithelial
origin (serous cyst) lined by flattened epithelial cells and a
cyst of follicular origin. Such cases are appropriately
designated as ‘simple cysts’.
Luteal cysts are formed by rupture and sealing of corpus
haemorrhagicum. The wall of these cysts is composed of
yellowish luteal tissue (lutein = yellow pigment).
Histologically, luteal cysts are commonly lined by
luteinised granulosa cells. Lining by predominantly lutei-
nised theca cells may also be seen in cystic ovaries in
association with hydatidiform mole and choriocarcinoma,
and rarely, in normal pregnancy. Corpus albicans cyst is a
variant of corpus luteum cyst in which there is
hyalinisation in the wall and distension of the cavity with
fluid.
Polycystic Ovary Disease (Stein-Leventhal Syndrome)
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a syndrome
characterised by oligomenorrhoea, anovulation, infertility,
hirsutism and obesity in young women having bilaterally
enlarged and cystic ovaries. The principal biochemical
abnormalities in most patients are excessive production of
androgens, and low levels of pituitary follicle stimulating
hormone (FSH). These endocrinologic abnormalities were
previously attributed to primary ovarian dysfunction as
evidenced by excellent results from wedge resection of the
ovary. Current concept of pathogenesis of PCOS is the
unbalanced release of FSH and LH by the pituitary. FSH is
inhibited to low levels by testosterone but the level of LH is
sufficient to cause luteinisation of ovarian theca and
granulosa cells which then secrete androgen inappropriately
and produce an abnormal state of anovulation. A hereditary
basis for the syndrome has been suggested in some cases.
PATHOLOGIC CHANGES. Grossly, the ovaries are
usually involved bilaterally and are at least twice the size
of the normal ovary. They are grey-white in colour and

cells around the ovum but later form several layers. Granu-
losa cells may form Call-Exner bodies normally as well as in
certain neoplastic conditions. Call-Exner bodies have a
central small round mass of dense pink material surrounded
by a rosette of granulosa cells. The granulosa component is
avascular and draws its nutrition from the highly vascular
theca component. The theca component has 2 parts—
luteinised theca layer called theca interna, and outer
condensed ovarian stroma called theca externa. Granulosa
cells and follicle-associated (luteinised) theca cells produce
oestrogen. Fully mature ovarian follicle called graafian follicle
bursts releasing the ovum and becomes transformed into
corpus luteum which is the principal source of progesterone
that brings about secretory endometrial pattern. The corpus
luteum is later replaced by corpus albicans. In addition to
specialised gonadal stroma and follicles, the cortex contains
unspecialised ovarian stroma consisting of spindle-shaped
connective tissue cells and smooth muscle fibres.
Medulla. The ovarian medulla is primarily made up of
connective tissue fibres, smooth muscle cells and numerous
blood vessels, lymphatics and nerves. In addition, the
medulla may also contain clusters of hilus cell (or hilar-
Leydig cells) which may have androgenic role in contrast to
oestrogenic role of the ovarian cortex.
The major pathologic lesions of the ovary are the non-
neoplastic cysts and ovarian tumours.
NON-NEOPLASTIC CYSTS
The most common of the non-neoplastic cysts of the ovary
are tubo-ovarian inflammatory mass (discussed above) and
follicular and luteal cysts. Polycystic ovarian disease of Stein-
Leventhal syndrome is another cause of cystic ovary.
Follicular and Luteal Cysts
Normally follicles and corpus luteum do not exceed a
diameter of 2 cm. When their diameter is greater than 3 cm,
they are termed as cysts.
Follicular cysts are frequently multiple, filled with clear
serous fluid and may attain a diameter upto 8 cm. When
large, they produce clinical symptoms.

The Female Genital Tract
ovarian tumours. However, a few risk factors have been
identified as under:
1. Nulliparity. There is higher incidence of ovarian cancer in
unmarried women and married women with low or no
parity.
2. Heredity. About 10% cases of ovarian cancer occur in
women with family history of ovarian or breast cancer.
Women with hereditary breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility
have mutation in tumour suppressor BRCA gene—BRCA-1
(located on chromosome 17q) and BRCA-2 (located on
chromosome 13q). The risk in BRCA-1 carriers is higher
compared to that in BRCA-2 carriers. Interestingly, men in
such families have an increased risk of prostate cancer. In
addition to BRCA mutation, other molecular abnormalities
in ovarian cancers include mutation of p53 tumour
suppressor gene and overexpression of ERBB-2 and K-RAS
genes.
3. Complex genetic syndromes. Besides the above two main
factors, several complex genetic syndromes are associated
with ovarian tumours as follows:
i) Lynch syndrome associated with increased risk of ovarian
cancer.
ii) Peutz-Jeghers syndrome with ovarian sex cord-stromal
tumours.
iii) Gonadal dysgenesis with gonadoblastoma.
iv) Nevoid basal cell carcinoma with ovarian fibromas.
CLINICAL FEATURES AND CLASSIFICATION
In general, benign ovarian tumours are more common,
particularly in young women between the age of 20 and 40
years, and account for 80% of all ovarian neoplasms.
Malignant tumours may be primary or metastatic, ovary
being a common site for receiving metastases from various
other cancers. Primary malignant ovarian tumours are more
common in older women between the age of 40 and 60 years.
Although certain specific tumours have distinctive
features such as elaboration of hormones, most benign and
malignant ovarian tumours are discovered when they grow
sufficiently to cause abdominal discomfort and distension.
Urinary tract and gastrointestinal tract symptoms are
frequently associated due to compression by the tumour.
Ascites is common in both benign and malignant ovarian
tumours. Menstrual irregularities may or may not be present.
Some ovarian tumours are bilateral. Malignant tumours
usually spread beyond the ovary to other sites before the
diagnosis is made.
A simplified classification proposed by the WHO with
minor modifications has been widely adopted (Table 24.6).
According to this classification, ovarian tumours arise from
normally-occurring cellular components of the ovary
(Fig. 24.19). Five major groups have been described:
I.
Tumours of surface epithelium (common epithelial
tumours)
II. Germ cell tumours
III. Sex cord-stromal tumours
IV. Miscellaneous tumours
V. Metastatic tumours

cells and represent follicles in various stages of maturation

OVARIAN TUMOURS
The ovary is third most common site of primary malignancy
in the female genital tract, preceded only by endometrial and
cervical cancer. Both benign and malignant tumours occur
in the ovaries.

endometrium), not much is known about the etiology of

Figure 24.20
Diagrammatic representation of general histologic criteria to distinguish benign, borderline (atypical proliferating) and malignant
surface epithelial tumours of the ovary.
I.
TUMOURS OF SURFACE EPITHELIUM
(COMMON EPITHELIAL TUMOURS)
Tumours derived from the surface (coelomic) epithelium
called common epithelial tumours form the largest group of
ovarian tumours. This group constitutes about 60-70% of all
ovarian neoplasms and 90% of malignant ovarian tumours.
The common epithelial tumours are of 3 major types—serous,
mucinous and endometrioid, though mixtures of these epithelia
may occur in the same tumour. These tumours frequently
have prominent cystic component which may have a single
or multiple loculations and hence the descriptive prefix
cystadeno- in these tumours. In addition, surface epithelial
tumours may differentiate along urothelium to form Brenner
tumour, and along mesonephroid pattern forming clear cell
(mesonephroid) adenocarcinoma.
Depending upon the aggressiveness, the surface epithe-
lial tumours are divided into 3 groups: clearly benign, clearly
malignant, and borderline (or atypical proliferating or low-grade)
malignant tumours. In general, the criteria for diagnosis of
these 3 grades of aggressiveness are as follows (Fig. 24.20):
Clearly benign tumours are lined by a single layer of
well-oriented columnar epithelium. Papillary projections, if
present, are covered by the same type of epithelium without
any invasion into fibrovascular stromal stalk.
Clearly malignant tumours have anaplastic epithelial
component, multilayering, loss of basal polarity and
unquestionable stromal invasion. The prognosis of these
tumours is very poor.
Borderline (atypical proliferating) tumours or tumours
with low malignant potential have some morphological
features of malignancy, apparent detachment of cellular
clusters from their site of origin and essential absence of
stromal invasion. Morphological features of malignancy
which may be present in varying combinations include: strati-
fication (2-3 layers) of the epithelial cells but generally
maintained basal polarity of nuclei, moderate nuclear
abnormalities, and some mitotic activity. This group has a
much better prognosis than frankly malignant tumours of
the ovary.
Based on this categorisation of biologic behaviour, groups
of surface epithelial ovarian tumours are described below:
Serous Tumours
Serous tumours comprise the largest group constituting
about 20% of all ovarian tumours and 40% of malignant
ovarian tumours. They are called serous tumours because of
the presence of clear, watery, serous fluid in these
predominantly cystic tumours. About 60% of serous tumours
are benign, 15% borderline and 25% malignant. Only 20% of
benign tumours occur bilaterally, whereas 65% of both
borderline and malignant serous tumours have bilateral
ovarian involvement. Serous tumours occur most commonly
in 2nd to 5th decades of life, the malignant forms being more
frequent in later life.
Histogenesis of the serous tumours is by metaplasia from
the surface (coelomic) epithelium or mesothelium which
differentiates along tubal-type of epithelium.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, benign,
borderline and malignant serous tumours are large (above
5 cm in diameter) and spherical masses. Small masses are
generally unilocular while the larger serous cysts are
multiloculated similar to the mucinous variety, but differ
from the latter in containing serous fluid rather than the
viscid fluid of mucinous tumours. Malignant serous
tumours may have solid areas in the cystic mass. Exophytic
as well as intracystic papillary projections may be present
in all grades of serous tumours but are more frequent in
malignant tumours termed papillary serous cystadeno-
carcinomas (Fig. 24.21).
Histologically, the features are as follows:
1.
Serous cystadenoma is characteristically lined by
properly-oriented low columnar epithelium which is
sometimes ciliated and resembles tubal epithelium.
Microscopic papillae may be found.

743
CHAPTER 24
The Female Genital Tract
Figure 24.21
Papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary. It
shows an enlarged ovary replaced with a large unilocular cyst with
intracystic papillae (arrow).
2.
Borderline (atypical proliferating) serous tumour
usually has stratification (2-3 layers) of benign serous type
of epithelium. There is detachment of cell clusters from
their site of origin and moderate features of malignancy
but there is absence of stromal invasion.
3.
Serous cystadenocarcinoma has multilayered
malignant cells which show loss of polarity, presence of
solid sheets of anaplastic epithelial cells and definite
evidence of stromal invasion. Papillae formations are more
frequent in malignant variety and may be associated with
psammoma bodies but mere presence of psammoma
bodies is not indicative of malignancy (Fig. 24.22).
Mucinous Tumours
Mucinous tumours are somewhat less common than serous
tumours and constitute about 20% of all ovarian tumours
and 10% of all ovarian cancers. Over 80% are benign, 10-
15% are borderline (atypical proliferating) and 5-10% are
malignant. These predominantly cystic tumours contain
mucin which was previously described as pseudomucin.
Well-differentiated borderline mucinous tumours are
associated with mucinous ascites termed pseudomyxoma
peritonei (page 579). As compared with serous tumours,
mucinous tumours are more commonly unilateral. Benign
mucinous tumours occur bilaterally in 5% of cases while
borderline and malignant are bilateral in 20%. As per current
concept, the diagnosis of primary ovarian mucinous
adenocarcinoma is made after excluding metastatic tumours
to the ovary, while bilateral mucinous adenocarcinoma of
the ovary is invariably metastatic deposits to the ovary.
Mucinous tumours occur principally between 2nd and 5th
decades of life. Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma usually
develops in women above the age of 40 years.
Histogenesis of mucinous tumours, in line with that of
serous tumours, is by metaplasia from the coelomic
epithelium that differentiates along endocervical type or
intestinal type of mucosa.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, mucinous
tumours are much larger than serous tumours. They are
smooth-surfaced cysts with characteristic multiloculations
containing thick and viscid gelatinous fluid (Fig. 24.23).
Benign tumours generally have thin wall and septa
dividing the loculi are also thin and often translucent, but

the inner surface of the cyst and a few psammoma bodies. The stroma shows invasion by clusters of anaplastic tumour cells.

744
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
malignant varieties usually have thickened areas. In
younger patients, an element of teratoma may be
recognised in the firm areas of the tumour.
Histologically, the most distinctive feature is the charac-
teristic tall columnar nonciliated epithelium lining the
loculi (Fig. 24.24). Other features are as under:
1.
Mucinous cystadenoma is lined by a single layer of
these cells having basal nuclei and apical mucinous vacuo-
les. There is very little tendency to papillary proliferation
of the epithelium.
2.
Borderline (atypical proliferating) mucinous tumour
is identified by the same histologic criteria as for
borderline serous tumour i.e. stratification (usually 2-3 cell
thick) of typical epithelium without stromal invasion.
3.
Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma likewise is charac-
terised by piling up of malignant epithelium, at places
forming solid sheets, papillary formation, adenomatous
pattern and infiltration into stroma with or without pools
of mucin.
Endometrioid Tumours
Endometrioid tumours comprise about 5% of all ovarian
tumours. Most of them are malignant accounting for about
20% of all ovarian cancers. Benign and borderline forms are
very rare. They are called endometrioid carcinomas because
of the close resemblance of histologic pattern to that of uterine
endometrioid adenocarcinoma. About 40% of ovarian
endometrioid carcinomas have bilateral involvement. About
15-30% of cases have coexistent endometrial adeno-
carcinoma.
Histogenesis of these tumours in majority of cases is
believed to be from ovarian coelomic epithelium differen-

tiating towards endometrial type of epithelium. In view of
presence of endometriosis in a few cases of endometrioid
tumours, some authors have suggested malignant trans-
formation of endometriosis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, these tumours
are partly solid and partly cystic and may have foci of
haemorrhages, especially in benign variety.
Histologically, the endometrioid adenocarcinoma is
distinguished from serous and mucinous carcinomas by
typical glandular pattern that closely resembles that of
uterine endometrioid adenocarcinoma. There may be foci
of squamous metaplasia justifying the diagnosis of
adenoacanthoma. Papillary pattern and foci of serous and
mucinous carcinoma may also be found. Benign variety
closely resembles endometriosis with cystic change. There
are no clearly defined criteria for borderline endometrioid
tumours.
Clear Cell (Mesonephroid) Tumours
Clear cell (mesonephroid) tumours are almost always
malignant and comprise about 5% of all ovarian cancers; rare
benign variety is called clear cell adenofibroma. They are termed
clear cell or mesonephroid carcinomas because of the close
histologic resemblance to renal adenocarcinoma. They have
also been called as mesonephroma or mesonephric carcinoma
because of the questionable relationship to the mesonephric
structures.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, these tumours
are large, usually unilateral, partly solid and partly cystic.
Less than 10% are bilateral.
Histologically, clear cell or mesonephroid carcinoma is
characterised by tubules, glands, papillae, cysts and solid
sheets of tumour cells resembling cells of renal adeno-
carcinoma i.e. clear cells having abundant eosinophilic
cytoplasm rich in glycogen.
Brenner Tumour
Brenner tumours are uncommon and comprise about 2% of
all ovarian tumours. They are characteristically solid ovarian
tumours. Less than 10% of Brenner tumours are bilateral.
Most Brenner tumours are benign. Rarely, borderline form
is encountered called ‘proliferating Brenner tumour’ while
the one with carcinomatous change is termed ‘malignant
Brenner tumour’.
Histogenesis of the tumour is from coelomic epithelium
by metaplastic transformation into transitional epithelium
(urothelium).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, Brenner tumour
is typically solid, yellow-grey, firm mass of variable size.
Occasionally, a few scattered tiny cysts may be present
on cut section.
Histologically, Brenner tumour consists of nests, masses
and columns of epithelial cells, scattered in fibrous stroma
of the ovary. These epithelial cells resemble urothelial cells
which are ovoid in shape, having clear cytoplasm,
vesicular nuclei with characteristic nuclear groove called
‘coffee-bean’ nuclei.
II. GERM CELL TUMOURS
Ovarian germ cell tumours arising from germ cells which
produce the female gametes (i.e. ova) account for about 15-
20% of all ovarian neoplasms. The neoplastic germ cells may
follow one of the several lines of differentiation as shown in
Fig. 24.25. Nearly 95% of them are benign and occur chiefly
in young females, vast majority of them being benign cystic
teratomas (dermoid cysts). The remainder are malignant

746
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
germ cell tumours comprising a variety of morphologic forms
occurring chiefly in children and young adults and are highly
aggressive tumours. Most germ cell tumours of the ovaries
have their counterparts in the testis (Chapter 23) and
sometimes in the mediastinum but their frequency differs
from one site to the other. For instance, benign cystic teratoma
or dermoid cyst so common in ovaries is extremely rare in
the testis.
Teratomas
Teratomas are tumours composed of different types of tissues
derived from the three germ cell layers—ectoderm, meso-
derm and endoderm, in different combinations. In view of
wide spectrum of tissue elements found in these teratomas,
their histogenesis has been a matter of speculation for a long
time. Cytogenetic studies have revealed that these tumours
arise from a single germ cell (ovum) after its first meiotic
division.
Teratomas are divided into 3 types: mature (benign),
immature (malignant), and monodermal or highly
specialised teratomas.
MATURE (BENIGN) TERATOMA. Vast majority of ovarian
teratomas are benign and cystic and have the predominant
ectodermal elements, often termed clinically as dermoid cyst.
Infrequently, mature teratoma may be solid and benign and
has to be distinguished from immature or malignant
teratoma. Benign cystic teratomas are more frequent in young
women during their active reproductive life. The tumour is
bilateral in 10% of cases.
Grossly, benign cystic teratoma or dermoid cyst is
characteristically a unilocular cyst, 10-15 cm in diameter,
usually lined by the skin and hence its name. On
sectioning, the cyst is filled with paste-like sebaceous
secretions and desquamated keratin admixed with masses
of hair. The cyst wall is thin and opaque grey-white. Gene-
rally, in one area of the cyst wall, a solid prominence is
seen (Rokitansky’s protuberance) where tissue elements
such as tooth, bone, cartilage and various other odd tissues
are present (Fig. 24.26). Less often, the cyst may contain
mucoid material.
Microscopically, the most prominent feature is the lining
of the cyst wall by stratified squamous epithelium and its
adnexal structures such as sebaceous glands, sweat glands
and hair follicles (Fig. 24.27). Though ectodermal
derivatives are most prominent features, tissues of
mesodermal and endodermal origin are also commonly
present. Various other tissue components frequently
found in teratomas are bronchus, intestinal epithelium,
cartilage, bone, tooth, smooth muscle, neural tissue,
salivary gland, retina, pancreas and thyroid tissue. Thus,
viewing a benign cystic teratoma in different microscopic
fields reveals a variety of mature differentiated tissue
elements, producing kaleidoscopic patterns.
Less than 1% of patients with a dermoid cyst develop
malignant transformation of one of the tissue components,
most commonly squamous cell carcinoma.
IMMATURE (MALIGNANT) TERATOMA. Immature or
malignant teratomas of the ovary are rare and account for
approximately 0.2% of all ovarian tumours. They are
predominantly solid tumours that contain immature or
embryonal structures in contrast to the mature or adult
structures of the benign teratomas. They are more common
in prepubertal adolescents and young women under 20 years
of age.
Grossly, malignant teratoma is a unilateral solid mass
which on cut section shows characteristic variegated
appearance revealing areas of haemorrhages, necrosis,
tiny cysts and heterogeneous admixture of various tissue
elements.
Microscopically, parts of the tumour may show mature
tissues, while most of it is composed of immature tissues

The Female Genital Tract
having an embryonic appearance. Immature tissue
elements may differentiate towards cartilage, bone,
glandular structures, neural tissue etc, and are distributed
in spindle-shaped myxoid or undifferentiated sarcoma
cells. An important factor in grading and determining the
prognosis of immature teratoma is the relative amount of
immature neural tissue. Immature neural tissue can
undergo maturation even at the site of metastases over a
period of years. Immature teratoma may contain areas of
other germ cell tumours such as endodermal sinus
tumour, embryonal carcinoma and choriocarcinoma.
Grade I tumours having relatively mature elements and
confined to the ovary have a good prognosis, whereas grade
III immature teratomas with metastases have an extremely
poor prognosis.
MONODERMAL (SPECIALISED) TERATOMA. Mono-
dermal or highly specialised teratomas are rare and include
2 important examples—struma ovarii and carcinoid tumour.
Struma ovarii. It is a teratoma composed exclusively
of thyroid tissue, recognisable grossly as well as micros-
copically. Most often, the tumour has the appearance of a
follicular adenoma of the thyroid. Rarely, struma ovarii
may be hyperfunctioning and produce hyperthyroidism.
Carcinoid tumour. This is an ovarian teratoma arising
from argentaffin cells of intestinal epithelium in the
teratoma. Ovarian carcinoid may also hyperfunction and
produce 5-HT and consequent carcinoid syndrome.
Struma-carcinoid is a rare combination of struma
ovarii and ovarian carcinoid.
Dysgerminoma
Dysgerminoma is an ovarian counterpart of seminoma of
the testes (page 709). Dysgerminomas comprise about 2% of
all ovarian cancers. They occur most commonly in 2nd to
3rd decades. About 10% of them are bilateral. About 10% of
patients with dysgerminoma have elevated hCG level in the
plasma. All dysgerminomas are malignant and are extremely
radiosensitive.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, dysgerminoma
is a solid mass of variable size. Cut section of the tumour
is grey-white to pink, lobulated, soft and fleshy with foci
of haemorrhages and necrosis.
Histologically, their structure is similar to that of
seminoma of the testis (Fig. 24.28). The tumour cells are
arranged in diffuse sheets, islands and cords separated
by scanty fibrous stroma. The tumour cells are uniform
in appearance and large, with vesicular nuclei and clear
cytoplasm rich in glycogen. The fibrous stroma generally
contains lymphocytic infiltrate and sometimes may have
sarcoid granulomas.

Benign cystic teratoma. Microscopy shows characteristic lining of the cyst wall by epidermis and its appendages. Islands of
mature cartilage are also seen.

748
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Endodermal Sinus (Yolk Sac) Tumour
Endodermal sinus tumour or yolk sac tumour is the second
most common germ cell tumour occurring most frequently
in children and young women. More often, endodermal
sinus tumour is found in combination with other germ cell
tumours rather than in pure form. The tumour is rich in
alphafetoprotein (AFP) and α-1-antitrypsin. The tumour is
usually unilateral but may metastasise to the other ovary.
It is a highly aggressive and rapidly growing tumour.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
generally solid with areas of cystic degeneration.
Histologically, like its testicular counterpart, the endo-
dermal sinus tumour is characterised by the presence of
papillary projections having a central blood vessel with
perivascular layer of anaplastic embryonal germ cells.
Such structures resemble the endodermal sinuses of the
rat placenta (Schiller-Duval body) from which the tumour
derives its name. It is common to find intracellular and
extracelluar PAS-positive hyaline globules which are
composed of AFP (Fig. 24.29).
Choriocarcinoma
Choriocarcinoma in females is of 2 types—gestational and non-
gestational. Gestational choriocarcinoma of placental origin
is more common and considered separately later (page 752).
Pure primary non-gestational choriocarcinoma of ovarian
origin is rare while its combination with other germ cell
tumours is seen more often. The patients are usually young
girls under the age of 20 years. Morphologically, ovarian
choriocarcinoma is identical to gestational choriocarcinoma.
Ovarian choriocarcinoma is more malignant than that of
placental origin and disseminates widely via bloodstream
to the lungs, liver, bone, brain and kidneys. The marker for
both types of choriocarcinoma is hCG.
Other Germ Cell Tumours
Certain other germ cell tumours occasionally encountered
in the ovaries are embryonal carcinoma, polyembryoma and
mixed germ cell tumours. All these tumours are
morphologically identical to similar tumours occurring in
the testes (Chapter 24).
III. SEX CORD-STROMAL TUMOURS
Sex cord-stromal tumours of the ovaries comprise 5-10% of
all ovarian neoplasms. They arise from specialised ovarian
stromal cells of the developing gonads. Thus, these include
tumours originating from granulosa cells, theca cells and
Sertoli-Leydig cells. Since sex cord-stromal cells have
functional activity, most of these tumours elaborate steroid
hormones which may have feminising effects or
masculinising effects.
Granulosa-Theca Cell Tumours
Granulosa-theca cell tumours comprise about 5% of all
ovarian tumours. The group includes: pure granulosa cell
tumours, pure thecomas, combination of granulosa-theca cell
tumours and fibromas.
GRANULOSA CELL TUMOUR. Pure granulosa cell
tumours may occur at all ages. These tumours invade locally
but occasionally may have more aggressive and malignant
behaviour. Recurrences after surgical removal are common.
Most granulosa cell tumours secrete oestrogen which may
be responsible for precocious puberty in young girls, or in
older patients may produce endometrial hyperplasia,
endometrial adenocarcinoma and cystic disease of the breast.
Rarely, granulosa cell tumour may elaborate androgen which
may have masculinising effect on the patient.
Grossly, granulosa cell tumour is a small, solid, partly
cystic and usually unilateral tumour. Cut section of solid
areas is yellowish-brown (Fig. 24.30).
Figure 24.30
Solid ovarian tumour. Specimen of the uterus, cervix
and adnexa shows enlarged ovarian mass (arrow) on one side which on

Figure 24.29

characteristic Schiller-Duval bodies are present. Inset shows intra- and
extracellular hyaline globules.

CHAPTER 24
The Female Genital Tract
Figure 24.31
Granulosa cell tumour showing uniform granulosa cells and numerous rosette-like Call-Exner bodies containing central amorphous
pink material surrounded by granulosa cells.
Microscopically, the granulosa cells are arranged in a
variety of patterns including micro- and macrofollicular,
trabecular, bands and diffuse sheets. The microfollicular
pattern is characterised by the presence of characteristic
rosette-like structures, Call-Exner bodies, having central
rounded pink mass surrounded by a circular row of
granulosa cells (Fig. 24.31).
Morphologic appearance alone is a poor indicator of
clinical malignancy but presence of metastases and invasion
outside the ovary are considered better indicators of
aggressive behaviour.
THECOMA. Pure thecomas are almost always benign. They
occur more frequently in postmenopausal women.
Thecomas are typically oestrogenic. Endometrial
hyperplasia, endometrial carcinoma and cystic disease of
the breast are some of its adverse effects. Occasionally a
thecoma may secrete androgen and cause virilisation.
Grossly, thecoma is a solid and firm mass, 5-10 cm in
diameter. Cut section is yellowish.
Microscopically, thecoma consists of spindle-shaped theca
cells of the ovary admixed with variable amount of
hyalinised collagen. The cytoplasm of theca cells is lipid-
rich and vacuolated which reacts with lipid stains.
GRANULOSA-THECA CELL TUMOUR. Mixture of both
granulosa and theca cell elements in the same ovarian tumour
is seen in some cases with elaboration of oestrogen.
FIBROMA. Fibromas of the ovary are more common and
account for about 5% of all ovarian tumours. These tumours
are hormonally inert but some of them are associated with
pleural effusion and benign ascites termed Meig’s syndrome.
Grossly, these tumours are large, firm and fibrous, usually
unilateral masses.
Histologically, they are composed of spindle-shaped well-
differentiated fibroblasts and collagen. Sometimes,
combination of fibroma and thecoma is present called
fibrothecoma.
Sertoli-Leydig Cell Tumours
(Androblastoma, Arrhenoblastoma)
Tumours containing Sertoli and Leydig cells in varying
degree of maturation comprise Sertoli-Leydig cell tumours,
also called androblastomas or arrhenoblastomas. Charac-
teristically, they produce androgens and masculinise the
patient. Less often, they may elaborate oestrogen. Their peak
incidence is in 2nd to 3rd decades of life.
Grossly, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour resembles a granulosa-
theca cell tumour.
Histologically, these tumours recapitulate to some extent
the structure of the testis. Three histologic types are
distinguished:
1.
Well-differentiated androblastoma composed almost
entirely of Sertoli cells or Leydig cells forming well-defined
tubules.
2.
Tumours with intermediate differentiation have a biphasic
pattern with formation of solid sheets in which abortive
tubules are present.
3.
Poorly-differentiated or sarcomatoid variety is composed
of spindle cells resembling sarcoma with interspersed
scanty Leydig cells.
Gynandroblastoma
Gynandroblastoma is an extremely rare tumour in which
there is combination of patterns of both granulosa-theca cell
tumour and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour. The term
gynandroblastoma stands for combination of female (gyn)
and male (andro).
IV. MISCELLANEOUS TUMOURS
LIPID CELL TUMOURS. There is a small group of ovarian
tumours that appears as soft yellow or yellow-brown nodules
which on histologic examination are composed of large lipid-

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
laden cells. These cells resemble Leydig, lutein and adrenal
cortical cells. The examples of these tumours are: hilus cell
tumours, adrenal rest tumours and luteomas. These tumours
elaborate steroid hormones and are responsible for various
endocrine dysfunctions such as Cushing’s syndrome and
virilisation.
GONADOBLASTOMA. This is a rare tumour occurring
exclusively in dysgenetic gonads, more often in phenotypic
females and in hermaphrodites. Dysfunctions include
virilism, amenorrhoea and abnormal external genitalia.
Microscopically, gonadoblastoma is composed of mixture
of germ cell and sex cord components.
V. METASTATIC TUMOURS
About 10% of ovarian cancers are secondary carcinomas.
Metastasis may occur by lymphatic or haematogenous route
but direct extension from adjacent organs (e.g. uterus,
fallopian tube and sigmoid colon) too occurs frequently.
Bilaterality of the tumour is the most helpful clue to diagnosis
of metastatic tumour. Most common primary sites from
where metastases to the ovaries are encountered are:
carcinomas of the breast, genital tract, gastrointestinal tract
(e.g. stomach, colon appendix, pancreas, biliary tract) and
haematopoietic malignancies.
Krukenberg Tumour
Krukenberg tumour is a distinctive bilateral tumour meta-
static to the ovaries by transcoelomic spread. The tumour is
generally secondary to a gastric carcinoma (page 557) but
other primary sites where mucinous carcinomas occur (e.g.
colon, appendix and breast) may also produce Krukenberg
tumour in the ovary. Rarely, a tumour having the pattern of
Krukenberg tumour is primary in the ovary.
Grossly, Krukenberg tumour forms rounded or kidney-
shaped firm large masses in both ovaries. Cut section
shows grey-white to yellow firm fleshy tumour and may
have areas of haemorrhage and necrosis (Fig. 24.32).
Microscopically, it is characterised by the presence of
mucus-filled signet ring cells which may lie singly or in
clusters. It is accompanied by sarcoma-like cellular prolife-
ration of ovarian stroma (Fig. 24.33).
FIGO staging of ovarian cancer is given in Table 24.7.

CHAPTER 24
The Female Genital Tract
PLACENTA
NORMAL STRUCTURE
At term, the normal placenta is blue red, rounded, flattened
and discoid organ 15-20 cm in diameter and 2-4 cm thick. It
weighs 400-600 gm or about one-sixth the weight of the
newborn. The umbilical cord is about 50 cm long and
contains two umbilical arteries and one umbilical vein
attached at the foetal surface. The placenta is derived from
both maternal and foetal tissues. The maternal portion of the
placenta has irregular grooves dividing it into cotyledons
which are composed of sheets of decidua basalis and
remnants of blood vessels. The foetal portion of the placenta
is composed of numerous functional units called chorionic
villi and comprise the major part of placenta at term. The
villi consist of a loose fibrovascular stromal core and a few
phagocytic (Höffbauer’s) cells. The villous core is covered
by an inner layer of cytotrophoblast and outer layer of
syncytiotrophoblast. The basement membrane separating
the foetal capillaries in the villous core and the trophoblast
forms zones where nutrients and metabolites are
transported between the mother and the foetus. Such zones
are called vasculosyncitial membranes. The placenta
secretes a number of hormones and enzymes into the
maternal blood. These include: human chorionic gonado-
tropin (hCG), human placental lactogen (HPL), chorionic
thyrotropin and adrenocorticotropin hormone which
partake in oestrogen and progesterone metabolism.
Diseases related to pregnancy and placenta are numerous
and form the subject matter of discussion in obstetrics.
Certain conditions such as inflammation of the placenta and
chorionic membranes (placentitis and chorioamnionitis),
placental abnormalities (e.g. placenta accreta, placenta
praevia and twin placenta etc), toxaemia of pregnancy
(eclampsia and pre-eclampsia) and products of gestation seen
in abortions need mere mention only here. However,
gestational trophoblastic diseases resulting from benign
and malignant overgrowth of trophoblast—hydatidiform
mole (complete and partial mole) and choriocarcinoma
respectively, are significant morphologic lessions and are
discussed below and their features contrasted in Table 24.8.
HYDATIDIFORM MOLE
The word ‘hydatidiform’ means drop of water and ‘mole’ for
a shapeless mass. Hydatidiform mole is defined as an abnormal
placenta characterised by 2 features:
i) Enlarged, oedematous and hydropic change of the
chorionic villi which become vesicular.
ii) Variable amount of trophoblastic proliferation.
Most workers consider hydatidiform mole as a benign
tumour of placental tissue with potential for developing into
choriocarcinoma, while some authors have described mole
as a degenerative lesion though capable of neoplastic change.
The incidence of molar pregnancy is high in teenagers and
in older women. For unknown reasons, frequency of
hydatidiform mole varies in different regions of the world;
the incidence in Asia and Central America is about 10 times
higher than in the United States. The incidence is higher in
poorer classes.
Hydatidiform mole may be non-invasive or invasive. Two
types of non-invasive moles are distinguished—complete
(classic) and partial. Pathogenesis of these 2 forms is different:
Complete (classic) mole by cytogenetic studies has been
shown to be derived from the father (androgenesis) and has
46, XX or rarely 46, XY chromosomal pattern. Complete mole
bears relationship to choriocarcinoma.
Partial mole is mostly triploid (i.e. 69,XXY or 69,XXX)
and rarely tetraploid. Partial mole rarely develops into
choriocarcinoma.
Clinically, the condition appears in 4th-5th month of
gestation and is characterised by increase in uterine size,
vaginal bleeding and often with symptoms of toxaemia.
Frequently, there is history of passage of grape-like masses
per vaginum. About 1% of women with molar pregnancy
develop it again in a subsequent pregnancy.
The single most significant investigation forming the
mainstay of management is the serial determination of
β-hCG which is elevated more in both blood and urine as
compared with the levels in normal pregnancy. Removal of
the mole is accompanied by fall in β-hCG levels. A more
ominous behaviour is associated with no fall in β-hCG
levels after expulsion of the mole. About 10% of patients with
complete mole develop into invasive moles and 2.5% into
choriocarcinoma.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The pathologic findings
in non-invasive (complete and partial) and invasive mole
are different:

enlarged and characteristically filled with grape-like
vesicles up to 3 cm in diameter (Fig. 24.34). The vesicles
contain clear watery fluid. Rarely, a macerated foetus may
be found.
Microscopically, the features are quite typical. These are
as under (Fig. 24.35):

CHAPTER 24
The Female Genital Tract
PARTIAL MOLE. Grossly, the uterus is generally smaller
than expected and contains some cystic villi, while part
of the placenta appears normal. A foetus with multiple
malformations is often present.
Microscopically, some of the villi show oedematous
change while others are normal or even fibrotic.
Trophoblastic proliferation is usually slight and focal.
INVASIVE (DESTRUCTIVE) MOLE (CHORIO-
ADENOMA DESTRUENS). Grossly, invasive mole
shows invasion of the molar tissue into the uterine wall
which may be a source of haemorrhage. Rarely, molar
tissue may invade the blood vessels and reach the lungs.
Microscopically, the lesion is benign and identical to
classic mole but has potential for haemorrhage. It is always
associated with persistent elevation of β-hCG levels.
CHORIOCARCINOMA
Gestational choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant and
widely metastasising tumour of trophoblast (non-gestational
choriocarcinoma is described on page 748). Approximately
50% of cases occur following hydatidiform mole, 25%
following spontaneous abortion, 20% after an otherwise
normal pregnancy, and 5% develop in an ectopic pregnancy.
Choriocarcinoma follows the geographic pattern of
hydatidiform mole, being more common in Asia and Africa
than in the United States and Europe.
Clinically, the most common complaint is vaginal
bleeding following a normal or abnormal pregnancy.
Occasionally, the patients present with metastases in the

and sheets.
brain or lungs. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration
of persistently high levels of β-hCG in the plasma and urine.
Widespread haematogenous metastases are early and
frequent in choriocarcinoma if not treated; these are found
chiefly in the lungs, vagina, brain, liver and kidneys.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour
appears as haemorrhagic, soft and fleshy mass.
Sometimes, the tumour may be small, often like a blood
clot, in the uterus.
Microscopically, the characteristic features are as under:
Absence of identifiable villi.
Masses and columns of highly anaplastic and bizarre
cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast cells which are
intermixed.
Invariable presence of haemorrhages and necrosis.
Invasion of the underlying myometrium and other
structures, blood vessels and lymphatics.
Gestational choriocarcinoma and its metastases
respond very well to chemotherapy while non-gestational
choriocarcinoma is quite resistant to therapy and has
worse prognosis. With hysterectomy and chemotherapy,
the cure rate of choriocarcinoma has remarkably improved
from dismal 20 to 70% 5-year survival rate and almost total
cure in localised tumours. The effectiveness of treatment
is also monitored by serial β-hCG determinations. Death
from choriocarcinoma is generally due to fatal
haemorrhage in the CNS or lungs or from pulmonary
insufficiency.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
The Breast
Chapter 25
Chapter 25
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The breast is a modified skin appendage which is functional
in the females during lactation but is rudimentary in the
males. Microanatomy of the breast reveals 2 types of tissue
components: epithelial and stromal (Fig. 25.1). In a fully-
developed non-lactating female breast, the epithelial
component comprises less than 10% of the total volume but
is more significant pathologically since majority of lesions
pertain to this portion of the breast.
EPITHELIAL COMPONENT. The epithelial component of
the breast consists of 2 major parts: terminal duct-lobular
unit (TDLU) which performs the main secretory function
during lactation, and large duct system which performs the
function of collection and drainage of secretions; both are
interconnected to each other.
The breast is divided into about 20 lobes. Each lobe
consists of breast lobules which drain their secretions through
its collecting duct system and opens into the nipple through
its own main excretory duct, lactiferous duct. The segment of
lactiferous duct subjacent to the nipple shows a small
dilatation called lactiferous sinus. Each lactiferous duct has
its own collecting duct system which has branches of smaller
diameter, ultimately terminating peripherally as terminal
ducts (or TDLU) in the breast lobules.
The entire ductal-lobular epithelial system has bilayered
lining: the inner epithelium with secretory and absorptive
function, and an outer supporting myoepithelial lining, both
having characteristic ultrastructure and immunoreativity.
The inner epithelium stains positive for epithelial membrane
antigen (EMA) and lactalbumin while the myoepithelium is
positive for smooth muscle actin (SMA) and S-100.
STROMAL COMPONENT. The supportive stroma of the
breast consists of variable amount of loose connective tissue
and adipose tissue during different stages of reproductive
life. The stromal tissue of the breast is present at 2 locations:
intralobular and interlobular stroma. Intralobular stroma
encloses each lobule, and its acini and ducts, and is chiefly
made of loose connective tissue, myxomatous stroma and a
few scattered lymphocytes. Interlobular stroma separates one

The Breast
lobule from the other and is composed mainly of adipose
tissue and some loose connective tissue.
The most important disease of the breast is cancer.
However, there are a few inflammatory lesions, benign
tumours and tumour-like lesions which may be confused
clinically with breast cancer. These pathologic lesions are
described first, followed by an account of breast cancer.
NON-NEOPLASTIC CONDITIONS
These conditions in the breast include inflammations,
fibrocystic change and gynaecomastia.
INFLAMMATIONS
Inflammation of the breast is called mastitis. Important types
of mastitis are acute mastitis and breast abscess, chronic
mastitis, mammary duct ectasia (or plasma cell mastitis),
traumatic fat necrosis and galactocele.
Acute Mastitis and Breast Abscess
Acute pyogenic infection of the breast occurs chiefly during
the first few weeks of lactation and sometimes by eczema
of the nipples. Bacteria such as staphylococci and
streptococci gain entry into the breast by development of
cracks and fissures in the nipple. Initially a localised area
of acute inflammation is produced which, if not effectively
treated, may cause single or multiple breast abscesses.
Extensive necrosis and replacement by fibrous scarring of
the breast with retraction of the nipple may result.
Granulomatous Mastitis
Although chronic non-specific mastitis is uncommon, chronic
granulomatous inflammation in the breast may occur as a
result of the following:
1.
Systemic non-infectious granulomatous disease e.g. as part
of systemic  sarcoidosis, Wegener’s granulomatosis.
2.
Infections e.g. tuberculosis which is not so uncommon in
developing countries like India and may be misdiagnosed
clinically as breast cancer owing to axillary nodal
involvement. Tubercle bacilli reach the breast by haemato-
genous, lymphatic or direct spread, usually from the lungs
or pleura. Pathologically, typical caseating tubercles with
discharging sinuses through the surface of the breast are
found. ZN staining may demonstrate acid-fast bacilli. Fungal
infection of the breast may occur in immunocompromised
patients.
3.
Silicone breast implants implanted on breast cancer patients
after mastectomy or as breast augmentation cosmetic surgery
may rupture or silicone may slowly leak into surrounding
breast tissue. This incites chronic inflammatory reaction of
lymphocytes, macrophages and foreign body giant cells.
Eventually, a surrounding fibrous capsule forms and after a
long period it may even be calcified.
4.
Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis is an uncommon form of
reaction around lobules and ducts in the absence of any
known etiology. Exact pathogenesis is not known but
probably it is a form of hypersensitivity reaction to luminal
secretion of the breast epithelium during lactation.
Mammary Duct Ectasia (Plasma Cell Mastitis)
Mammary duct ectasia is a condition in which one or more
of the larger ducts of the breast are dilated and filled with
inspissated secretions. These are associated with periductal
and interstitial chronic inflammatory changes. Duct ectasia
affects women in their 4th to 7th decades of life. The patients
may remain asymptomatic or there may be nipple
discharge, retraction of the nipple due to fibrous scarring
and clinically palpable dilated ducts in the subareolar area.
The lesion may be mistaken for carcinoma of the breast.
The etiology of the condition remains unknown but it
appears to begin with periductal inflammation followed by
destruction of the elastic tissue to cause ectasia and
periductal fibrosis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the condition
appears as a single, poorly-defined indurated area in the
breast with ropiness on the surface. Cut section shows
dilated ducts containing cheesy inspissated secretions.
Histologically, the features are as under:
1.
Dilated ducts with either necrotic or atrophic lining
by flattened epithelium and lumen containing granular,
amorphous, pink debris and foam cells.
2.
Periductal and interstitial chronic inflammation,
chiefly lymphocytes, histiocytes with multinucleate histio-
cytic giant cells. Sometimes, plasma cells are present in
impressive numbers and the condition is then termed
plasma cell mastitis.
3.
Occasionally, there may be obliteration of the ducts
by fibrous tissue and varying amount of inflammation and
is termed obliterative mastitis.
Fat Necrosis
Focal fat necrosis of an obese and pendulous breast followed
by an inflammatory reaction is generally initiated by
trauma. The condition presents as a well-defined mass with
indurated appearance.
Grossly, the excised lump has central pale cystic area of
necrosis.
Histologically, there is disruption of the regular pattern
of lipocytes with formation of lipid-filled spaces
surrounded by neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells
and histiocytes having foamy cytoplasm and frequent
foreign body giant cell formation. In late stage, there is
replacement fibrosis and even calcification.
Galactocele
A galactocele is cystic dilatation of one or more ducts
occurring during lactation. The mammary duct is obstruc-
ted and dilated to form a thin-walled cyst filled with milky
fluid. Rarely, the wall of galactocele may get secondarily
infected.
FIBROCYSTIC CHANGE
Fibrocystic change is the most common benign breast
condition producing vague ‘lumpy’ breast rather than

756
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
palpable lump in the breast. Its incidence has been reported
to range from 10-20% in adult women, most often between
3rd and 5th decades of life, with dramatic decline in its
incidence after menopause suggesting the role of oestrogen
in its pathogenesis. It was previously termed fibrocystic disease
but is currently considered as an exaggerated physiologic
phenomena and not a disease. The entity was formerly also
known as benign mammary dysplasia under the mistaken belief
that all forms are dysplastic or  precancerous conditions, and
hence has attracted considerable interest.
As such, fibrocystic change of the female breast  is a
histologic entity characterised by following features:
i)
Cystic dilatation of terminal ducts.
ii) Relative increase in inter- and intralobular fibrous tissue.
iii) Variable degree of epithelial proliferation in the terminal
ducts.
It is important to identify the spectrum of histologic
features by core needle biopsy or cytologic findings by FNAC
in fibrocystic changes since only some subset of changes has
an increased risk of development of breast cancer. Presently,
the spectrum of histologic changes are divided into two
clinicopathologically relevant groups:
A. Nonproliferative changes: Simple fibrocystic change.
B. Proliferative changes: Proliferative fibrocystic change.
A. Nonproliferative Fibrocystic Changes:
Simple Fibrocystic Change
Simple fibrocystic change most commonly includes
2 features—formation of cysts of varying size, and increase
in fibrous stroma. Cysts are formed by dilatation of
obstructed collecting ducts, obstruction being caused by
periductal fibrosis following inflammation or fibrous
overgrowth from oestrogen stimulation.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the cysts are
rarely solitary but are usually multifocal and bilateral.
They vary from microcysts to 5-6 cm in diameter. The
usual large cyst is rounded, translucent with bluish colour
prior to opening (blue-dome cyst). On opening, the cyst
contains thin serous to haemorrhagic fluid.
Microscopically, simple fibrocystic change includes
following 2 features (Fig. 25.2):
1.
Cyst formation: The cyst lining shows a variety of
appearances. Often, the epithelium is flattened or atrophic.
Frequently, there is apocrine change or apocrine meta-
plasia in the lining of the cyst resembling the cells of
apocrine sweat glands. Occasionally, there is simultaneous
epithelial hyperplasia (discussed below) forming tiny
intracystic papillary projections of piled up epithelium.
2.
Fibrosis: There is increased fibrous stroma surround-
ing the cysts and variable degree of stromal lymphocytic
infiltrate.
B. Proliferative Fibrocystic Changes;
Epithelial Hyperplasia and Sclerosing Adenosis
Proliferative fibrocystic change in the breasts includes 2
entities: epithelial hyperplasia and sclerosing adenosis.
EPITHELIAL HYPERPLASIA. Epithelial hyperplasia (or
epitheliosis in the British literature) is defined as increase
in the layers of epithelial cells over the basement membrane
to three or more layers in the ducts (ductal hyperplasia) or
lobules (lobular hyperplasia). The latter condition, lobular
hyperplasia, must be distinguished from adenosis
(discussed separately) in which there is increase in the
number of ductules or acini without any change in the
number or type of cells lining them. Epithelial hyperplasia
may be totally benign or may have atypical features. It is
the latter type of hyperplasia which is precancerous and is
associated with increased risk of developing breast cancer.
Microscopically, epithelial hyperplasia is characterised by
epithelial proliferation to more than its normal double
layer. In general, ductal hyperplasia is termed as epithelial
Figure 25.2

epithelial hyperplasia in terminal ducts. B, Non-proliferative fibrocystic changes—fibrosis, cyst formation, adenosis and apocrine metaplasia.

CHAPTER 25
The Breast
hyperplasia of usual type and may show various grades of
epithelial proliferations (mild, moderate and atypical) as
under, while lobular hyperplasia involving the ductules or
acini is always atypical:
1.
Mild hyperplasia of ductal epithelium consists of at
least three layers of cells above the basement membrane,
present focally or evenly throughout the duct.
2.
Moderate and florid hyperplasia of ductal type is
associated with tendency to fill the ductal lumen with
proliferated epithelium. Such epithelial proliferations into
the lumina of ducts may be focal, forming papillary
epithelial projections called ductal papillomatosis, or may
be more extensive, termed florid papillomatosis, or may fill
the ductal lumen leaving only small fenestrations in it.
3.
Of all the ductal hyperplasias, atypical ductal hyper-
plasia is more ominous and has to be distinguished from
intraductal carcinoma (page 760). The proliferated
epithelial cells in the atypical ductal hyperplasia partially
fill the duct lumen and produce irregular microglandular
spaces or cribriform pattern. The individual cells are
uniform in shape but show loss of polarity with indistinct
cytoplasmic margin and slightly elongated nuclei.
4.
Atypical lobular hyperplasia is closely related to
lobular carcinoma in situ (page 761) but differs from the
latter in having cytologically atypical cells only in half of
the ductules or acini.
SCLEROSING ADENOSIS.  Sclerosing adenosis is benign
proliferation of small ductules or acini and intralobular
fibrosis. The lesion may be present as diffusely scattered
microscopic foci in the breast parenchyma, or may form an
isolated palpable mass which may simulate an infiltrating
carcinoma, both clinically and pathologically.
Grossly, the lesion may be coexistent with other
components of fibrocystic disease, or may form an isolated
mass which has hard cartilage-like consistency,
resembling an infiltrating carcinoma.
Microscopically, there is proliferation of ductules or acini
and fibrous stromal overgrowth. The histologic
appearance may superficially resemble infiltrating
carcinoma but differs from the latter in having maintained
lobular pattern and lack of infiltration into the surrounding
fat.
Prognostic Significance
Since there is a variable degree of involvement of epithelial
and mesenchymal elements in fibrocystic change, following
prognostic implications may occur:
1. Simple fibrocystic change or nonproliferative fibrocystic changes
of fibrosis and cyst formation do not carry any increased risk
of developing invasive breast cancer.
2.  Identification of general proliferative fibrocystic changes are
associated with 1.5 to 2 times increased risk for development
of invasive breast cancer.
3. Multifocal and bilateral proliferative changes in the breast pose
increased risk to both the breasts equally.
4. Within the group of proliferative fibrocystic changes,
atypical hyperplasia in particular, carries 4 to 5 times increased
risk to develop invasive breast cancer later. This risk is further
more if there is a history of breast cancer in the family.
GYNAECOMASTIA (HYPERTROPHY OF MALE BREAST)
Unilateral or bilateral enlargement of the male breast is
known as gynaecomastia. Since the male breast does not
contain secretory lobules, the enlargement is mainly due to
proliferation of ducts and increased periductal stroma.
Gynaecomastia occurs in response to hormonal stimulation,
mainly oestrogen. Such excessive oestrogenic activity in
males is seen in young boys between 13 and 17 years of age
(pubertal gynaecomastia), in men over 50 years (senescent
gynaecomastia), in endocrine diseases associated with
increased oestrogenic or decreased androgenic activity e.g.
in hepatic cirrhosis, testicular tumours, pituitary tumours,
carcinoma of the lung, exogenous oestrogen therapy as in
carcinoma of the prostate and testicular atrophy in
Klinefelter’s syndrome (secondary gynaecomastia); and lastly,
enlargement without any obvious cause (idiopathic gynaeco-
mastia).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, one or both the
male breasts are enlarged having smooth glistening white
tissue.
Microscopically, there are 2 main features:
1.
Proliferation of branching ducts which display
epithelial hyperplasia with formation of papillary
projections at places.
2.
Increased fibrous stroma with, myxoid appearance.
BREAST  TUMOURS
Tumours of the female breast are common and clinically
significant but are rare in men. Among the important benign
breast tumours are fibroadenoma, phyllodes tumour
(cystosarcoma phyllodes) and intraductal papilloma.
Carcinoma of the breast is an important malignant tumour
which occurs as non-invasive (carcinoma in situ) and invasive
cancer with its various morphologic varieties.
FIBROADENOMA
Fibroadenoma or adenofibroma is a benign tumour of fibrous
and epithelial elements. It is the most common benign
tumour of the female breast. Though it can occur at any age
during reproductive life, most patients are between 15 to 30
years of age. Clinically, fibroadenoma generally appears as
a solitary, discrete, freely mobile nodule within the breast.
Rarely, fibroadenoma may contain in situ or invasive lobular
or ductal carcinoma, or the carcinoma may invade the
fibroadenoma from the adjacent primary breast cancer.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, typical fibro-
adenoma is a small (2-4 cm diameter), solitary, well-
encapsulated, spherical or discoid mass. The cut surface
is firm, grey-white, slightly myxoid and may show slit-
like spaces formed by compressed ducts. Occasionally,
multiple fibroadenomas may form part of fibrocystic
disease and is termed fibroadenomatosis. Less commonly,

758
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
a fibroadenoma may be fairly large in size, up to 15 cm in
diameter, and is called giant fibroadenoma but lacks the
histologic features of cystosarcoma phyllodes (see below).
Microscopically, fibrous tissue comprises most of a
fibroadenoma. The arrangements between fibrous
overgrowth and ducts may produce two types of patterns
which may coexist in the same tumour. These are
intracanalicular and pericanalicular patterns (Fig. 25.3):
Intracanalicular pattern is one in which the stroma
compresses the ducts so that they are reduced to slit-like
clefts lined by ductal epithelium or may appear as cords
of epithelial elements surrounding masses of fibrous
stroma.
Pericanalicular pattern is characterised by encircling
masses of fibrous stroma around the patent or dilated
ducts.
The fibrous stroma may be quite cellular, or there may
be areas of hyalinised collagen. Sometimes, the stroma is
loose and myxomatous. Occasionally, the fibrous tissue
element in the tumour is scanty, and the tumour is instead
predominantly composed of closely-packed ductular or
acinar proliferation and is termed tubular adenoma. If
an adenoma is composed of acini with secretory activity,
it is called lactating adenoma seen during pregnancy or
lactation. Juvenile fibroadenoma is an uncommon variant
of fibroadenoma which is larger and rapidly growing mass
seen in adolescent girls but fortunately does not recur after
excision.
PHYLLODES TUMOUR (CYSTOSARCOMA PHYLLODES)
Cystosarcoma phyllodes was the nomenclature given by
Müller in 1838 to an uncommon bulky breast tumour with
leaf-like gross appearance (phyllodes=leaf-like) having an
aggressive clinical behaviour. Most patients are between 30
to 70 years of age. Grossly, the tumour resembles a giant
fibroadenoma but is distinguished histologically from the
latter by more cellular connective tissue. Later, the WHO
classification of breast tumours has proposed the term
‘phyllodes tumour’ in place of misleading term of ‘cysto-
sarcoma phyllodes’. Phyllodes tumour can be classified into
benign, borderline and malignant on the basis of histologic
features. Local recurrences are much more frequent than
metastases.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
generally large, 10-15 cm in diameter, round to oval,
bosselated, and less fully encapsulated than a fibro-
adenoma. The cut surface is grey-white with cystic
cavities, areas of haemorrhages, necrosis and degenerative
changes (Fig. 25.4).
Histologically, the phyllodes tumour is composed of an
extremely hypercellular stroma, accompanied by
proliferation of benign ductal structures. Thus, phyllodes
tumour resembles fibroadenoma except for enhanced
stromal cellularity. The histologic criteria used to
distinguish benign, borderline and malignant categories
of phyllodes tumour are as under:
frequency of mitoses;
cellular atypia;
cellularity; and
infiltrative margins.

white, firm, nodular mass having slit-like, compressed cystic areas (arrow)
and areas of haemorrhage.

759
CHAPTER 25
The Breast
About 20% of phyllodes tumours are histologically
malignant and less than half of them may metastasise.
INTRADUCTAL PAPILLOMA
Intraductal papilloma is a benign papillary tumour occurring
most commonly in a lactiferous duct or lactiferous sinus near
the nipple. Clinically, it produces serous or serosanguineous
nipple discharge. It is most common in 3rd and 4th decades
of life.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, intraductal papil-
loma is usually solitary, small, less than 1 cm in diameter,
commonly located in the major mammary ducts close to
the nipple. Less commonly, there are multiple
papillomatosis which are more frequently related to a
papillary carcinoma.
Histologically, an intraductal papilloma is characterised
by multiple papillae having well-developed fibrovascular
stalks attached to the ductal wall and covered by benign
cuboidal epithelial cells supported by myoepithelial cells.
An intraductal papillary carcinoma is distinguished from
intraductal papilloma in having severe cytologic atypia,
pleomorphism, absence of myoepithelial cells, multi-
layering and presence of mitotic figures.
CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST
Cancer of the breast is among the commonest of human
cancers throughout the world. Its incidence varies in different
countries but is particularly high in developed countries. In
the United States, carcinoma of the breast constitutes about
25% of all cancers in females and causes approximately 20%
of cancer deaths among females. However, there has been
some decline in mortality from the breast cancer in recent
years in North America, Western Europe and Australia due
to both early diagnosis and modern therapy. Cancer of the
male breast, on the other hand, is quite rare and comprises
0.2% of malignant tumours (ratio between male-female breast
cancer is 1:100). The incidence of breast cancer is highest in
the perimenopausal age group and is uncommon before the
age of 25 years.
Clinically, the breast cancer usually presents as a solitary,
painless, palpable lump which is detected quite often by self-
examination. Higher the age, more are the chances of breast
lump turning out to be malignant. Thus, all breast lumps,
irrespective of the age of the patient must be removed
surgically. Currently, emphasis is on early diagnosis by
mammography, xero-radiography and thermography.
Techniques like fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC),
stereotactic biopsy and frozen section are immensely valuable
to the surgeon for immediate pathological diagnosis.
Etiology
Though extensive clinical and experimental research as well
as epidemiologic studies have been carried out in the field
of breast cancer, its exact etiology remains elusive. However,
based on current status of our knowledge, the following risk
factors are considered significant in its etiology:
1.
Geography. The incidence of breast cancer is about six
times higher in developed countries than the developing
countries, with the notable exception of Japan. These
geographic differences are considered to be related to
consumption of large amount of animal fats and high caloric
diet by Western populations than the Asians (including
Japanese) and Africans.
2.
Genetic factors. Recently, much work has been done on
the influence of family history and inherited mutations in
breast cancer:
i)
Family history: First-degree relatives (mother, sister,
daughter) of women with breast cancer have 2 to 6-fold
higher risk of development of breast cancer. The risk is
proportionate to a few factors:
Number of blood relatives with breast cancer.
Younger age at the time of development of breast cancer.
Bilateral cancers.
High risk cancer families having breast and ovarian
carcinomas.
ii) Genetic mutations: About 10% breast cancers have been
found to have inherited mutations. These mutations include
the following, most important of which is breast cancer
(BRCA) susceptibility gene in inherited breast cancer:
BRCA 1 gene located on chromosome 17, a DNA repair
gene, is implicated in both breast and ovarian cancer in
inherited cases. BRCA1 deletion is seen in about two-third
of women with inherited breast cancer having family history
but BRCA1 mutation is uncommon in sporadic cases. The
protein product of BRCA gene is a cell cycle regulated protein
and it can be detected by  immunohistochemistry. Men who
have mutated BRCA1 have increased risk of developing
cancer of the prostate but not of male breast.
BRCA 2 gene located on chromosome 13, another DNA
repair gene, in its mutated form, has a similarly higher
incidence of inherited cancer of the breast (one-third cases)
and ovary in females, and prostate in men.
In both BRCA1 and BRCA2, both copies of the genes
(homozygous state) must be inactivated for development of
breast cancer.
Mutation in p53 tumour suppressor gene on chromosome
17 as an acquired defect accounts for 40% cases of sporadic
breast cancer in women but rarely in women with family
history of breast cancer. p53 mutation is also seen in Li-
Fraumeni syndrome having multiple cancers including
breast cancer in young women; others are tumours of the
brain, sarcomas, and adrenal cortical tumours.
Other mutations seen less frequently in breast cancer
include ataxia telangiectasia gene, PTEN (phosphate and
tensin) tumour suppressor gene.
3.
Oestrogen excess. There is sufficient evidence to suggest
that excess endogenous oestrogen or exogenously
administered oestrogen for prolonged duration is an
important factor in the development of breast cancer.
Evidences in support of increased risk with oestrogen excess
are as follows:
i)
Women with prolonged reproductive life, with menar-
che setting in at an early age and menopause relatively late
have greater risk.
ii) Higher risk in unmarried and nulliparous women than
in married and multiparous women.

760
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
iii) Women with first childbirth at a late age (over 30 years)
are at greater risk.
iv) Lactation is said to reduce the risk of breast cancer.
v) Bilateral oophorectomy reduces the risk of development
of breast cancer.
vi) Functioning ovarian tumours (e.g. granulosa cell tumour)
which elaborate oestrogen are associated with increased
incidence of breast cancer.
vii) Oestrogen replacement therapy administered to post-
menopausal women may result in increased risk of breast
cancer.
viii) Long-term use of oral contraceptives has been suspected
to predispose to breast cancer but there is no definite
increased risk with balanced oestrogen-progesterone
preparations used in oral contraceptives.
ix) Men who have been treated with oestrogen for prostatic
cancer have increased risk of developing cancer of the male
breast.
Normal breast epithelium possesses oestrogen and
progesterone receptors. The breast cancer cells secrete many
growth factors which are oestrogen-dependent. In this way,
the interplay of high circulating levels of oestrogen, oestrogen
receptors and growth factors brings about progression of
breast cancer.
4. Miscellaneous factors. These include a host of following
environmental influences and dietary factors associated with
increased risk of breast cancer:
i)
Consumption of large amounts of animal fats, high calorie
foods.
ii) Cigarette smoking.
iii) Alcohol consumption.
iv) Breast augmentation surgery.
v) Exposure to ionising radiation during breast
developement.
vi) Identification of a transmissible retrovirus in early 20th
century, mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV), also called
Bittner milk factor transmitted from the infected mother-mice
to the breast-fed daughter-mice prompted researchers to look
for similar agent in human breast cancer (Chapter 8). Though
no such agent has yet been identified, there are reports of
presence of reverse transcriptase in breast cancer cells.
5.
Fibrocystic change. Fibrocystic change, particularly
when associated with atypical epithelial hyperplasia, has
about 5-fold higher risk of developing breast cancer
subsequently.
General Features and Classification
Cancer of the breast occurs more often in left breast than
the right and is bilateral in about 4% cases. Anatomically,
upper outer quadrant is the site of tumour in half the breast
cancers; followed in frequency by central portion, and
equally in the remaining both lower and the upper inner
quadrant as shown in Fig. 25.5.
Carcinoma of the breast arises from the ductal epithelium
in 90% cases while the remaining 10% originate from the
lobular epithelium. For variable period of time, the tumour
cells remain confined within the ducts or lobules (non-
invasive carcinoma) before they invade the breast stroma
(invasive carcinoma). While only 2 types of non-invasive
carcinoma have been described—intraductal carcinoma and
lobular carcinoma in situ, there is a great variety of
histological patterns of invasive carcinoma breast which have
clinical correlations and prognostic implications. Table 25.1
presents different types of carcinoma of the breast as
proposed in the WHO classification with some modifications.
The important morphological forms are described below.
A. NON-INVASIVE (IN SITU) BREAST CARCINOMA
In general, two types of non-invasive or in situ carcinoma—
intraductal carcinoma and lobular carcinoma in situ, are
characterised histologically by presence of tumour cells
within the ducts or lobules respectively without evidence of
invasion.
Intraductal Carcinoma
Carcinoma in situ confined within the larger mammary ducts
is called intraductal carcinoma. The tumour initially begins
with atypical hyperplasia of ductal epithelium followed by
filling of the duct with tumour cells. Clinically, it produces a
palpable mass in 30-75% of cases and presence of nipple
discharge in about 30% patients. Approximately a quarter

CHAPTER 25
The Breast
of patients of intraductal carcinoma treated with excisional
biopsy alone develop ipsilateral invasive carcinoma during
a follow-up period of 10 years while the chance of a
contralateral breast cancer developing in patients with
intraductal carcinoma is far less than that associated with in
situ lobular carcinoma.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour may
vary from a small poorly-defined focus to 3-5 cm diameter
mass. On cut section, the involved area shows cystically
dilated ducts containing cheesy necrotic material (in
comedo pattern), or the intraductal tumour may be polypoid
and friable resembling intraductal papilloma (in papillary
pattern).
Histologically, the proliferating tumour cells within the
ductal lumina may have 4 types of patterns in different
combinations: solid, comedo, papillary and cribriform
(Fig. 25.6,A):
i)
Solid pattern is characterised by filling and plugging
of the ductal lumina with tumour cells.
ii) Comedo pattern is centrally placed necrotic debris
surrounded by neoplastic cells in the duct.
iii) Papillary pattern has formation of intraductal papillary
projections of tumour cells which lack a fibrovascular stalk
so as to distinguish it from intraductal papilloma.
iv) Cribriform pattern is recognised by neat punched out
fenestrations in the intraductal tumour.
Lobular Carcinoma in Situ
Lobular carcinoma in situ is not a palpable or grossly visible
tumour. Patients of in situ lobular carcinoma treated with
excisional biopsy alone develop invasive cancer of the
ipsilateral breast in about 25% cases in 10 years as in
intraductal carcinoma but, in addition, have a much higher
incidence of developing a contralateral breast cancer (30%).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, no visible tumour
is identified.
Histologically, in situ lobular carcinoma is characterised
by filling up of terminal ducts and ductules or acini by
rather uniform cells which are loosely cohesive and have
small, rounded nuclei with indistinct cytoplasmic margins
(Fig. 25.6,B).
B. INVASIVE BREAST CARCINOMA
Infiltrating (Invasive) Duct Carcinoma-NOS
Infiltrating duct carcinoma-NOS (not otherwise specified) is the
classic breast cancer and is the most common histologic
pattern accounting for 70% cases of breast cancer. In fact,
this is the pattern of cancer for which the terms ‘cancer’ and
‘carcinoma’ were first coined by Hippocrates. Clinically,
majority of infiltrating duct carcinomas have a hard
consistency due to dense collagenous stroma (scirrhous

carcinoma). They are found more frequently in the left breast,
often in the upper outer quadrant. Retraction of the nipple
and attachment of the tumour to underlying chest wall may
be present.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
irregular, 1-5 cm in diameter, hard cartilage-like mass that
cuts with a grating sound. The sectioned surface of the
tumour is grey-white to yellowish with chalky streaks and
often extends irregularly into the surrounding fat
(Fig. 25.7).
Histologically, as the name NOS suggests, the tumour is
different from other special types in lacking a regular and
uniform pattern throughout the lesion. A variety of
histologic features commonly present are as under
(Fig. 25.8):
i)
Anaplastic tumour cells forming solid nests, cords,
poorly-formed glandular structures and some intraductal
foci.
ii) Infiltration by these patterns of tumour cells into
diffuse fibrous stroma and fat.
iii) Invasion into perivascular and perineural spaces as
well as lymphatic and vascular invasion.
Infiltrating (Invasive) Lobular Carcinoma
Invasive lobular carcinoma comprises about 5% of all breast
cancers. This peculiar morphologic form differs from other
invasive cancers in being more frequently bilateral; and
within the same breast, it may have multicentric origin.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the appearance
varies from a well-defined scirrhous mass to a poorly-
defined area of induration that may remain undetected
by inspection as well as palpation.
Histologically, there are 2 distinct features (Fig. 25.9):
i)
Pattern—A characteristic single file (Indian file) linear
arrangement of stromal infiltration by the tumour cells
Figure 25.8
Infiltrating duct carcinoma-NOS. Microscopic features include formation of solid nests, cords, gland-like structures and intraductal
growth pattern of anaplastic tumour cells. There is infiltration of densely collagenised stroma by these cells in a haphazard manner.

Invasive lobular carcinoma. Characteristic histologic features are: one cell wide files of round regular tumour cells (‘Indian file’
arrangement) infiltrating the stroma and arranged circumferentially around ducts in a target-like pattern.

763
CHAPTER 25
The Breast
with very little tendency to gland formation is seen.
Infiltrating cells may be arranged concentrically around
ducts in a target-like pattern.
ii) Tumour cytology—Individual tumour cells resemble
cells of in situ lobular carcinoma. They are round and
regular with very little pleomorphism and infrequent
mitoses. Some tumours may show signet-ring cells
distended with cytoplasmic mucin.
Medullary Carcinoma
Medullary carcinoma is a variant of ductal carcinoma and
comprises about 1% of all breast cancers. The tumour has a
significantly better prognosis than the usual infiltrating duct
carcinoma, probably due to good host immune response in
the form of lymphoid infiltrate in the tumour stroma.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
characterised by a large, well-circumscribed, rounded
mass that is typically soft and fleshy or brain-like and
hence the alternative name of ‘encephaloid carcinoma’.
Cut section shows areas of haemorrhages and necrosis
(Fig. 25.10).
Histologically, medullary carcinoma is characterised by
2 distinct features (Fig. 25.11):
i)
Tumour cells—Sheets of large, pleomorphic tumour
cells with abundant cytoplasm, large vesicular nuclei and
many bizarre and atypical mitoses are diffusely spread in
the scanty stroma.
ii) Stroma—The loose connective tissue stroma is scanty
and usually has a prominent lymphoid infiltrate.
Colloid (Mucinous) Carcinoma
This is an uncommon pattern of breast cancer occurring more
frequently in older women and is slow-growing. Colloid
carcinoma has better prognosis than the usual infiltrating
duct carcinoma.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
usually a soft and gelatinous mass with well-demarcated
borders.
Histologically, colloid carcinoma contains large amount
of extracellular epithelial mucin and acini filled with
mucin. Cuboidal to tall columnar tumour cells, some
showing mucus vacuolation, are seen floating in large
lakes of mucin (Fig. 25.12).
Other Morphologic Forms
A few other morphologic forms of invasive breast carcinoma
having clinical significance have been recognised:
PAPILLARY CARCINOMA. It is a rare variety of infiltrating
duct carcinoma in which the stromal invasion is in the form
of papillary structures.
1. TUBULAR CARCINOMA. Tubular carcinoma is an
uncommon variant of invasive ductal carcinoma which has
more favourable prognosis.
Histologically, the tumour is highly well-differentiated
and has an orderly pattern. The tumour cells are regular
and form a single layer in well-defined tubules. The
tubules are quite even and distributed in dense fibrous
stroma.
2. ADENOID CYSTIC CARCINOMA. Adenoid cystic or
invasive cribriform carcinoma is a unique histologic pattern
of breast cancer with excellent prognosis.
Histologically, there is stromal invasion by islands of cells
having characteristic cribriform (fenestrated) appearance.
Figure 25.10
Medullary carcinoma breast. Cut surface of the breast
shows a large grey white soft fleshy tumour replacing almost whole of
the breast. The tumour is somewhat delineated from the adjacent breast
parenchyma (arrow) as compared to irregular margin of IDC.
Figure 25.11
Medullary carcinoma breast. Microscopy shows two
characteristic features—large tumour cells forming syncytial arrangement
and stroma infiltrated richly with lymphocytes.

764
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
3.
SECRETORY (JUVENILE) CARCINOMA. This pattern
is found more frequently in children and has a better
prognosis. The tumour is generally circumscribed which
on histologic examination shows abundant intra- and
extracellular PAS-positive clear spaces due to secretory
activity of tumour cells.
4.
INFLAMMATORY CARCINOMA. Inflammatory
carcinoma of the breast is a clinical entity and does not
constitute a histological type. The term has been used for
breast cancers in which there is redness, oedema, tenderness
and rapid enlargement. Inflammatory carcinoma is
associated with extensive invasion of dermal lymphatics and
has a dismal prognosis.
5.
METAPLASTIC CARCINOMA. Rarely, invasive
ductal carcinomas may have various types of metaplastic
alterations such as squamous metaplasia, cartilagenous and
osseous metaplasia, or their combinations. Development of
squamous cell carcinoma of the breast parenchyma is
exceedingly rare and must be separated from lesions of
epidermis or nipple region.
C. PAGET’S DISEASE OF THE NIPPLE
Paget’s disease of the nipple is an eczematoid lesion of the
nipple, often associated with an invasive or non-invasive
ductal carcinoma of the underlying breast. The nipple bears
a crusted, scaly and eczematoid lesion with a palpable
subareolar mass in about half the cases. Most of the patients
with palpable mass are found to have infiltrating duct
carcinoma, while those with no palpable breast lump are
usually subsequently found to have intraductal carcinoma.
Prognosis of patients with ductal carcinoma having Paget’s
disease is less favourable than of those who have ductal
carcinoma without Paget’s disease.
The pathogenesis of Paget’s disease of the breast is
explained by the following 2 hypotheses:
1.
The tumour cells from the underlying ductal carcinoma
have migrated up into the lactiferous ducts and invaded the
epidermis producing skin lesions.
2.
An alternate theory, though less reliable than the former,
is that Paget’s disease represents a form of carcinoma in situ
of the epidermis itself.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the skin of the
nipple and areola is crusted, fissured and ulcerated with
oozing of serosanguineous fluid from the erosions
(Fig. 25.13, A).
Histologically, the skin lesion is characterised by the
presence of Paget’s cells singly or in small clusters in the
epidermis (Fig. 25.13, B). These cells are larger than the
Figure 25.12
Colloid (mucinous) carcinoma breast. The tumour cells
are seen as clusters floating in pools of abundant mucin.

and areola is crusted and ulcerated. B, There are clefts in the epidermal

CHAPTER 25
The Breast
epidermal cells, spherical, having hyperchromatic nuclei
with cytoplasmic halo that stains positively with
mucicarmine. In these respects, Paget’s cells are
adenocarcinoma-type cells. In addition, the underlying
breast contains invasive or non-invasive duct carcinoma
which shows no obvious direct invasion of the skin of
nipple.
GRADING, STAGING AND PROGNOSIS
Histologic grading and clinical staging of breast cancer
determines the management and clinical course in these
patients.
A. HISTOLOGIC GRADING. The breast cancers are
subdivided into various histologic grades depending upon
the following parameters:
1.
Histologic type of tumour. Based on classification descri-
bed in Table 25.1, various microscopic types of breast cancer
can be subdivided into 3 histologic grades:
i)
Non-metastasising—Intraductal and lobular carcinoma in
situ.
ii) Less commonly metastasising—Medullary, colloid, papi-
llary, tubular, adenoid cystic (invasive cribriform), and
secretory (juvenile) carcinomas.
iii) Commonly metastasising—Infiltrating duct, invasive
lobular, and inflammatory carcinomas.
2.
Microscopic grade. Widely used system for microscopic
grading of breast carcinoma is that of Nottingham
modification of the Bloom-Richardson system. It is based on
3 features:
i)
Tubule formation
ii) Nuclear pleomorphism
iii) Mitotic count.
3.
Tumour size. There is generally an inverse relationship
between diameter of primary breast cancer at the time of
mastectomy and long-term survival.
4.
Axillary lymph node metastasis. Survival rate is based
on the number and level of lymph nodes involved by
metastasis. More the number of regional lymph nodes
involved, worse is the survival rate. Involvement of the
lymph nodes from proximal to distal axilla (i.e. level I—
superficial axilla, to level III—deep axilla) is directly correlated
with the survival rate. In this regards, identification and
dissection of sentinel lymph node followed by its
histopathologic examination has attained immense
prognostic value (Sentinel lymph node is the first node in the
vicinity to receive drainage from primary cancer i.e. it stands
‘sentinel’ over the tumour).
5.
Oestrogen and progesterone receptors (ER/PR).
Oestrogen is known to promote the breast cancer. Presence
or absence of hormone receptors on the tumour cells can help
in predicting the response of breast cancer to endocrine
therapy (Fig. 25.14). Accordingly, patients with high levels
of ER and PR on breast tumour cells have a slightly better
prognosis. A recurrent tumour that is receptor-positive is
more likely to respond to anti-oestrogen therapy than one
that is receptor-negative.
Figure 25.14
Oestrogen and progesterone hormonal receptors (ER
and PR) in breast cancer. The tumour cells show nuclear positivity with
ER and PR antibody immunostains.
6. HER2/neu overexpression. HER2/neu (also called erbB2),
a member of the family of epidermal growth factors, is a
transmembrane protein having tyrosine kinase activity. It
can be detected by immunohistochemistry or by fluorescence
in situ hybridisation (FISH) and is considered as a good
predictive marker. An individual having overexpression of
HER2/neu by tumour cells is likely to respond higher dose of
herceptin therapy but is not related to other forms of
chemotherapy.
7.
DNA content. Tumour cell subpopulations with
aneuploid DNA content as evaluated by mitotic markers (e.g.
Ki-67) or by flow cytometry have a worse prognosis than
purely diploid tumours.
B. CLINICAL STAGING. The American Joint Committee
(AJC) on cancer staging has modified the TNM (primary
Tumour, Nodal, and distant Metastasis) staging proposed
by UICC (Union International for Control of Cancer) and is
shown in Table 25.2.
Spread of breast cancer to axillary lymph nodes occurs
early. Later, however, distant spread by lymphatic route to
internal mammary lymphatics, mediastinal lymph nodes,
supraclavicular lymph nodes, pleural lymph nodes and
pleural lymphatics may occur. Common sites for
haematogenous metastatic spread from breast cancer are the
TABLE 25.2: AJC Clinical Staging of Breast Cancer.

disease of the nipple without palpable lump)

lungs, liver, bones, adrenals, brain and ovaries. Breast is one
of the most suspected source of inapparent primary
carcinoma in women presenting with metastatic carcinoma.
C. PROGNOSTIC FACTORS IN BREAST CANCER.
Based on current knowledge gained by breast cancer
screening programmes in the West employing mammo-
graphy and stereotactic biopsy, various breast cancer risk
factors and prognostic factors have been described. These
prognostic factors are divided into following 3 groups:
1.
Potentially pre-malignant lesions. These conditions are
as under:
i)
Atypical ductal hyperplasia is associated with 4-5 times
increased risk than women of the same age. Such lesions are
commonest in the age group of 45-55 years.
ii) Clinging carcinoma is a related lesion in the duct but
different from carcinoma in situ and has lower risk of
progression to invasive cancer than in situ carcinoma.

2.
Breast carcinoma in situ. Following factors act as
determinants:
i)
Ductal carcinoma in situ (comedo and non-comedo
subtypes) is diagnosed on the basis of three histologic
features—nuclear grade, nuclear morphology and necrosis,
while lobular neoplasia includes full spectrum of changes of
lobular carcinoma in situ and atypical lobular hyperplasia.
Ductal carcinoma in situ is more important and demands
most attention. Comedo type of in situ carcinoma has higher
recurrence rate.
ii) Breast conservative therapy is used more frequently
nowadays in carcinoma in situ which requires consideration
of three factors for management: margins, extent of disease,
and biological markers. The biological markers such as p53 and

767
CHAPTER 25
The Breast
BCL-2 have low positivity in high-grade in situ ductal
carcinoma and likelihood of recurrences after conservative
surgery.
3.
Invasive breast cancer. Prognostic and predictive factors
for invasive breast cancer have been extensively studied by
univariate analysis (examining single factor separately) as
well as by multivariate analysis (comparing the value of
various factors included in a study). These can be broadly
divided into 3 groups:
1.
routine histopathology criteria;
2.
hormone receptor status; and
3.
biological indicators.
A summary combining all these factors is given in
Table 25.3.
Overall, taking the most important parameter of node-
positive or node-negative breast cancer, the prognosis
varies— localised form of breast cancer without axillary
lymph node involvement has a survival rate of 84% while
survival rate falls to 56% with nodal metastases.

Systemic Pathology
The Skin
Chapter 26
Chapter 26
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The skin or the integument is the external organ that protects
against mechanical trauma, UV light and infection. In
addition, the skin is concerned with thermoregulation,
conservation and excretion of fluid, sensory perception and,
of course, has aesthetic role for appearance of the indidivdual.
The histology of normal skin shows some variation in
different parts of the body. In general, it is composed of 2
layers, the epidermis and the dermis, which are separated
by an irregular border. Cone-shaped dermal papillae extend
upward into the epidermis forming peg-like rete ridges of the
epidermis. Fig. 26.1 presents a diagrammatic representation
of the main structures identifiable in a section of the normal
skin while Fig. 26.2 shows the various layers of the epidermis.
EPIDERMIS
The epidermis is composed of the following 5 layers from
base to the surface:
1.
Basal cell layer (stratum germinatum). The basal cell
layer consists of a single layer of keratinocytes that forms
the junction between the epidermis and dermis. The nuclei
of these cells are perpendicular to the epidermal basement
membrane. These are hyperchromatic and normally contain
a few mitoses indicating that the superficial epidermal layers
originate from the basal cell layer. These cells are interconnec-
ted with each other and with the overlying squamous cells
by desmosomes. Interspersed in the keratinocytes are
melanocytes, a type of dendritic cells, seen as every tenth cell
in the basal layer. These cells have small nuclei with clear
cytoplasm containing melanin pigment granules that
determines the appearance of an individual. They are always
positive with dopa reaction (page 40). The other type of
dendritic cells in the basal layer are Langerhans cells which
are bone marrow-derived cells of mononuclear-phagocyte
system.
2.
Prickle cell layer (Stratum spinosum, Stratum malpi-
ghii). This layer is composed of several layers of polygonal
prickle cells or squamous cells. The layers become flat as they
near the surface so that their long axis appears parallel to
the skin surface. These cells possess intercellular bridges or
tonofilaments. These intercellular cytoplasmic tonofilaments
contain PAS-positive material that is precursor of keratin.
3.
Granular cell layer (stratum granulosum). This layer
consists of 1 to 3 layers of flat cells containing keratohyaline
basophilic granules which are PAS-negative. Granular cell
layer is much thicker in palms and soles.
4.
Stratum lucidum. This layer is present exclusively in
palms and soles as a thin homogeneous, eosinophilic, non-
nucleate zone.
5.
Horny layer (Stratum corneum). The stratum corneum
is also normally devoid of nuclei and consists of eosinophilic
layers of keratin.

Main structures identified in a section of the normal
skin.
Figure 26.2
Different layers comprising the normal epidermis.

769
CHAPTER 26
The Skin
Intraepidermal nerve endings are present in the form of
Merkel cells which are touch receptors.
DERMIS
The dermis consists of 2 parts—the superficial pars papillaris
or papillary dermis, and the deeper pars reticularis or reticular
dermis. The dermis is composed of fibrocollagenic tissue
containing blood vessels, lymphatics and nerves. In the skin
of fingers, arteriovenous shunts or glomera are normally
present. The specialised nerve endings present at some sites
perform specific functions. These are as under:
Pacinian corpuscles concerned with pressure are present
in the deep layer of skin.
Meissner corpuscles are touch receptors, located in the
papillae of skin of palms, soles, tips of fingers and toes.
Ruffini corpuscles are cold receptors found in the external
genitalia.
End-bulbs of Krause are cold receptors found in the external
genitalia.
Besides these structures, the dermis contains cutaneous
appendages or adnexal structures. These are sweat glands,
sebaceous glands, hair follicles, arrectores pilorum and nails:
1.
SWEAT GLANDS. These are of 2 types—eccrine and
apocrine.
i)
Eccrine glands. They are present all over the skin but are
most numerous on the palms, soles and axillae. They are
coiled tubular glands lying deep in the dermis. Their ducts
pass through the epidermis on the surface of the skin as pores
via which they empty their secretion i.e. sweat. The glands
are lined by two main types of secretory cells: basal,
acidophilic, clear or chief cells, and the superficial, basophilic,
dark granular cells. The secretory cells are surrounded by
myoepithelial cells.
ii) Apocrine glands. Apocrine glands are encountered in
some areas only—in the axillae, in the anogenital region, in
the external ear as modified glands called ceruminous glands,
in the eyelids as Moll’s glands, and in the breast as mammary
glands. Apocrine glands are also tubular glands but have
larger lumina. Apocrine glands have a single layer of
secretory cells which contain acidophilic, PAS-positive,
prominent granular cytoplasm. The type of secretion in
apocrine glands is decapitation secretion as if the cytoplasm
of the secretory cells is pinched off (apo = off).
2.
SEBACEOUS (HOLOCRINE) GLANDS. Sebaceous
glands are found everywhere on the skin except on the palms
and soles. They are often found in association with hair but
can be seen in a few areas devoid of hair as modified
sebaceous glands such as in the external auditory meatus,
nipple and areola of male and female breast, labia minora,
prepuce, and meibomian glands of the eyelids. Sebaceous
glands are composed of lobules of sebaceous cells containing
small round nuclei and abundant fatty, network-like
cytoplasm.
3.
HAIR. The hair grows from the bottom of the follicle. It
has, therefore, an intracutaneous portion present in the hair
follicle and the shaft. The hair follicle consists of epithelial
and connective tissue components. The hair shaft is made
up of an outer sheath and pigmented cortex and inner
medulla.
4.
ARRECTORES PILORI. These are small bundles of
smooth muscle attached to each hair follicle. When the muscle
contracts, the hair becomes more erect, the follicle is dragged
upwards so as to become prominent on the surface of the
skin producing what is known as ‘goose skin’.
5.
NAILS. The nails are thickenings of the deeper part of
the stratum corneum that develop at specially modified
portion of the skin called nail bed. The nail is composed of
clear horny cells, resembling stratum lucidum but are much
more keratinised.
HISTOPATHOLOGIC  TERMS
Before describing pathology of common skin diseases, the
following pathologic terms in common use need to be defined
for understanding of dermatopathology:
Acanthosis: Thickening of the epidermis due to hyperplasia
of stratum malpighii.
Acantholysis: Loss of cohesion between epidermal cells with
formation of intraepidermal space containing oedema fluid
and detached epithelial cells.
Dyskeratosis: Abnormal development of epidermal cells
resulting in rounded cells devoid of their prickles and having
pyknotic nuclei. Dyskeratosis is a feature of premalignant
and malignant lesions and is rarely seen in benign conditions.
Hyperkeratosis: Thickening of the horny layer.
Parakeratosis: Abnormal keratinisation of the cells so that
the horny layer contains nucleated keratinocytes rather than
the normal non-nucleate keratin layer.
Spongiosis: Intercellular oedema of the epidermis which may
progress to vesicle formation in the epidermis.
Pigment incontinence: Loss of melanin pigment from dama-
ged basal cell layer so that the pigment accumulates in the
melanophages in the dermis.
DERMATOSES
Dermatosis is a common term used for any skin disorder.
Dermatosis may be of various types such as genetic,
inflammatory, infectious, granulomatous, connective tissue,
bullous and scaling type. A few common examples of each
of these groups are described below.
I. GENETIC DERMATOSES
1.
ICHTHYOSIS. Two important forms of ichthyosis are—
ichthyosis vulgaris and sex-linked ichthyosis.
Ichthyosis vulgaris is an autosomal dominant disorder.
It is more common and appears a few months after birth as
scaly lesions on the extensor surfaces of the extremities.
Histologically, the characteristic feature is association of
hyperkeratosis with thin or absent granular layer.

770
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Sex-linked ichthyosis is a sex-(X) linked recessive
disorder. It begins shortly after birth and affects extensor as
well as flexor surfaces but palms and hands are spared.
Histologically, there is hyperkeratosis with normal or
thickened granular cell layer and acanthosis.
2.
KERATOSIS PALMARIS ET PLANTARIS. The
condition occurs as both autosomal dominant and autosomal
recessive forms. It mainly affects the palms and soles as
localised or diffuse lesions.
Histologically, there is marked hyperkeratosis, hyper-
granulosis, acanthosis and mild inflammatory infiltrate
in the upper dermis.
3.
XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM. This is an autosomal
recessive disorder in which sun-exposed skin is more
vulnerable to damage. The condition results from decreased
ability to repair the sunlight-induced damage to DNA.
Patients of xeroderma pigmentosum are more prone to
develop various skin cancers like squamous cell carcinoma,
basal cell carcinoma and melanocarcinoma.
Histologically, the changes include hyperkeratosis,
thinning and atrophy of stratum malpighii, chronic
inflammatory cell infiltrate in the dermis and irregular
accumulation of melanin in the basal cell layer. Changes
of skin cancers mentioned above may be present in
advanced stage.
4.
DARIER’S DISEASE (KERATOSIS FOLLICULARIS).
The condition is either transmitted as autosomal dominant
disorder or as a mutation. In typical cases, there is extensive
papular eruption.
Histologically, the characteristic changes are hyper-
keratosis, papillomatosis and dyskeratosis. Dyskeratosis
results in the formation of ‘corps ronds’ (present in the
granular layer as a central homogeneous basophilic
dyskeratotic mass surrounded by a clear halo) and ‘grains’
(having grain-shaped elongated nuclei surrounded by
homogeneous dyskeratotic material) and there is
appearance of suprabasal clefts containing acantholytic
cells. The dermis often shows chronic inflammatory cell
infiltrate.
5.
URTICARIA PIGMENTOSA. Urticaria pigmentosa may
occur as congenital form or may appear without any family
history in the adolescents. Clinically, the condition presents
as extensive pigmented macules.
Histologically, the epidermis is normal except for an
increase in melanin pigmentation in the basal cell layer.
The characteristic feature is the presence of numerous
mast cells in the dermis.
6.
ATAXIA TELANGIECTASIA. An autosomal recessive
disorder, ataxia appears in infancy, while telangiectasia
appears in childhood. The lesions are located on the
conjunctivae, cheeks, ears and neck. These children are more
prone to develop infections, especially of lungs, and
lymphoma-leukaemia.
Histologically, the papillary dermis shows numerous
dilated blood vessels.
II. NON-INFECTIOUS INFLAMMATORY DERMATOSES
A very large number of skin diseases have acute or chronic
inflammation as a prominent feature. A few selected
examples of non-infectious acute and chronic inflammatory
dermatoses which have not been covered in other groups of
dermatoses are given below.
1.
DERMATITIS (ECZEMA). The pathologic term derma-
titis is synonymous with the clinical term eczema. Both refer
to inflammatory response to a variety of agents acting on
the skin from outside or from within the body such as
chemicals and drugs, hypersensitivity to various antigens
and haptens etc. Accordingly, clinical types such as contact
dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, drug-induced dermatitis,
photo-eczematous dermatitis and primary irritant dermatitis
are described. Many idiopathic varieties of skin disorders
such as pompholyx, seborrheic dermatitis, exfoliative
dermatitis (erythroderma) and neurodermatitis (lichen
simplex chronica) are also included under this heading. In
general, these conditions are clinically characterised by
itching, erythema with oedema, oozing and scaling.
However, irrespective of the clinical type of dermatitis, the
histopathologic picture is similar.
Histologically, dermatitis reaction may be acute, subacute
or chronic:
Acute dermatitis is characterised by considerable
spongiosis (intercellular oedema) that may lead to forma-
tion of intraepidermal vesicles or bullae. The vesicles and
bullae as well as the oedematous epidermis are permeated
by acute inflammatory cells. The upper dermis shows
congested blood vessels and mononuclear inflammatory
cell infiltrate, especially around the small blood vessels.
Subacute dermatitis may follow acute dermatitis.
Spongiosis and vesicles are smaller than in acute
dermatitis. The epidermis shows moderate acanthosis and
varying degree of parakeratosis in the horny layer with
formation of surface crusts containing degenerated
leucocytes, bacteria and fibrin. The dermis contains
perivascular mononuclear infiltrate. The classical example
of subacute dermatitis is nummular dermatitis.
Chronic dermatitis shows hyperkeratosis, parakera-
tosis and acanthosis with elongation of the rete ridges and
broadened dermal papillae. Vesicles are absent but slight
spongiosis may be present. The upper dermis shows
perivascular chronic inflammatory infiltrate and fibrosis
(Fig. 26.3). The most characteristic example of chronic
dermatitis is lichen simplex chronicus.
2.
URTICARIA. Urticaria or hives is the presence of
transient, recurrent, pruritic wheals (i.e. raised erythematous
areas of oedema). Hereditary angioneurotic oedema is an
uncommon variant of urticaria in which there is recurrent
oedema not only on the skin but also on the oral, laryngeal
and gastrointestinal mucosa (page 97).

771
CHAPTER 26
The Skin
Histologically, there is dermal oedema and a perivascular
mononuclear infiltrate. There is localised mast cell
degranulation by sensitisation with specific IgE antibodies
but no increase in dermal mast cells (c.f. mastocytosis in
which there is increase in dermal mast cells).
3.
MILIARIA. Miliaria is a condition in which there is
cutaneous retention of sweat due to obstruction of sweat
ducts. There are 2 types of miliaria: miliaria crystallina and
miliaria rubra.
Miliaria crystallina occurs when there is obstruction of
sweat duct within the stratum corneum. It occurs in areas of
the skin exposed to sun or may occur during a febrile illness.
Histologically, there are intracorneal or subcorneal
vesicles which are in continuity with underlying sweat
ducts.
Miliaria rubra occurs when there is obstruction of sweat
ducts within the deeper layers of the epidermis. It is seen
more often in areas of skin covered by clothes following
profuse sweating and the lesions are itchy.
Histologically, there are spongiotic vesicles in the stratum
malpighii similar to those seen in dermatitis. These
vesicles are in continuity with a sweat duct. Adjacent
dermis usually shows chronic inflammatory infiltrate.
4.
PANNICULITIS (ERYTHEMA NODOSUM AND
ERYTHEMA INDURATUM). Panniculitis is inflammation
of the subcutaneous fat. Panniculitis may be acute or chronic.
Generally, panniculitis appears as nodular lesions,
predominantly on the lower legs. The following types of
panniculitis are described:
Erythema nodosum, acute or chronic, is the most
common form. The lesions consist of tender red nodules, 1-5
cm in diameter, seen more often on the anterior surface of
the lower legs. Erythema nodosum is often found in
association with bacterial or fungal infections, drug intake,
inflammatory bowel disease and certain malignancies.
Erythema induratum is a less common variety. The
lesions are chronic, painless, slightly tender, recurrent and
found on the calves of lower legs.
Histologically, the early lesions show necrotising vascu-
litis involving the blood vessels in the deep dermis and
subcutis. In chronic stage, there is inflammatory infiltrate
consisting of lymphocytes, histiocytes and multinucleate
giant cells. The infiltrate is located in the septa separating
the lobules of fat.
5.
ACNE VULGARIS. Acne vulgaris is a very common
chronic inflammatory dermatosis found predominantly in
adolescents in both sexes. The lesions are seen more
commonly on the face, upper chest and upper back. The
appearance of lesions around puberty is related to
physiologic hormonal variations. The condition affects the
hair follicle, the opening of which is blocked by keratin
material resulting in formation of comedones. Comedones may
be open having central black appearance due to oxidation of
melanin called black heads, or they may be in closed follicles
referred to as white heads. A closed comedone may get infected
and result in pustular acne.
Histologically, a comedone consists of keratinised cells,
sebum and bacteria. The hair follicle containing a
comedone is surrounded by lymphocytic infiltrate in
papular acne, and neutrophilic infiltrate in pustular acne.
Sometimes, the wall of the distended follicle is disrupted
so that the contents escape into the dermis where they
may incite granulomatous reaction.
III. INFECTIOUS DERMATOSES
Microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses and fungi are
responsible for a large number of dermatoses. Some common
examples of each category are described below.
1.
IMPETIGO. Impetigo is a common superficial bacterial
infection caused by staphylococci and streptococci. The
condition may occur in children or in adults and more
commonly involves hands and face. The lesions appear as
vesico-pustules which may rupture and are followed by
characteristic yellowish crusts.
Histologically, the characteristic feature is the subcorneal
pustule which is a collection of neutrophils under the
stratum corneum. Often, a few acantholytic cells and
gram-positive bacteria are found within the pustule. The
upper dermis contains severe inflammatory reaction
composed of neutrophils and lymphoid cells.
2.
VERRUCAE (WARTS). Verrucae or warts are common
viral lesions of the skin. They are caused by human
papillomaviruses (HPV) that belong to papovavirus group,
a type of DNA oncogenic virus (page 224). More than
Figure 26.3
Chronic dermatitis (eczema). The epidermis shows
hyperkeratosis, acathosis and broadened papillae and spongiosis of the
epidermal layers. The dermis shows mild perivascular chronic
inflammatory cell infiltrate.

772
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
100 HPV types have been identified. But it must be
appreciated that various types of HPVs produce not only
different morphologic lesions but also have variable
oncogenic potential as summed up in Table 26.1. Infection
with HPV is acquired by direct contact or by autoinoculation.
Verrucae may undergo spontaneous regression in a few
months to 2 years, or may spread to other sites. Depending
upon the clinical appearance and location, they are classified
into different types described below.
i)
Verruca vulgaris is the most common human wart,
commonly caused by HPV-1 and 2. The lesions are often
multiple, less than 1 cm in size, circumscribed, firm, elevated
papules occurring more commonly on the dorsal surfaces of
hands and fingers.
ii) Verruca plana on the other hand, is flat or slightly
elevated wart, common on the face and dorsal surface of
hands and is usually associated with HPV-10.
iii) Verruca planatairs or plantar warts occur on the sole of
the foot and is caused by HPV-1. They are covered with a
thick callus. They may, therefore, resemble calluses or a
verrucous carcinoma.
iv) Epidermodysplasia verruciformis resembles verruca
plana but differs by having familial occurrence with
autosomal recessive inheritance. The genome of HPV types
5 and 8 have been found in some of these tumours. Epidermo-
dysplasia verruciformis is of special clinical significance as
it may undergo malignant change, usually into Bowen’s
disease, and occasionally into squamous cell carcinoma.
v) Condyloma acuminatum or venereal wart or anogeni-
tal wart occurs on the penis, on the vulva and around the
anus (page 714). They are commonly caused by HPV-6. The
lesions appear as soft, papillary, cauliflower-like mass that
may grow fairly large in size (giant condyloma acuminata).
In rare cases, transformation into verrucous carcinoma may
occur.
Histologically, prototype of verruca is common viral wart
having following features (Fig. 26.4):
i)
Papillomatosis (papillary folds).
ii) Acanthosis (hyperplasia of stratum malpighii
containing foci of vacuolated cells in the upper stratum
malpighii.
iii) Hyperkaratosis with parakeratosis.
iv) Clumped keratohyaline granules in the granular cells
in the valleys between adjacent papillae.
v) Elongation of rete ridges with their lower tips bent
inwards.
vi) Virus-infected epidermal cells contain prominent
vacuolation (koilocytosis) and keratohyaline granules of
intracytoplasmic keratin aggregates due to viral
cytopathic effects. These cells on electron microscopy
reveal numerous intranuclear viral particles.

CHAPTER 26
The Skin
3.
MOLLUSCUM CONTAGIOSUM. Molluscum conta-
giosum is a common self-limiting contagious lesion caused
by a poxvirus which is a DNA virus. It is more common in
children and young adults. Infection is acquired by direct
contact. Clinically, the lesions are often multiple, discrete,
waxy, papules, about 5 mm in diameter and are seen more
frequently on the face and trunk. In a fully-developed lesion,
small amount of paste-like material can be expressed on
pressing.
Histologically, typical lesion consists of sharply
circumscribed cup-like epidermal lesion growing down
into the dermis. The proliferating epidermal cells contain
the pathognomonic intracytoplasmic eosinophilic
inclusion bodies called molluscum bodies (Fig. 26.5). These
bodies contain numerous viral particles.
4.
VIRAL EXANTHEMATA. Viral exanthemata are a
group of contagious conditions in which the epidermal cells
are destroyed by replicating viruses causing eruption or rash.
There are predominantly two groups of viruses which may
cause exanthem. These are: the poxvirus group (e.g. smallpox
or variola, cowpox or vaccinia), and the herpesvirus group (e.g.
chickenpox or varicella, herpes zoster or shingles, herpes
simplex). Clinically, these conditions have different
presentations but the eruptive lesions may look alike and
are, therefore, considered together.
Variola (smallpox) has been globally eradicated since
1978. The route of infection is via upper respiratory tract or
mouth followed by viraemia and characteristic skin lesions.
Vaccinia (cowpox) is primarily a disease of the teats and
udders of cows but humans are infected by milking the
infected animals. Varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster
(shingles) are both caused by a common virus, varicella-
zoster virus. Chickenpox is transmitted by the respiratory
route followed by viraemia and successive crops of lesions.
Herpes zoster is different manifestation of infection with the
same viral agent after years of latency. It is a disease of the
nerves and the tissues supplied by the nerves. The condition
is characterised by sharp burning pain, often dispropor-
tionate to the rash. Herpes simplex, caused by HSV-1, and
another related herpetic infection, herpes genitalis, caused
by HSV-2, are characterised by transmission by direct
physical contact and prolonged latency. The vesicular lesions
are often located on the skin, especially the facial skin around
lips and external nares; other sites are mucosal surfaces and
eyes.
Histologically, the characteristic feature of viral exan-
themata is the formation of intra-epidermal vesicles or
bullae due to cytopathic effects of viruses. In the early
stage, there is proliferation of epidermal cells and
formation of multinucleate giant cells. This is followed
by intracellular oedema and ballooning degeneration that
progresses on to rupture of the cells with eventual
formation of vesicles or bullae.
5.
SUPERFICIAL MYCOSES. Superficial fungal infections
of the skin are localised to stratum corneum (page 183). These
include some of the common dermatophytes such as
Trichophyton rubrum and Pityrosporum. Clinically, these fungal
infections are labelled according to the region involved. These
are as follows:
i)
Tinea capitis occurring on the scalp, especially in
children.
ii) Tinea barbae affecting the region of beard in adult males.
iii) Tinea corporis involving the body surface at all ages.
iv) Tinea cruris occurs most frequently in the region of groin
in obese men, especially in hot weather.
v) Tinea pedis or ‘athlete foot’ is located in the web spaces
between the toes.
vi) Onychomycosis shows disintegration of the nail
substance.
vii) Tinea versicolor caused by Malassezia furfur generally
affects the upper trunk.

Molluscum contagiosum. The epidermal layers show
numerous molluscum bodies which are intracytoplasmic inclusions. Inset
shows close-up view of molluscum bodies.
Figure 26.6
Tinea capitis in the skin. The stratum corneum around
the hair follicle shows presence of numerous arthrospores and hyphae.

774
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Histologically, fungal hyphae (or mycelia) and
arthrospores of dermatophytes are present in the stratum
corneum of skin, nails or hair. Hyphae may be septate or
nonseptate. Spores are round to oval bodies which grow
by budding. Special stains can be used to demonstrate
the fungi. These are: periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction
which stains the fungi deep pink to red (Fig. 26.6), and
methenamine silver nitrate method that stains fungi black.
IV.GRANULOMATOUS DISEASES
In many skin diseases, the host may respond by granu-
lomatous inflammation to a variety of microbial agents and
nonmicrobial material. Tuberculosis of the skin is the classical
example in which typical tubercles are formed; other
conditions are leprosy, syphilis, sarcoidosis, deep fungal
infection etc. These conditions have already been discussed
in Chapter 6. Nonmicrobial agents which can incite
granulomatous inflammation are keratin, hair, thorns, talc,
minerals like beryllium, asbestos and tattoo pigment etc.
Important representative examples of granulomatous
inflammation—lupus vulgaris, cutaneous sarcoidosis and
granuloma annulare, are described here.
1.
LUPUS VULGARIS. The lesions of lupus vulgaris, the
prototype of skin tuberculosis, are found most commonly
on the head and neck, especially skin of the nose. They are
yellowish-brown to reddish-brown tiny nodules (apple-jelly
nodules).
Histologically, the nodules consist of well-defined
tubercles lying in the upper dermis. They consist of
accumulation of epithelioid cells surrounded by lymphoid
cells. Caseation necrosis may be slight or absent.
Langhans’ and foreign body type of giant cells are often
present (Fig. 26.7). The condition needs to be distinguished
from sarcoidosis of the skin (vide infra). Tubercle bacilli
are present in very small numbers that are hard to
demonstrate by acid-fast staining.
2.
CUTANEOUS SARCOIDOSIS. Sarcoidosis is a systemic
granulomatous disease of unknown etiology (page 164). The
lesions appear in the lungs, skin, eyes, nose and lymph nodes.
Cutaneous manifestations appear as presenting feature in
about a quarter of patients and include erythema nodosum,
or brown-red jelly-like papules or plaques with central
clearing. When these lesions are seen around nose, eyes and
cheeks they are referred to as lupus perinio.
Microscopically, characteristic feature is the presence of
non-caseating epithelioid cell granulomas having
Langhans’ giant cells but having paucity of lymphocytes,
also called ‘naked granulomas’ (Fig. 26.8). Fibrinoid
necrosis and presence of intracellular inclusions such as
asteroid bodies are some other features which may be seen.
3.
GRANULOMA ANNULARE. The lesions of granuloma
annulare are often numerous. Dermal nodules are arranged
in a ring-like fashion, commonly on the hands and feet. The
condition appears to have correlation with diabetes mellitus.
Histologically, the centre of the lesion shows a well
demarcated focus of complete collagen degeneration.
These foci are surrounded by an infiltrate composed
largely of histiocytes and some mononuclear inflam-
matory cells forming a palisade arrangement and are
therefore also referred to as palisading granulomas.
V. CONNECTIVE  TISSUE DISEASES
Group of diseases caused by self-antigens or autoimmune
diseases are included under connective tissue diseases. A

epithelioid cell granulomas having giant cells and lymphocytes.
Figure 26.8
Cutaneous sarcoidosis. The dermis shows non-
caseating epithelioid granulomas having Langhans’ giant cells and paucity
of lymphocytes, termed as naked granulomas.

775
CHAPTER 26
The Skin
list of such diseases along with their etiology and patho-
genesis is given in Chapter 4. Morphology of skin lesions of
two important representative examples—lupus erythematosus
and systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), is given below. Another
connective tissue disease of unknown etiology, lichen
sclerosus et atrophicus, is also considered here.
1.
LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS. Two types of lupus
erythematosus are recognised—a chronic form, discoid lupus
erythematosus (DLE) which is confined to the skin; and a
systemic form, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that has
widespread visceral vascular lesions. The discoid variety is
more common which is generally benign, while systemic
form may be fatal, usually from renal involvement. The
diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical, serologic and
pathologic changes. The characteristic cutaneous lesions in
DLE consist of well-defined erythematous discoid patches
associated with scaling and atrophy and often limited to the
face. In contrast, cutaneous lesions in SLE are present only
in a small proportion of cases and consist of erythematous,
slightly oedematous patches which are without significant
scaling and without atrophy.
Histologically, cutaneous lesion in DLE and SLE may not
be distinguishable in all cases. The important features are
as follows (Fig. 26.9):
i)
Hyperkeratosis with keratotic plugging.
ii) Thinning and flattening of rete malpighii.
iii) Hydropic degeneration of basal layer.
iv) Patchy lymphoid infiltrate around cutaneous adnexal
structures.
v) Upper dermis showing oedema, vasodilatation and
extravasation of red cells.
Direct immunofluorescence reveals granular deposits of
immunoglobulins, most commonly IgG and IgM, and
components of complement on the basement membrane of
the affected skin in both DLE and SLE. High serum titres of
antinuclear antibodies and demonstration of LE cells (page
79) are other notable features, especially in SLE.
2. SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS (SCLERODERMA). Two
types of systemic sclerosis or scleroderma are identified: a
localised form called morphea, and a generalised form called
progressive systemic sclerosis. A variant of progressive
systemic sclerosis is CREST syndrome. (C = calcinosis,
R = Raynaud’s phenomenon, E = esophageal dismotility,
S = sclerodactyly and T = telangiectasia). Etiology and
pathogenesis of these conditions are already described
(page 80). Morphea consists of lesions limited to the skin
and subcutaneous tissue, while progressive systemic
sclerosis consists of extensive involvement of the skin and
the subcutaneous tissue and has visceral lesions too. The
lesions generally begin in the fingers and distal extremities
and then extend proximally to involve the arms, shoulders,
neck and face.
Histologically, there is thickening of the dermal collagen
extending into the subcutaneous tissue. There is
pronounced chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the affected
area. The epidermis is often thin, devoid of rete ridges
and adnexal structures, and there is hyalinised thickening
of the walls of dermal arterioles and capillaries.
Subcutaneous calcification may develop.
3.
LICHEN SCLEROSUS ET ATROPHICUS. This condi-
tion involves genital skin most frequently and is often the
only site of involvement. It occurs in both sexes, more
commonly in women than in men. It is termed kraurosis vulvae
in women while the counterpart in men is referred to as
balanitis xerotica obliterans. Occasionally, the condition may
coexist with morphea. Clinically, the condition may simulate
malignancy.
Histologically, the characteristic features are as under:
i)
Hyperkeratosis with follicular plugging.
ii) Thinning and atrophy of the epidermis.
iii) Hydropic degeneration of the basal layer.
iv) Upper dermis showing oedema and hyaline appear-
ance of collagen.
v) Inflammatory infiltrate in mid-dermis.
VI. NON-INFECTIOUS BULLOUS DERMATOSES
This is a group of skin diseases characterised by bullae and
vesicles. A bulla is a cavity formed in the layers of the skin
and containing blood, plasma, epidermal cells or
inflammatory cells, while a vesicle is a small bulla less than 5
mm in diameter. Blister is the common term used for both
bulla and vesicle. The blister can be located at different sites
such as subcorneal, intra-epidermal (suprabasal or
subcorneal) and subepidermal. These blisters can appear in
infectious as well as in noninfectious dermatoses. A few
common examples of noninfectious dermatoses are
pemphigus, pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis and
erythema multiforme and are illustrated in Fig. 26.10.
Figure 26.9
Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE). The epidermis is
flat and is devoid of rete ridges. There is hyperkeratosis and follicular
plugging. The basal layer shows hydropic degeneration and loss of dermo-
epidermal junction (arrow). The upper dermis is oedematous and shows
moderate lymphocytic infiltration.

776
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Histologically, superficial subcorneal bullae are found
which contain acantholytic epidermal cells.
iv) Pemphigus erythematosus is an early form of pemphigus
foliaceous. The distribution of clinical lesions is similar to
lupus erythematosus involving face.
Figure 26.10
Location of bullae and vesicles in non-infectious bullous dermatoses. A, Pemphigus vulgaris: The bulla is predominantly suprabasilar
in position and contains acantholytic cells. B, Pemphigus vegetans: An intraepidermal abscess composed of eosinophils is seen. C, Pemphigus
foliaceous: The bulla is superficial in subcorneal position and contains acantholytic cells. D, Pemphigoid: The bulla containing eosinophilis is
subepidermal with regeneration of the epidermis at the periphery. E, Dermatitis herpetiformis: There is a papillary microabscess composed of
neutrophils. F, Erythema Multiforme: The affected area shows necrotic keratinocytes and inflammatory cells.
1.
PEMPHIGUS. Pemphigus is an autoimmune bullous
disease of the skin and mucosa which has 4 clinical and
pathologic variants: pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus
vegetans, pemphigus foliaceous and pemphigus erythe-
matosus.
All forms of pemphigus have acantholysis as common
histologic feature. Sera from these patients contain IgG
antibodies to cement substance of skin and mucosa.
i)
Pemphigus vulgaris is the most common type
characterised by the development of flaccid bullae on the
skin and oral mucosa. These bullae break easily leaving
behind denuded surface.
Histologically, the bullae are suprabasal in location so
that the basal layer remains attached to dermis like a row
of tombstones. The bullous cavity contains serum and
acantholytic epidermal cells (Fig. 26.11).
ii) Pemphigus vegetans is an uncommon variant consisting
of early lesions resembling pemphigus vulgaris. But later,
verrucous vegetations are found on the skin and oral mucosa
instead of bullous lesions.
Histologically, there is considerable acanthosis and
papillomatosis. Intraepidermal abscesses composed
almost entirely of eosinophils are diagnostic of pemphigus
vegetans (Fig. 24.4,B).
iii) Pemphigus foliaceous is characterised by quite
superficial bullae which leave shallow zones of erythema and
crust.
Figure 26.11
Pemphigus vulgaris. An intraepidermal bulla in
suprabasal location containing acantholytic cells (arrow) is seen.

777
CHAPTER 26
The Skin
Histologically, the picture is identical to that of pemphi-
gus foliaceous.
2.
PEMPHIGOID. This is a form of bullous disease affecting
skin or the mucous membranes. Three variants have been
described—localised form occurring on the lower extremities;
vesicular form consisting of small tense blisters; and vegetating
form having verrucous vegetations found mainly in the axillae
and groins.
Histologically, the characteristic distinguishing feature
from pemphigus is the subepidermal location of the non-
acantholytic bullae. With passage of time, there is some
epidermal regeneration from the periphery at the floor of
the bulla. The bullous cavity contains fibrin network and
many mononuclear inflammatory cells and many
eosinophils (Fig. 26.12). Dermal changes seen in
inflammatory bullae consist of infiltrate of mononuclear
cells, a few eosinophils and neutrophils.
3.
DERMATITIS HERPETIFORMIS. Dermatitis herpeti-
formis is a form of chronic, pruritic, vesicular dermatosis.
The lesions are found more commonly in males in 3rd to 4th
decades of life. The disease has an association with gluten-
sensitive enteropathy (coeliac disease). Both dermatitis
herpetiformis and gluten-sensitive enteropathy respond to
a gluten-free diet. The pathogenesis of the disease is not quite
clear but probably individuals with certain histocompatibility
types develop IgA and IgG antibodies to gliadin which is a
fraction of gluten present in the flour (page 575).
Histologically, the early lesions of dermatitis herpeti-
formis consist of neutrophilic micro-abscesses at the tips
of papillae, producing separation or blister between the
papillary dermis and the epidermis (Fig. 26.13). The older
blisters contain fair number of eosinophils causing
confusion with bullous pemphigoid. Direct immuno-
fluorescence shows granular deposits of IgA at the
papillary tips in dermatitis herpetiformis.
4.
ERYTHEMA MULTIFORME. This is an acute, self-
limiting but recurrent dermatosis. The condition occurs due
to hypersensitivity to certain infections and drugs, and in
many cases, it is idiopathic. As the name suggests, the lesions
are multiform such as macular, papular, vesicular and bullous.
Quite often, the lesions have symmetric involvement of the
extremities. Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a severe, at times
fatal, form of involvement of skin and mucous membranes
of the mouth, conjunctivae, genital and perianal area.
Another variant termed toxic epidermal necrolysis consists of
diffuse necrosis of the epidermis and mucosa, exposing the
dermis giving the skin a scalded appearance.

Systemic Pathology
Histologically, the changes vary according to the clinical
multiform stage.
i)
Early lesions show oedema and lymphocytic infiltrate
at the dermoepidermal junction. The superfical dermis
shows perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate.
ii) Later stage is associated with migration of lymphocytes
upwards into the epidermis resulting in epidermal
necrosis and blister formation (Fig. 26.14).
VII. SCALING DERMATOSES
The skin surface in some chronic inflammatory dermatoses
is roughened due to excessive and abnormal scale formation
and desquamation. Common examples of this group are
psoriasis and lichen planus. Hereditary ichthyosis having
similar scaly lesions has already been described.
1.
PSORIASIS. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory derma-
tosis that affects about 2% of the population. It usually
appears first between the age of 15 and 30 years. The lesions
are characterised by brownish-red papules and plaques
which are sharply demarcated and are covered with fine,
silvery white scales. As the scales are removed by gentle
scrapping, fine bleeding points appear termed Auspitz sign.
Commonly involved sites are the scalp, upper back, sacral
region and extensor surfaces of the extremities, especially
the knees and elbows. In about 25% of cases, peculiar pitting
of nails is seen. Psoriatic arthritis resembling rheumatoid
arthritis is produced in about 5% of cases but rheumatoid
factor is absent.
Histologically, the following features are observed in
fully-developed lesions (Fig. 26.15):
i)
Acanthosis with regular downgrowth of rete ridges
to almost the same dermal level with thickening of their
lower portion.
ii) Elongation and oedema of the dermal papillae with
broadening of their tips.
iii) Suprapapillary thinning of stratum malpighii.
iv) Absence of granular cell layer.
v) Prominent parakeratosis.
vi) Presence of Munro microabscesses in the parakeratotic
horny layer is diagnostic of psoriasis.
2.
LICHEN PLANUS. Lichen planus is a chronic dermatosis
characterised clinically by irregular, violaceous, shining, flat-
topped, pruritic papules. The lesions are distributed
symmetrically with sites of predilection being flexor surfaces
of the wrists, forearms, legs and external genitalia. Buccal
mucosa is also involved in many cases of lichen planus.
Histologically, the characteristic features are as under
(Fig. 26.16):
i)
Marked hyperkeratosis.
ii) Focal hypergranulosis.
iii) Irregular acanthosis with elongated saw-toothed rete
ridges.
iv) Liquefactive degeneration of the basal layer.
v) A band-like dermal infiltrate of mononuclear cells,
sharply demarcated at its lower border and closely
hugging the basal layer.
VIII. METABOLIC DISEASES OF SKIN
Skin is involved in a variety of systemic metabolic derange-
ments. The examples include the following:
Figure 26.15
Psoriasis. There is regular elongation of the rete ridges with thickening of their lower portion. The papillae are elongated and
oedematous with suprapapillary thinning of epidermis. There is marked parakeratosis with diagnostic Munro microabscesses in the parakeratotic
layer.

Many of these conditions have been discussed elsewhere
in the book; calcinosis cutis is briefly considered below.
CALCINOSIS CUTIS. There are four types of calcification
in the skin:
i)
Metastatic calcinosis cutis
ii) Dystrophic calcinosis cutis
iii) Idiopathic calcinosis cutis
iv) Subepidermal calcified nodule
i)
Metastatic calcinosis cutis develops due to hypercal-
caemia or hyperphosphataemia as discussed on page 53.
ii) Dystrophic calcinosis cutis results when there is
deposition of calcium salts at damaged tissue.
iii) Idiopathic calcinosis cutis resembles dystrophic type but
is not associated with any underlying disease. A special
manifestation of idiopathic calcinosis cutis is tumoral calcinosis
in which there are large subcutaneous calcified masses, often
accompanied by foreign body giant cell reaction. Calcium
may discharge from the surface of the lesion. Idiopathic
calcinosis of the scrotum consists of multiple asymptomatic
nodules of the scrotal skin (Fig. 26.17).
iv) Subepidermal calcified nodule or cutaneous calculus is a
single raised hard calcified nodule in the upper dermis.
TUMOURS AND TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS
The skin is the largest organ of the body. Tumours and
tumour-like lesions may arise from different components of
the skin such as surface epidermis, epidermal appendages
and dermal tissues. Each of these tissues may give rise to
benign and malignant tumours as well as tumour-like lesions.
Besides these, there is a group of conditions and lesions which
are precancerous. Another group of tumours have their origin
Figure 26.16
Lichen planus. There is hyperkeratosis, focal hypergranulosis and irregular acanthosis with elongated saw-toothed rete ridges.
The basal layer shows liquefactive degeneration. The upper dermis shows a band-like mononuclear infiltrate with a sharply-demarcated lower
border.

from elsewhere in the body but are cellular migrants to the
skin. A comprehensive list of tumours and tumour-like
lesions of the skin is presented in Table 26.2. It is beyond the
scope of this book to describe all these tumours and lesions,
for which the interested reader may consult specialised work
on dermatopathology. Some important and common
examples of these conditions are considered here.
I. TUMOURS AND CYSTS OF THE EPIDERMIS
A. Benign Tumours
1.
SQUAMOUS PAPILLOMA. Squamous papilloma is a
benign epithelial tumour of the skin. Though considered by
many authors to include common viral warts (verrucae) and
condyloma acuminata, true squamous papillomas differ from
these viral lesions. If these ‘viral tumours’ are excluded,
squamous papilloma is a rare tumour.
Histologically, squamous papillomas are characterised by
hyperkeratosis, acanthosis with elongation of rete ridges
and papillomatosis (Fig. 26.18). The verrucae, in addition
to these features, have foci of vacuolated cells in the
acanthotic stratum malpighii, vertical tiers of
parakeratosis between the adjacent papillae and irregular
clumps of keratohyaline granules in the virus-infected
granular cells lying in the valleys between the papillae
(page 772) .
2.
SEBORRHEIC KERATOSIS. Seborrheic keratosis is a
very common lesion in middle-aged adults. There may be
only one lesion, but more often these are many. The common
locations are trunk and face. They are sharply-demarcated,
brownish, smooth-surfaced, measuring a few millimeters in
diameter.
Histologically, the pathognomonic feature is a sharply-
demarcated exophytic tumour overlying a straight line
from the normal epidermis at one end of the tumour to
the normal epidermis at the other end. The other features
are papillomatosis, hyperkeratosis and acanthosis as seen
in squamous cell papillomas (Fig. 26.19).
3.
FIBROEPITHELIAL POLYPS. Also known by other
names such as ‘skin tags’, ‘acrochordons’ and ‘soft fibromas’,
these are the most common cutaneous lesions. They are often
multiple, soft, small (a few mm in size), bag-like tumours
commonly seen on the neck, trunk and axillae.
Histologically, the tumours are composed of loosely-
arranged fibrovascular cores with overlying hyperplastic
epidermis (Fig. 26.20).
B. Epithelial Cysts
Various cysts in the skin may arise from downward growth
of the epidermis and the appendages. These cysts often
contain paste-like pultaceous material containing keratin,
sebaceous secretions and lipid-containing debris. Depending
upon the structure of the cyst wall, these cysts are of various
types as under:

CHAPTER 26
The Skin
1.
EPIDERMAL CYST. These intradermal or subcutaneous
cysts, commonly called sebaceous cysts, are common and
may occur spontaneously or due to implantation of the
epidermis into the dermis or subcutis (implantation cysts).
Most frequent sites are the skin of face, scalp, neck and trunk.
Histologically, epidermal cysts have a cyst wall composed
of true epidermis with laminated layers of keratin
(Fig. 26.21). Rupture of the cyst may incite foreign body
giant cell inflammatory reaction in the wall.
2.
PILAR (TRICHILEMMAL, SEBACEOUS) CYST. These
cysts clinically resemble epidermal cysts but occur more
frequently on the scalp and are less common than the
epidermal cysts.
Histologically, the cyst wall is composed of palisading
squamous epithelial cells. These cells undergo degene-
ration towards the cyst cavity. Rupture of the cyst wall is
common and leads to foreign body giant cell inflammatory
reaction. Calcification in the cyst wall is often present.
3.
DERMOID CYST. These are subcutaneous cysts often
present since birth. Dermoid cysts are more common on the
face, along the lines of embryonic closure
Histologically, the cyst wall contains epidermis as well
as appendages such as hair follicles, sebaceous glands and
sweat glands (Fig. 26.22).

keratosis and acanthosis.

The epidermis is raised as polypoid mass over dense hyalinised fibrous
connective tissue in the dermis.

782
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
4.
STEATOCYSTOMA MULTIPLEX. This is an inherited
autosomal dominant disorder having multiple cystic nodules,
1-3 cm in size. They are more common in the axillae, sternum
and arms.
Histologically, the cyst walls are composed of several
layers of epithelial cells and contain lobules of sebaceous
glands in the cyst wall.
C. Pre-malignant Lesions
1.
SOLAR KERATOSIS (ACTINIC KERATOSIS, SENILE
KERATOSIS). Solar (sun-induced) or actinic (induced by a
variety of rays) keratoses are the multiple lesions occurring
in sun-exposed areas of the skin in fair-skinned elderly
people. Similar lesions may be induced by exposure to
ionising radiation, hydrocarbons and arsenicals. The
condition is considered to be a forerunner of invasive
squamous cell and/or basal cell carcinoma. Clinically, the
lesions are tan-brown, erythematous, about 1 cm in diameter
with rough, sandpaper-like surface and are seen more
commonly on the dorsum of the hands and on the balded
portion of the skin.
Histologically, solar keratoses are squamous cell
carcinoma in situ with the following characteristic features:
i)
Considerable hyperkeratosis.
ii) Marked acanthosis.
iii) Dyskeratosis and dysplasia of the epidermal cells
showing features such as hyperchromatism, loss of
polarity, pleomorphism and increased number of mitotic
figures.
iv) Non-specific chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate in the
upper dermis encroaching upon the basement membrane
of the epidermis.
2.
BOWEN’S DISEASE. Bowen’s disease is also a
carcinoma in situ of the entire epidermis but differs from solar
keratosis in having solitary lesion often that may occur on
sun-exposed as well as sun-unexposed skin. The condition
may occur anywhere on the skin but is found more often on
the trunk, buttocks and extremities. Clinically, the lesions of
Bowen’s disease are sharply circumscribed, rounded,
reddish-brown patches which enlarge slowly.
Histologically, the characteristic features are as under
(Fig. 26.23):
i)
Marked hyperkeratosis.
Figure 26.21
Epidermal inclusion cyst. The cyst wall is composed
of all layers of the epidermis and has laminated layers of keratin towards
the lumen of the cyst.
Figure 26.22
Dermoid cyst. In addition to features of epidermal
cyst, dermoid cyst has adnexal structures in the cyst wall (i.e. hair follicles,
sweat and sebaceous glands).
Figure 26.23
Bowen’s disease. The epidermis is thick with loss of
rete ridges but the normal base to surface maturation of epidermal layers
is effaced. Instead, there are bizarre atypical squamous cells but the
border between the epidermis and dermis is intact i.e. the basement
membrane is not breached.

783
CHAPTER 26
The Skin
ii) Pronounced parakeratosis.
iii) Marked epidermal hyperplasia with disappearance of
dermal papillae.
iv) Scattered bizarre dyskeratotic cells distributed
throughout the epidermis.
Bowen’s disease, unlike solar keratosis which invariably
leads to invasive cancer, may remain confined to the surface
for many years.
3.
XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM. This condition is a
hypersensitivity of the skin to sunlight that is determined
by a recessive gene. The disorder may lead to multiple
malignancies of the skin such as basal cell carcinoma,
squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma.
Xeroderma pigmentosum has already been described under
genetic dermatoses.
D. Malignant Tumours
1.
SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA. Squamous cell
carcinoma may arise on any part of the skin and mucous
membranes lined by squamous epithelium but is more likely
to occur on sun-exposed parts in older people. Various
predisposing conditions include the following:
i)
Xeroderma pigmentosum
ii) Solar keratosis
iii) Chronic inflammatory conditions such as chronic ulcers
and draining osteomyelitis
iv) Old burn scars (Marjolin’s ulcers)
v) Chemical burns
vi) Psoriasis
vii) HIV infection
viii) Ionising radiation
ix) Industrial carcinogens (coal tars, oils etc)
x) In the case of cancer of oral cavity, chewing betel nuts
and tobacco.
Cancer of scrotal skin in chimney-sweeps was the first
cancer in which an occupational carcinogen (soot) was impli-
cated. ‘Kangari cancer’ of the skin of inner side of thigh and
lower abdomen common in natives of Kashmir is another
example of skin cancer due to chronic irritation (Kangari is
an earthenware pot containing glowing charcoal used by
Kashmiris close to their abdomen to keep them warm).
Although squamous carcinomas can occur anywhere on
the skin, most common locations are the face, pinna of the
ears, back of hands and mucocutaneous junctions such as
on the lips, anal canal and glans penis. Cutaneous squamous
carcinoma arising in a pre-existing inflammatory and
degenerative lesion has a higher incidence of developing
metastases.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, squamous
carcinoma of the skin and squamous-lined mucosa can
have one of the following two patterns (Fig. 26.24):
i)
More commonly, an ulcerated growth with elevated and
indurated margin is seen.
ii) Less often, a raised fungating or polypoid verrucous
lesion without ulceration is found.
Microscopically, squamous cell carcinoma is an invasive
carcinoma of the surface epidermis characterised by the
following features (Fig. 26.25):
i)
There is irregular downward proliferation of
epidermal cells into the dermis.
ii) Depending upon the grade of malignancy, the masses
of epidermal cells show atypical features such as variation
in cell size and shape, nuclear hyperchromatism, absence
of intercellular bridges, individual cell keratinisation and
occurrence of atypical mitotic figures.
iii) Better-differentiated squamous carcinomas have
whorled arrangement of malignant squamous cells

patterns showing ulcerated and fungating polypoid growth. B, The skin
surface on the sole of the foot shows a fungating and ulcerated growth.
On cutting, the growth is both exophytic and endophytic and is chalky
white in colour.

784
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
forming horn pearls. The centres of these horn pearls may
contain laminated, keratin material.
iv) Higher grades of squamous carcinomas, however,
have fewer or no horn pearls and may instead have highly
atypical cells.
v) An uncommon variant of squamous carcinoma may
have spindle-shaped tumour cells (spindle cell carcinoma).
vi) Adenoid changes may be seen in a portion of squa-
mous cell carcinoma (adenoid squamous cell carcinoma).
vii) Verrucous carcinoma is a low-grade squamous cell
carcinoma in which the superficial portion of the tumour
resembles verruca (hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis,
acanthosis and papillomatosis) but differs from it in
having downward proliferation into deeper portion of the
tumour.
viii) All variants of squamous cell carcinoma show inflam-
matory reaction between the collections of tumour cells,
while in pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia there is permea-
tion of the epithelial proliferations by inflammatory cells.
A system of grading of squamous cell carcinoma called
Broders’ grading has been proposed that depends upon the
percentage of anaplastic cells present in a tumour (page 204).
Accordingly, following 4 grades are recognised:
Grade I
:
Less than 25% anaplastic cells
Grade II
:
25-50% anaplastic cells
Grade III
:
50-75% anaplastic cells
Grade IV
:
More than 75% anaplastic cells.
However, it is important to take into account other factors
for grading the tumour such as: the degree of atypicality of
the tumour cells, presence or absence of keratinisation and
the depth of penetration of the lesion. Therefore, based on
combination of these factors, it is customary with pathologists
to label squamous cell carcinomas with descriptive terms
such as: well-differentiated, moderately-differentiated,
undifferentiated, keratinising, non-keratinising, spindle cell
type etc.
2.
BASAL CELL CARCINOMA (RODENT ULCER).
Typically, the basal cell carcinoma is a locally invasive, slow-
growing tumour of middle-aged that rarely metastasises. It
occurs exclusively on hairy skin, the most common location
(90%) being the face, usually above a line from the lobe of
the ear to the corner of the mouth (Fig. 26.26). Basal cell
carcinoma is seen more frequently in white-skinned people
and in those who have prolonged exposure to strong sunlight
like in those living in Australia and New Zealand (page 221).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the most
common pattern is a nodulo-ulcerative basal cell
carcinoma in which a slow-growing small nodule
undergoes central ulceration with pearly, rolled margins.
The tumour enlarges in size by burrowing and by
destroying the tissues locally like a rodent and hence the
Figure 26.25
Microscopic features of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The dermis is invaded by downward proliferating epidermal
masses of cells which show atypical features. A few horn pearls with central laminated keratin are present. There is inflammatory reaction in the
dermis between the masses of tumour cells.
Figure 26.26

basal cell carcinoma (rodent ulcer).

785
CHAPTER 26
The Skin
name ‘rodent ulcer’. However, less frequently non-
ulcerated nodular pattern, pigmented basal cell carcinoma
and fibrosing variants are also encountered.
Histologically, the most characteristic feature is the
proliferation of basaloid cells (resembling basal layer of
epidermis). A variety of patterns of these cells may be seen:
solid masses, masses of pigmented cells, strands and nests
of tumour cells in morphea pattern, keratotic masses,
cystic change with sebaceous differentiation, and adenoid
pattern with apocrine or eccrine differentiation. The most
common pattern is solid basal cell carcinoma in which the
dermis contains irregular masses of basaloid cells having
characteristic peripheral palisaded appearance of the
nuclei (Fig. 26.27). A superficial multicentric variant
composed of multiple foci of tumour cells present in the
dermis, especially in the trunk, has also been described.
3.
METATYPICAL CARCINOMA (BASOSQUAMOUS
CELL CARCINOMA). Metatypical or basosquamous cell
carcinoma is the term used for a tumour in which the cell
type and arrangement of cells cause difficulty in deciding
between basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.
The tumour masses are composed of malignant squamous
cells with horn pearls and the outer row of dark-staining basal
cells. These tumours have a high malignant potential and
may occasionally metastasise.
II. ADNEXAL (APPENDAGEAL) TUMOURS
Tumours arising from epidermal adnexa or appendages can
differentiate towards hair follicles, sebaceous glands and
sweat glands (apocrine and eccrine glands). Most of the
adnexal tumours are benign but a few malignant variants
also exist.
A. Tumours of Hair Follicle
These are uncommon benign tumours. Two important
examples are trichoepithelioma and pilomatricoma.
1.
TRICHOEPITHELIOMA (BROOKE’S TUMOUR). This
tumour may occur as a solitary lesion or as multiple inherited
lesions, predominantly on the face, scalp and neck.
Histologically, the tumour is often circumscribed. The
most characteristic histologic feature is the presence of
multiple horn cysts having keratinised centre and
surrounded by basophilic cells resembling basal cells.
These horn cysts simulate abortive pilar structures which
are interconnected by epithelial tracts.
2.
PILOMATRICOMA (CALCIFYING EPITHELIOMA
OF MALHERBE). Pilomatricoma usually occurs as a solitary
lesion, more often on the face and upper extremities. It may
be seen at any age. The lesions vary in size from 0.5-5 cm
and appear as well-demarcated dark red nodules.
Histologically, the circumscribed tumour is located in
deeper dermis and subcutis. The masses of tumour cells
embedded in cellular stroma characteristically consist of
2 types of cells: the peripheral basophilic cells resembling
hair matrix cells, and the inner shadow cells having central
unstained shadow in place of the lost nucleus. Areas of
calcification are present within lobules of shadow cells in
three-fourth of the tumours (Fig. 26.28).
B. Tumours of Sebaceous Glands
Tumours originating from sebaceous glands are commonly
benign (e.g. naevus sebaceus and sebaceous adenoma) but
sebaceous carcinoma may occasionally occur.
1.
NAEVUS SEBACEUS. Naevus sebaceus of Jadassohn
occurs mainly on the scalp or face as a solitary lesion that
may be present at birth. Initially, the lesion appears as a
hairless plaque, but later it becomes verrucous and nodular.
Histologically, naevus sebaceus is characterised by
hyperplasia of immature sebaceous glands and pilar
structures. The overlying epidermis shows papillary
acanthosis.
Figure 26.27
Solid basal cell carcinoma. The dermis is invaded by irregular masses of basaloid cells with characteristic peripheral palisaded
appearance. The masses of tumour cells are separated from dermal collagen by a space called shrinkage artefact.

786
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
2.
SEBACEOUS ADENOMA. Sebaceous adenoma occurs
in middle-aged persons, most commonly on the face.
Histologically, it is sharply demarcated from the
surrounding tissue. The tumour is composed of irregular
lobules of incompletely differentiated sebaceous glands.
3.
SEBACEOUS CARCINOMA. Sebaceous carcinoma is a
rare tumour that may occur anywhere in the body except
the palms and soles. Variants of sebaceous carcinoma are
carcinoma of the Meibomian glands of the eyelids (page 511)
and carcinoma of the ceruminous glands in the external
meatus.
Histologically, the tumour is composed of variable-sized
lobules of poorly-differentiated cells containing some
sebaceous cells. The tumour cells show marked cytologic
atypia such as pleomorphism and hyperchromasia.
C. Tumours of Sweat Glands
A large number of lesions develop from sweat gland
structures, either from apocrine or eccrine glands. These are
more commonly benign but sweat gland carcinoma may also
occur.
1.
ECCRINE TUMOURS. Depending upon the portion of
eccrine sweat gland from which the tumour takes origin, the
eccrine tumours are of 3 types:
i)
arising from intraepidermal portion of the duct e.g. eccrine
poroma;
ii) arising from intradermal portion of the duct e.g.
hidradenoma; and
iii) arising from secretory coils e.g. eccrine spiradenoma.
Eccrine poroma. This tumour arises from intraepidermal
portion of the sweat gland duct. The tumour is found more
commonly on the sole and hands.
Histologically, it consists of tumour cells arising from the
lower portion of the epidermis and extending downward
into dermis as broad anastomosing bands. The tumour
cells are, however, different from squamous cells. They
are smaller in size, cuboidal in shape and have deeply
basophilic nucleus.
Eccrine hidradenoma. Hidradenoma originates from the
intradermal portion of the eccrine sweat duct. The tumour
may occur anywhere in the body.
Histologically, hidradenoma consists of solid masses and
cords of tumour cells which may have an occasional duct-
like structure containing mucin. The tumour cells are
round to polygonal and may have clear or eosinophilic
cytoplasm.
Eccrine spiradenoma. This is found as a solitary, painful,
circumscribed nodule in the dermis.
Histologically, the tumour consists of lobules which are
surrounded by a thin capsule. The tumour lobules contain
2 types of epithelial cells like in the secretory coils of the
eccrine sweat gland. Peripheral cells are small with dark
nuclei, while the centre of lobules contains large cells with
pale nuclei. An occasional area may show glandular
structures.
2.
APOCRINE TUMOURS. Apocrine sweat glands may
give rise to tumours; the two common examples being
papillary hidradenoma and cylindroma.
Papillary hidradenoma. Papillary hidradenoma or hidra-
denoma papilliferrum is usually located as a small lesion
commonly in women in the skin of the anogenital area.
Histologically, it is a circumscribed tumour in the dermis
under a normal epidermis. Papillary hidradenoma
represents an adenoma with apocrine differentiation and
containing papillary, tubular and cystic structures. The
tumour cells lining these structures resemble apocrine
epithelium with features of decapitation secretions.
Cylindroma. Also called as ‘turban tumour’ due to its
common location on the scalp, cylindroma may occur as both
solitary and multiple lesions.
Histologically, the tumour is composed of irregular
islands of tumour cells creating a pattern resembling
jigsaw puzzle. The islands are surrounded by a hyaline
sheath. The tumour cells comprising the islands consist
of 2 types of epithelial cells: peripheral small cells with dark
nuclei, and inner large cells with light staining nuclei. Some
of the islands may contain tubular lumina containing
amorphous material.
3.
SWEAT GLAND CARCINOMA. Rarely, the eccrine and
apocrine gland tumours described above may turn
malignant. All these carcinomas are adenocarcinomas and
must be distinguished from metastatic adenocarcinoma in
the skin.

The tumour shows islands and lobules within the dermis which are

cells. Areas of calcification are also seen.

III.  MELANOCYTIC  TUMOURS
Melanocytic tumours may arise from one of the three cell
types: naevus cells, epidermal melanocytes and dermal
melanocytes.
Benign tumours originating from naevus cells are called
naevocellular naevi.
The examples of benign tumours arising from epidermal
melanocytes are lentigo, freckles, pigmentation associated with
Albright’s syndrome and cafe-au-lait spots of neuro-
fibromatosis (page 838).
Benign tumours derived from dermal melanocytes are
Mongolian spots, naevi of Ota and of Ito and the blue naevus.
Malignant melanoma is the malignant counterpart of
melanocytic tumours.
The important examples amongst these are described
below.
1.
NAEVOCELLULAR NAEVI. Pigmented naevi or moles
are extremely common lesions on the skin of most
individuals. They are often flat or slightly elevated lesions;
rarely they may be papillomatous or pedunculated. Most
naevi appear in adolescence and in early adulthood due to
hormonal influence but rarely may be present at birth. They
are mostly tan to brown and less than 1 cm in size.
Histologically, irrespective of the histologic types, all
naevocellular naevi are composed of ‘naevus cells’ which
are actually identical to melanocytes but differ from
melanocytes in being arranged in clusters or nests. Naevus
cells are cuboidal or oval in shape with homogeneous
cytoplasm and contain large round or oval nucleus.
Melanin pigment is abundant in the naevus cells present
in the lower epidermis and upper dermis, but the cells in
the mid-dermis and lower dermis hardly contain any
melanin (Fig. 26.29).
The important histological variants of naevi are as under:
i)
Lentigo is the replacement of the basal layer of the
epidermis by melanocytes.
ii) Junctional naevus is the one in which the naevus cells
lie at the epidermal-dermal junction. The naevus cells form
well-circumscribed nests.
iii) Compound naevus is the commonest type of pigmented
naevus. These lesions, in addition to the junctional activity
as in junctional naevi, show nests of naevus cells in the dermis
to a variable depth.
iv) Intradermal naevus shows slight or no junctional activity.
The lesion is mainly located in the upper dermis as nests
and cords of naevus cells. Multinucleate naevus cells are
common.
v) Spindle cell (epithelioid) naevus or juvenile melanoma
is a compound naevus with junctional activity. The naevus
cells are, however, elongated and epithelioid in appearance
which may or may not contain melanin. Juvenile melanoma
is important since it is frequently confused with malignant
melanoma histologically.
vi) Blue naevus is characterised by dendritic spindle naevus
cells rather than the usual rounded or cuboidal naevus cells.
These cells are often quite rich in melanin pigment.
vii) Dysplastic naevi are certain atypical naevi which have
increased risk of progression to malignant melanoma. These
lesions are larger than the usual acquired naevi, are often
multiple, and appear as flat macules to slightly elevated
plaques with irregular borders and variable pigmentation.
Many of the cases are familial and inheritable. Dysplastic
naevi have melanocytic proliferation at the epidermo-dermal
junction with some cytologic atypia.
2.
MALIGNANT MELANOMA. Malignant melanoma or
melanocarcinoma arising from melanocytes is one of the most
rapidly spreading malignant tumour of the skin that can
occur at all ages but is rare before puberty. The tumour
spreads locally as well as to distant sites by lymphatics and
by blood. The etiology is unknown but there is role of
excessive exposure of white skin to sunlight e.g. higher
incidence in New Zealand and Australia where sun exposure
in high. Besides the skin, melanomas may occur at various
other sites such as oral and anogenital mucosa, oesophagus,
conjunctiva, orbit (page 512) and leptomeninges. The
common sites on the skin are the trunk (in men), legs (in
women); other locations are face, soles, palms and nail-beds.
Some high risk factors associated with increased
incidence of malignant melanoma are as under:
i) Persistent change in appearance of a mole.
ii) Presence of pre-existing naevus (especially dysplastic
naevus).
iii) Family history of melanoma in a patient of atypical mole.
iii) Higher age of the patient.
iv) More than 50 moles 2 mm or more in diameter.
Molecular studies in familial and hereditary cases have
revealed germline mutation in CDKN2A gene which encodes
for cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, mutational loss of
PTEN gene and mutation in several other tumour suppressor
genes but not p53.
 Clinically, melanoma often appears as a flat or slightly
elevated naevus which has variegated pigmentation,
irregular borders and, of late, has undergone secondary
changes of ulceration, bleeding and increase in size. Many

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
of the malignant melanomas, however, arise de novo rather
than from a pre-existing naevus. Malignant melanoma can
be differentiated from benign pigmented lesions by subtle
features as summed up in Table 26.3; the dermatologists term
this as ABCD of melanoma (acronym for Asymmetry, Border
irregularity, Colour change and Diameter >6mm).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, depending upon
the clinical course and prognosis, cutaneous malignant
melanomas are of the following 4 types:
i) Lentigo maligna melanoma. This often develops from
a pre-existing lentigo (a flat naevus characterised by
replacement of basal layer of epidermis by naevus cells).
It is essentially a malignant melanoma in situ. It is slow-
growing and has good prognosis.
ii) Superficial spreading melanoma. This is a slightly
elevated lesion with variegated colour and ulcerated
surface. It often develops from a superficial spreading
melanoma in situ (pagetoid melanoma) in 5 to 7 years.
The prognosis is worse than for lentigo maligna
melanoma.
iii) Acral lentigenous melanoma. This occurs more
commonly on the soles, palms and mucosal surfaces
(Fig. 26.30). The tumour often undergoes ulceration and
early metastases. The prognosis is worse than that of
superficial spreading melanoma.
iv) Nodular melanoma. This often appears as an elevated
and deeply pigmented nodule that grows rapidly and
undergoes ulceration. This variant carries the worst
prognosis.
Histologically, irrespective of the type of malignant
melanoma, the following characteristics are observed (Fig.
26.31):
i)
Origin. The malignant melanoma, whether arising
from a pre-existing naevus or starting de novo, has marked
junctional activity at the epidermo-dermal junction and
grows downward into the dermis.
ii) Tumour cells. The malignant melanoma cells are
usually larger than the naevus cells. They may be

epithelioid or spindle-shaped, the former being more
common. The tumour cells have amphophilic cytoplasm
and large, pleomorphic nuclei with conspicuous nucleoli.
Mitotic figures are often present and multinucleate giant
cells may occur. These tumour cells may be arranged in
various patterns such as solid masses, sheets, island,
alveoli etc.
iii) Melanin. Melanin pigment may be present (melanotic)
or absent (amelanotic melanoma) without any prognostic
influence. The pigment, if present, tends to be in the form
of uniform fine granules (unlike the benign naevi in which
coarse irregular clumps of melanin are present). At times,
there may be no evidence of melanin in H&E stained
sections but Fontana-Masson stain or dopa reaction reveals
melanin granules in the cytoplasm of tumour cells.
Immunohistochemically, melnoma cells are positive for
HMB-45 (most specific), S-100 and Melan-A.
iv) Inflammatory infiltrate. Some amount of inflam-
matory infiltrate is present in the invasive melanomas.
Infrequently, partial spontaneous regression of the tumour
occurs due to destructive effect of dense inflammatory
infiltrate.

789
CHAPTER 26
The Skin
The prognosis for patients with malignant melanoma is
related to the depth of invasion of the tumour in the dermis.
Depending upon the depth of invasion below the granular
cell layer in millimeters, Clark has described 5 levels:
Level I: Malignant melanoma cells confined to the epidermis
and its appendages.
Level II:
Extension into the papillary dermis.
Level III:
Extension of tumour cells upto the interface
between papillary and reticular dermis.
Level IV:
Invasion of reticular dermis.
Level V:
Invasion of the subcutaneous fat.
Metastatic spread of malignant melanoma is very
common and takes place via lymphatics to the regional
lymph nodes and through blood to distant sites like lungs,
liver, brain, spinal cord, and adrenals. Rarely, the primary
lesion regresses spontaneously but metastases are present
widely distributed.
IV.TUMOURS OF THE DERMIS
All the tissue elements of the dermis such as fibrous tissue,
adipose tissue, neural tissue, endothelium and smooth
muscle are capable of transforming into benign and
malignant tumours. Many of the examples of these tumours
are discussed in Chapter 29 but a few representative dermal
neoplasms are described below.
1.
DERMATOFIBROMA AND MALIGNANT FIBROUS
HISTIOCYTOMA. These soft tissue tumours are composed
of cells having mixed features of fibroblasts, myofibroblasts,
histiocytes and primitive mesenchymal cells. The
histogenesis of these tumours is not quite clear but probably
they arise from multi-directional differentiation of the
primitive mesenchymal cells. The tumours appear at any age
but are more common in advanced age. The commonest sites
are the lower and upper extremities, followed in decreasing
frequency, by abdominal cavity and retroperitoneum. The
benign variant is also known by various synonyms like
dermatofibroma, histiocytoma, sclerosing haemangioma,
fibroxanthoma and xanthogranuloma. Benign histiocytomas
are often small but malignant fibrous histiocytomas may be
of enormous size. They are circumscribed but unencapsu-
lated.
Histologically, the tumours are composed of spindle-
shaped fibrohistiocytoid cells which are characteristically
arranged in cartwheel or storiform pattern. The benign
variety contains uniform spindle-shaped cells with
admixture of numerous foamy histiocytes. The malignant
fibrous histiocytoma shows pleomorphic tumour cells and
some multinucleate giant cells in a stroma that may show
myxoid change and inflammatory infiltrate.
2.
DERMATOFIBROSARCOMA PROTUBERANS. This
is a low-grade fibrosarcoma that rarely metastasises but is
locally recurrent. The tumour usually forms a solid nodule,
within the dermis and subcutaneous fat, protruding the
epidermis outwards. Sometimes multiple nodules may form.
Histologically, the tumour is very cellular and is
composed of uniform fibroblasts arranged in a cartwheel
or storiform pattern. A few mitoses are often present. The
overlying epidermis is generally thinned and may be
ulcerated (Fig. 26.32). The subcutaneous fat is frequently
invaded by the tumour cells.
3.
XANTHOMAS. These are solitary or multiple tumour-
like lesions, often associated with high levels of serum
cholesterol and phospholipids. Many of the cases result from
familial hyperlipidaemia. They may occur at different sites
such as buttocks, knees, elbows, tendo-Achilles, palmar
creases and on the eyelids (referred to as xanthelasma).
Histologically, xanthomas are composed of dermal collec-
tions of benign-appearing foamy histiocytes. Multi-

pleomorphic nuclei and prominent nucleoli are seen as solid masses in the dermis. Many of the tumour cells contain fine granular melanin pigment.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
nucleate tumour giant cells surrounded by lipid-laden
cytoplasm are often present.
V. CELLULAR MIGRANT TUMOURS
All the tumours described above arise from progenitor cells
in the skin only. However, there are some tumours which
have their precursor cells elsewhere in the body, but are
cellular immigrants to the skin. The examples are
Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis (page 385), mycosis fungoides,
mastocytosis, lymphomas and leukaemias (Chapter 14).
Mycosis fungoides is considered here.
MYCOSIS FUNGOIDES (CUTANEOUS T-CELL
LYMPHOMA) AND SEZARY SYNDROME. Mycosis
fungoides or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is the
commonest form of lymphoma in the skin but in advanced

anisonucleosis.
stage, mycosis fungoides may disseminate to the lymph
nodes and other organs. Clinically, mycosis fungoides may
manifest in 3 stages:
i)
Premycotic stage in which the lesions are erythematous,
red-brown, scaly and pruritic, resembling eczema or
psoriasis.
ii) Infiltrative stage has slightly elevated, bluish-red, firm
plaques.
iii) Fungoid (Tumour) stage is characterised by red-brown
nodules of tumour which often undergo ulceration.
The etiology of mycosis fungoides or CTCL has been
found to be the same as for adult T cell lymphoma-leukaemia
syndrome which is human T cell-leukaemia virus-I (HTLV-
I) as discussed on page 227.
Sézary syndrome is a variant of CTCL, often due to
dissemination of underlying CTCL to the blood and infil-
tration into the skin causing generalised erythroderma,
lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly.
The condition is found more frequently beyond 4th
decade of life. Lesions may affect different body surfaces but
often involve the trunk, extremities, face and scalp.
Histologically, the condition has the following charac-
teristics:
i)
Initially, lower portion of the epidermis contains
hyperchromatic enlarged lymphocytes. In about half the
cases, there is formation of intraepidermal clusters of
atypical lymphoid cells forming Darier-Pautrier’s
microabscesses which is a misnomer as it does not contain
pus cells.
ii) Later, there are band-like sharply demarcated
aggregates of polymorphous cellular infiltrate in the
dermis including atypical lymphoid cells (Sézary-Lutzner
cells) and multinucleated cells.
iii) The individual mycosis cells are malignant T lympho-
cytes which have hyperchromatic and cerebriform nuclei
and express CD4 and HLA-DR antigen.

The Endocrine System
The Endocrine System
Chapter 27
Chapter 27
ENDOCRINES: THE BASIC CONCEPT
The development, structure and functions of human body
are governed and maintained by 2 mutually interlinked
systems—the endocrine system and the nervous system (Chapter
30); a third system combining features of both these systems
is appropriately called neuroendocrine system.
NEUROENDOCRINE SYSTEM
This system forms a link between the endocrine and nervous
systems. The cells of this system elaborate polypeptide
hormones; owing to these biochemical properties, it has also
been called as APUD cell system (acronym for Amine
Precursor Uptake and Decarboxylation properties).
However, though having common biochemical properties,
the cells of this system are widely distributed in the body in
different anatomic areas and hence is currently called
dispersed neuroendocrine system.  Cells comprising this system
are as under:
1. Neuroendocrine cells are present in the gastric and intestinal
mucosa and elaborate peptide hormones.
2. Neuroganglia cells lie in the ganglia cells in the sympathetic
chain and elaborate amines.
3. Adrenal medulla elaborates epinephrine and norepinephrine.
4. Parafollicular C cells of the thyroid secrete calcitonin.
5. Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas (included in both
endocrine and neuroendocrine systems) secrete insulin.
6. Isolated cells in the left atrium of the heart secrete atrial
natriuretic (salt-losing) peptide hormone.
In addition to above, other non-endocrine secretions
include neurotransmitter substances such as acetylcholine and
dopamine released from neural synapses, and erythropoietin
and vitamin D3 elaborated from the kidney.
THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM
Anatomically, the endocrine system consists of 6 distinct
organs: pituitary, adrenals, thyroid, parathyroids, gonads,
and pancreatic islets; the last one is included in neuro-
endocrine system also). Understanding the patholgy of these
endocrine organs requires the knowledge of overall frame-
work of hormone secretions, their actions and broad
principles of feedback mechanisms.
Broadly speaking, human hormones are divided into 5
major classes which are further grouped under two headings
depending upon their site of interactions on the target cell
receptors (whether cell membrane or nuclear receptor):
Group I: Those interacting with cell-surface membrane
receptors:
1.
Amino acid derivatives: thyroid hormone, catecholamines.
2.
Small neuropeptides: gonadotropin-releasing hormone
(GnRH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), somatostatin,
vasopressin.
Group II: Those interacting with intracellular nuclear
receptors:
3. Large proteins: insulin, luteinising hormone (LH), para-
thormone hormone.
4. Steroid hormones: cortisol, estrogen.
5. Vitamin derivatives: retinol (vitamin A) and vitamin D.
The synthesis of these hormones and their precursors takes
place through a prescribed genetic pathway that involves:
transcription → mRNA → protein synthesis → post-
translational protein processing → intracellular sorting/
membrane integration → secretion.
Major functions of hormones are as under:
i) Growth and differentiation of cells: by pituitary hormones,
thyroid, parathyroid, steroid hormones.
ii) Maintenance of homeostasis: thyroid (by regulating BMR),
parathormone, mineralocorticoids, vasopressin, insulin.
iii) Reproduction: sexual development and activity, pregnancy,
foetal development, menopause etc.
A basic feature of all endocrine glands is the existence of
both negative and positive feedback control system that
stimulates or regulates hormone production in a way that levels
remain within the normal range (abbreviated as S or R
respectively with the corresponding  hormone e.g. TSH-TRH
pathway, GnRH-LH/FSH pathway etc). This system is
commonly termed hypothalamic-pituitary hormone axis for
different hormones schematically illustrated in Fig. 27.1. The
stimulatory or regulatory action by endocrine hormonal
secretions may follow paracrine or autocrine pathways:
Paracrine regulation means that the stimulatory/
regulatory factors are released by one type of cells but act on
another adjacent cell of the system.
Autocrine regulation refers to action of the factor on the
same cell that produced it.
With this brief overview of principles of physiology of
hormones, we now turn to the study of diseases of the
endocrine organs. In general, pathologic processes affecting
endocrine glands with resultant hormonal abnormalities may
occur from following processes:
Hyperfunction: This results from excess of hormone secreting
tissues e.g. hyperplasia, tumours (adenoma, carcinoma),
ectopic hormone production, excessive stimulation from

792
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
inflammation (often autoimmune), infections, iatrogenic
(drugs-induced, hormonal administration).
Hypofunction: Deficiency of hormones occurs from
destruction of hormone-forming tissues from inflammations
(often autoimmune), infections, iatrogenic (e.g. surgical
removal, radiation damage), developmental defects (e.g.
Turner’s syndrome, hypoplasia), enzyme deficiency,
haemorrhage and infarction (e.g. Sheehan’s syndrome),
nutritional deficiency (e.g. iodine deficiency).
Hormone resistance: There may be adequate or excessive
production of a hormone but there is peripheral resistance,
often from inherited mutations in receptors (e.g. defect in
membrane receptors, nuclear receptors or receptor for signal
transduction).
PITUITARY GLAND
NORMAL STRUCTURE
ANATOMY. The pituitary gland or hypophysis in an adult
weighs about 500 mg and is slightly heavier in females. It is
situated at the base of the brain in a hollow called sella turcica
formed out of the sphenoid bone. The gland is composed of
2 major anatomic divisions: anterior lobe (adenohypophysis)
and posterior lobe (neurohypophysis).
Figure 27.1
Endocrine organs and the presence of feedback controls. Both positive and negative feedback controls exist for each endocrine
gland having a regulating (R) and stimulating (S) hormone. Those acting through hypothalamic-pituitary axis include: thyroid hormones on TRH-
TSH axis, cortisol on CRH-ACTH axis, gonadal steroids on GnRH-LH/FSH axis and insulin-like GH on GHRH-GH axis. Those independent of
pituitary control (shown by interrupted arrows) have also feedback controls by calcium on PTH, and hypoglycaemia on insulin release by pancreatic
islets.

793
CHAPTER 27
The Endocrine System
1.
The anterior lobe or adenohypophysis is an ectodermal
derivative formed from Rathke’s pouch which is an upward
diverticulum from the primitive buccal cavity. The
adenohypophysis has no direct neural connection but has
indirect connection through capillary portal circulation by
which the anterior pituitary receives the blood which has
already passed through the hypothalamus.
2.
The posterior lobe or neurohypophysis is a downgrowth
from the primitive neural tissue. The neurohypophysis,
therefore, has direct neural connection superiorly with the
hypothalamus.
HISTOLOGY AND FUNCTIONS. The histology and
functions of the anterior and posterior lobes of the pituitary
gland are quite distinct.
A. ANTERIOR LOBE (ADENOHYPOPHYSIS). It is com-
posed of round to polygonal epithelial cells arranged in cords
and islands having fibrovascular stroma. These epithelial
cells, depending upon their staining characteristics and
functions, are divided into 3 types, each of which performs
separate functions:
1.
Chromophil cells with acidophilic granules: These cells
comprise about 40% of the anterior lobe and are chiefly
located in the lateral wings. The acidophils are further of 2
types:
i)
Somatotrophs (GH cells) which produce growth hormone
(GH).
ii) Lactotrophs (PRL cells) which produce prolactin (PRL).
Cells containing both GH and PRL called mammo-
somatotrophs are also present.
2.
Chromophil cells with basophilic granules: These cells
constitute about 10% of the anterior lobe and are mainly
found in the region of median wedge. The chromatophils
include 3 types of cells:
i)
Gonadotrophs (FSH-LH cells) which are the source of the
FSH and LH or interstitial cell stimulating hormone (ICSH).
ii) Thyrotrophs (TSH cells) are the cells producing TSH.
iii) Corticotrophs (ACTH-MSH cells) produce ACTH,
melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), β-lipoprotein and
β-endorphin.
3.
Chromophobe cells without visible granules: These cells
comprise the remainder 50% of the adenohypophysis. These
cells by light microscopy contain no visible granules, but on
electron microscopy reveal sparsely granulated cortico-
trophs, thyrotrophs and gonadotrophs.
All these functions of the adenohypophysis are under the
indirect control of the hypothalamus through stimulatory and
inhibitory factors synthesised by the hypothalamus which
reach the anterior lobe through capillary portal blood.
B. POSTERIOR LOBE (NEUROHYPOPHYSIS). The
neurohypophysis is composed mainly of interlacing nerve
fibres in which are scattered specialised glial cells called
pituicytes. These nerve fibres on electron microscopy contain
granules of neurosecretory material made up of 2
octapeptides—vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone (ADH), and
oxytocin, both of which are produced by neurosecretory cells
of the hypothalamus but are stored in the cells of posterior
pituitary.
1.
ADH causes reabsorption of water from the renal tubules
and is essential for maintenance of osmolality of the plasma.
Its deficiency results in diabetes insipidus characterised by
uncontrolled diuresis and polydipsia.
2.
Oxytocin causes contraction of mammary myoepithelial
cells resulting in ejection of milk from the lactating breast
and causes contraction of myometrium of the uterus at term.
It is obvious from the description above that pituitary,
though a tiny organ, is concerned with a variety of diverse
functions in the body. The pituitary gland and hypothalamus
are so closely interlinked that diseases of the pituitary gland
involve the hypothalamus, and dysfunctions of the
hypothalamus cause secondary changes in the pituitary. The
pituitary gland is involved in several diseases which include:
non-neoplastic (e.g. inflammations, haemorrhage, trauma,
infarction and many other endocrine diseases) and neoplastic
diseases. However, functionally and morphologically,
diseases of the pituitary can be classified as below, each of
which includes diseases of the anterior and posterior
pituitary and the hypothalamus, separately:
i)
Hyperpituitarism
ii) Hypopituitarism
iii) Pituitary tumours
HYPERPITUITARISM
Hyperpituitarism is characterised by oversecretion of one or
more of the pituitary hormones. Such hypersecretion may
be due to diseases of the anterior pituitary, posterior pituitary
or hypothalamus. For all practical purposes, however,
hyperfunction of the anterior pituitary is due to the
development of a hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma
(discussed later), and rarely, a carcinoma. For each of the
hormonal hyperfunction of the anterior pituitary, posterior
pituitary and hypothalamus, a clinical syndrome is described.
A few important syndromes are as follows:
A. Hyperfunction of Anterior Pituitary
Three common syndromes of adenohypophyseal hyper-
function are: gigantism and acromegaly, hyperprolacti-
naemia and Cushing’s syndrome.
GIGANTISM AND ACROMEGALY. Both these clinical
syndromes result from sustained excess of growth hormone
(GH), most commonly by somatotroph (GH-secreting)
adenoma.
Gigantism. When GH excess occurs prior to epiphyseal
closure, gigantism is produced. Gigantism, therefore, occurs
in prepubertal boys and girls and is much less frequent than
acromegaly. The main clinical feature in gigantism is the
excessive and proportionate growth of the child. There is
enlargement as well as thickening of the bones resulting in
considerable increase in height and enlarged thoracic cage.
Acromegaly. Acromegaly results when there is overproduc-
tion of GH in adults following cessation of bone growth and

794
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
is more common than gigantism. The term ‘acromegaly’
means increased growth of extremities (acro=extremity).
There is enlargement of hands and feet, coarseness of facial
features with increase in soft tissues, prominent supraorbital
ridges and a more prominent lower jaw which when clenched
results in protrusion of the lower teeth in front of upper teeth
(prognathism). Other features include enlargement of the
tongue and lips, thickening of the skin and kyphosis.
Sometimes, a few associated features such as TSH excess
resulting in thyrotoxicosis, and gonadotropin insufficiency
causing amenorrhoea in the females and impotence in the
male, are found.
HYPERPROLACTINAEMIA. Hyperprolactinaemia is the
excessive production of prolactin (PRL), most commonly by
lactotroph (PRL-secreting) adenoma, also called prolac-
tinoma. Occasionally, hyperprolactinaemia results from
hypothalamic inhibition of PRL secretion by certain drugs
(e.g. chlorpromazine, reserpine and methyl-dopa). In the
female, hyperprolactinaemia causes amenorrhoea-galactorrhoea
syndrome characterised clinically by infertility and expression
of a drop or two of milk from breast, not related to pregnancy
or puerperium. In the male, it may cause impotence or reduced
libido. These features result either from associated inhibition
of gonadotropin secretion or interference in gonadotropin
effects.
CUSHING’S SYNDROME. Pituitary-dependent Cushing’s
syndrome results from ACTH excess. Most frequently, it is
caused by corticotroph (ACTH-secreting) adenoma.
Cushing’s syndrome is discussed under diseases of the
adrenal gland on page 797.
B. Hyperfunction of Posterior Pituitary and
Hypothalamus
Lesions of posterior pituitary and hypothalamus are
uncommon. Two of the syndromes associated with hyper-
function of the posterior pituitary and hypothalamus are:
inappropriate release of ADH and precocious puberty.
INAPPROPRIATE RELEASE OF ADH. Inappropriate
release of ADH results in its excessive secretion which
manifests clinically by passage of concentrated urine due to
increased reabsorption of water and loss of sodium in the
urine, consequent hyponatraemia, haemodilution and
expansion of intra- and extracellular fluid volume.
Inappropriate release of ADH occurs most often in
paraneoplastic syndrome e.g. in oat cell carcinoma of the
lung, carcinoma of the pancreas, lymphoma and thymoma.
Infrequently, lesions of the hypothalamus such as trauma,
haemorrhage and meningitis may produce ADH
hypersecretion. Rarely, pulmonary diseases such as
tuberculosis, lung abscess, pneumoconiosis, empyema and
pneumonia may cause overproduction of ADH.
PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY. A tumour in the region of
hypothalamus or the pineal gland may result in premature
release of gonadotropins causing the onset of pubertal
changes prior to the age of 9 years. The features include
premature development of genitalia both in the male and in
the female, growth of pubic hair and axillary hair. In the
female, there is breast growth and onset of menstruation.
HYPOPITUITARISM
In hypopituitarism, there is usually deficiency of one or more
of the pituitary hormones affecting either anterior pituitary,
or posterior pituitary and hypothalamus.
A. Hypofunction of Anterior Pituitary
Adenohypophyseal hypofunction is invariably due to
destruction of the anterior lobe of more than 75% because
the anterior pituitary possesses a large functional reserve.
This may result from anterior pituitary lesions or pressure
and destruction from adjacent lesions. Lesions of the anterior
pituitary include nonsecretory (chromophobe) adenoma,
metastatic carcinoma, craniopharyngioma, trauma,
postpartum ischaemic necrosis (Sheehan’s syndrome),
empty-sella syndrome, and rarely, tuberculosis. Though a
number of syndromes associated with deficiency of anterior
pituitary hormones have been described, two important
syndromes are panhypopituitarism and dwarfism.
PANHYPOPITUITARISM. The classical clinical condition
of major anterior pituitary insufficiency is called
panhypopituitarism. Three most common causes of
panhypopituitarism are: non-secretory (chromophobe)
adenoma (discussed later), Sheehan’s syndrome and
Simmond’s disease, and empty-sella syndrome.
Sheehan’s syndrome and Simmond’s disease. Pituitary
insufficiency occurring due to postpartum pituitary
(Sheehan’s) necrosis is called Sheehan’s syndrome, whereas
occurrence of similar process without preceding pregnancy
as well as its occurrence in males is termed Simmond’s
disease. The main pathogenetic mechanism underlying
Sheehan’s necrosis is the enlargement of the pituitary
occurring during pregnancy which may be followed by
hypotensive shock precipitating ischaemic necrosis of the
pituitary. Other mechanisms hypothesised are: DIC
following delivery, traumatic injury to vessels, and excessive
haemorrhage. Patients with long-standing diabetes mellitus
appear to be at greater risk of developing this complication.
The first clinical manifestation of Sheehan’s syndrome is
failure of lactation following delivery which is due to
deficiency of prolactin. Subsequently, other symptoms
develop which include loss of axillary and pubic hair,
amenorrhoea, sterility and loss of libido. Concomitant defi-
ciency of TSH and ACTH may result in hypothyroidism and
adrenocortical insufficiency.
The morphologic features in the anterior pituitary in
Sheehan’s syndrome during early stage are ischaemic
necrosis and haemorrhage, while later necrotic tissue is
replaced by fibrous tissue.
Empty-sella syndrome. Empty-sella syndrome is charac-
terised by the appearance of an empty sella and features of
panhypopituitarism. Most commonly, it results from
herniation of subarachnoid space into the sella turcica due

795
CHAPTER 27
The Endocrine System
to an incomplete diaphragma sella creating an empty sella.
Other less common causes are Sheehan’s syndrome,
infarction and scarring in an adenoma, irradiation damage,
or surgical removal of the gland.
PITUITARY DWARFISM. Severe deficiency of GH in
children before growth is completed results in retarded
growth and pituitary dwarfism. Most commonly, isolated
GH deficiency is the result of an inherited autosomal
recessive disorder. Less often it may be due to a pituitary
adenoma or craniopharyngioma, infarction and trauma to
the pituitary. The clinical features of inherited cases of
pituitary dwarfism appear after one year of age. These
include proportionate retardation in growth of bones, normal
mental state for age, poorly-developed genitalia, delayed
puberty and episodes of hypoglycaemia. Pituitary dwarf
must be distinguished from hypothyroid dwarf (cretinism)
in which there is achondroplasia and mental retardation
(page 803).
B. Hypofunction of Posterior Pituitary and
Hypothalamus
Insufficiency of the posterior pituitary and hypothalamus is
uncommon. The only significant clinical syndrome due to
hypofunction of the neurohypophysis and hypothalamus is
diabetes insipidus.
DIABETES INSIPIDUS. Deficient secretion of ADH causes
diabetes insipidus. The causes of ADH deficiency are:
inflammatory and neoplastic lesions of the hypothalamo-
hypophyseal axis, destruction of neurohypophysis due to
surgery, radiation, head injury, and lastly, are those cases
where no definite cause is known and are labelled as
idiopathic. The main features of diabetes insipidus are
excretion of a very large volume of dilute urine of low specific
gravity (below 1.010), polyuria and polydipsia.
PITUITARY TUMOURS
Tumours of the anterior pituitary are more common than
those of the posterior pituitary and hypothalamus. The most
common of the anterior pituitary tumours are adenomas;
primary and metastatic carcinomas being rare. Cranio-
pharyngioma and granular cell tumour (choristoma) are the
other benign pituitary tumours found occasionally.
All pituitary tumours, whether benign or malignant,
cause symptoms by following 2 ways:
1.
Pressure effects. These are caused by expansion of the
lesion resulting in destruction of the surrounding glandular
tissue by pressure atrophy. This causes erosion and
enlargement of sella turcica, upward extension of the tumour
damaging the optic chiasma, optic nerves, neurohypophysis
and adjacent cranial nerves, and rarely, downward extension
into the nasopharynx.
2.
Hormonal effects. Depending upon their cell types,
pituitary adenomas produce excess of pituitary hormones
and the corresponding clinical syndromes of hyper-
pituitarism. Infarction and destruction of adenoma may cause
symptoms of hypopituitarism.
Pituitary Adenomas
Adenomas are the most common pituitary tumours. They
are conventionally classified according to their H & E staining
characteristics of granules into acidophil, basophil and
chromophobe adenomas. However, this morphologic
classification is considered quite inadequate because of the
significant functional characteristics of each type of adenoma
including the chromophobe adenoma, which on H & E
staining does not show visible granules. As a result of
advances in the ultrastructural and immunocytochemical
studies, a functional classification of pituitary adenoma has
emerged. Table 27.1 presents a classification of pituitary
adenomas based on functional features as correlated with
morphologic features of older classification. The syndromes
produced by the tumours have been described already.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, pituitary
adenomas range in size from small foci of less than 10
mm in size (termed microadenoma) to large adenomas
several centimeters in diameter. They are spherical, soft
and encapsulated.
Histologically, by light microscopy of H & E stained
sections, an adenoma is composed predominantly of one
of the normal cell types of the anterior pituitary i.e.

Systemic Pathology
acidophil, basophil or chromophobe cells. These cells may
have following 3 types of patterns:
1.
Diffuse pattern is composed of polygonal cells arranged
in sheets with scanty stroma.
2.
Sinusoidal pattern consists of columnar or fusiform cells
with fibrovascular stroma around which the tumour cells
are arranged (Fig. 27.2).
3.
Papillary pattern is composed of columnar or fusiform
cells arranged about fibrovascular papillae.
Functionally, most common pituitary adenomas, in
decreasing order of frequency, are: lactotroph (PRL-secreting)
adenoma, somatotroph (GH-secreting) adenoma and
corticotroph (ACTH-secreting) adenoma. Infrequently,
mixed somatotroph-lactotroph (GH-PRL-secreting)
adenoma, gonadotroph (FSH-LH-secreting) adenomas and
null-cell (endocrinologically inactive) adenomas or
oncocytoma are found. Pleurihormonal-pituitary adenoma,
on the other hand, may have multiple hormone elaborations.
Functional classification of pituitary adenoma can be done
by carrying out specific immunostains against the hormone
products.
Pituitary adenoma may also occur as a part of multiple
endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN-I) in which adenomas of
pancreatic islets, parathyroids and the pituitary are found
(page 829). Clinically, the patients are characterised by
combination of features of Zollinger-Ellison’s syndrome,
hyperparathyroidism and hyperpituitarism.
Craniopharyngioma
Craniopharyngioma is a benign tumour arising from
remnants of Rathke’s pouch. It is more common in children
and young adults. The tumour, though benign, compresses
as well as invades the adjacent structures extensively.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
encapsulated, adherent to surrounding structures and is
typically cystic, reddish-grey mass.
Histologically, craniopharyngioma closely resembles
ameloblastoma of the jaw (page 530). There are 2 distinct
histologic features:
1.
Stratified squamous epithelium frequently lining, a
cyst and containing loose stellate cells in the centre; and
2.
Solid ameloblastous areas.
Granular Cell Tumour (Choristoma)
Though tumours of the posterior pituitary are rare, granular
cell tumour or choristoma is the most common tumour of
the neurohypophysis. It is composed of a mass of cells having
granular eosinophilic cytoplasm similar to the cells of the
posterior pituitary. It arises as a result of developmental
anomaly and hence the name choristoma. Generally, it
remains asymptomatic and is discovered as an incidental
autopsy finding.
ADRENAL GLAND
NORMAL STRUCTURE
ANATOMY. The adrenal glands lie at the upper pole of each
kidney. Each gland weighs approximately 4 gm in the adult
but in children the adrenals are proportionately larger. On
sectioning, the adrenal is composed of 2 distinct parts: an
outer yellow-brown cortex and an inner grey medulla. The
anatomic and functional integrity of adrenal cortices are
essential for life, while it does not hold true for adrenal
medulla.
HISTOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY. Microscopically and
functionally, cortex and medulla are quite distinct.
ADRENAL CORTEX. It is composed of 3 layers:
1.
Zona glomerulosa is the outer layer and comprises about
10% of the cortex. It consists of cords or columns of
polyhedral cells just under the capsule. This layer is
responsible for the synthesis of mineralocorticoids, the most
important of which is aldosterone, the salt and water
regulating hormone.
2.
Zona fasciculata is the middle layer and constitutes
approximately 70% of the cortex. It is composed of columns
of lipid-rich cells which are precursors of various steroid
hormones manufactured in the adrenal cortex such as
glucocorticoids (e.g. cortisol) and sex steroids (e.g.
testosterone).
3.
Zona reticularis is the inner layer which makes up the
remainder of the adrenal cortex. It consists of cords of more
compact cells than those of zona fasciculata but has similar
functional characteristics of synthesis and secretion of
glucocorticoids and androgens.
The synthesis of glucocorticoids and adrenal androgens
is under the control of ACTH from hypothalamus-anterior
pituitary. In turn, ACTH release is under the control of a
hypothalamic releasing factor called corticotropin-releasing
factor. Release of aldosterone, on the other hand, is
independent of ACTH control and is largely regulated by
the serum levels of potassium and renin-angiotensin
mechanism (page 98).

CHAPTER 27
The Endocrine System
ADRENAL MEDULLA. The adrenal medulla is a component
of the dispersed neuroendocrine system derived from
primitive neuroectoderm; the other components of this
system being paraganglia distributed in the vagi,
paravertebral and visceral autonomic ganglia. The cells
comprising this system are neuroendocrine cells, the major
function of which is synthesis and secretion of catecholamines
(epinephrine and norepinephrine). Various other peptides
such as calcitonin, somatostatin and vasoactive intestinal
polypeptide (VIP) are also secreted by these cells. The major
metabolites of catecholamines are metanephrine, nor-me-
tanephrine, vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic
acid (HVA). In case of damage to the adrenal medulla, its
function is taken over by other paraganglia.
Diseases affecting the two parts of adrenal glands are
quite distinctive in view of distinct morphology, and function
of the adrenal cortex and medulla. While the disorders of
the adrenal cortex include adrenocortical hyperfunction
(hyperadrenalism), adrenocortical insufficiency (hypo-
adrenalism) and adrenocortical tumours, the main lesions
affecting the adrenal medulla are the medullary tumours.
ADRENOCORTICAL HYPERFUNCTION
(HYPERADRENALISM)
Hypersecretion of each of the three types of corticosteroids
elaborated by the adrenal cortex causes distinct
corresponding hyperadrenal clinical syndromes:
1.
Cushing’s syndrome caused by excess of glucocorticoids
(i.e. cortisol); also called chronic hypercortisolism.
2.
Conn’s syndrome caused by oversecretion of mineralo-
corticoids (i.e. aldosterone); also called primary hyper-
aldosteronism.
3.
Adrenogenital syndrome characterised by excessive produc-
tion of adrenal sex steroids (i.e. androgens); also called adrenal
virilism.
Mixed forms of these clinical syndromes may also occur.
Cushing’s Syndrome (Chronic Hypercortisolism)
Cushing’s syndrome is caused by excessive production of
cortisol of whatever cause. The full clinical expression of the
syndrome, however, includes contribution of the secondary
derangements.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. There are 4 major etiologic types
of Cushing’s syndrome which should be distinguished for
effective treatment.
1.
Pituitary Cushing’s syndrome. About 60-70% cases of
Cushing’s syndrome are caused by excessive secretion of
ACTH due to a lesion in the pituitary gland, most commonly
a corticotroph adenoma or multiple corticotroph
microadenomas. This group of cases was first described by
Harvey Cushing, an American neurosurgeon, who termed
the condition as Cushing’s disease. Also included in this
group are cases with hypothalamic origin of excessive ACTH
levels without apparent pituitary lesion. All cases with
pituitary Cushing’s syndrome are characterised by bilateral
adrenal cortical hyperplasia and elevated ACTH levels. These
cases show therapeutic response on administration of high
doses of dexamethasone which suppresses ACTH secretion
and causes fall in plasma cortisol level.
2.
Adrenal Cushing’s syndrome. Approximately 20-25%
cases of Cushing’s syndrome are caused by disease in one or
both the adrenal glands. These include adrenal cortical
adenoma, carcinoma, and less often, cortical hyperplasia.
This group of cases is characterised by low serum ACTH
levels and absence of therapeutic response to administration
of high doses of glucocorticoid.
3.
Ectopic Cushing’s syndrome. About 10-15% cases of
Cushing’s syndrome have an origin in ectopic ACTH elabo-
ration by non-endocrine tumours. Most often, the tumour is
an oat cell carcinoma of the lung but other lung cancers,
malignant thymoma and pancreatic tumours have also been
implicated. The plasma ACTH level is high in these cases
and cortisol secretion is not suppressed by dexamethasone
administration.
4.
Iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome. Prolonged therapeutic
administration of high doses of glucocorticoids or ACTH may
result in Cushing’s syndrome e.g. in organ transplant
recipients and in autoimmune diseases. These cases are
generally associated with bilateral adrenocortical
insufficiency.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Cushing’s syndrome occurs more
often in patients between the age of 20-40 years with three
times higher frequency in women than in men. The severity
of the syndrome varies considerably, but in general the
following features characterise a case of Cushing’s syndrome:
1.
Central or truncal obesity contrasted with relatively thin
arms and legs, buffalo hump due to prominence of fat over
the shoulders, and rounded oedematous moon-face.
2.
Increased protein breakdown resulting in wasting and
thinning of the skeletal muscles, atrophy of the skin and
subcutaneous tissue with formation of purple striae on the
abdominal wall, osteoporosis and easy bruisability of the thin
skin to minor trauma.
3.
Systemic hypertension is present in 80% of cases because
of associated retention of sodium and water.
4.
Impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus are found
in about 20% cases.
5.
Amenorrhoea, hirsutism and infertility in many women.
6.
Insomnia, depression, confusion and psychosis.
Conn’s Syndrome (Primary Hyperaldosteronism)
This is an uncommon syndrome occurring due to overpro-
duction of aldosterone, the potent  salt-retaining hormone.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The condition results primarily due
to adrenocortical diseases as follows:
1.
Adrenocortical adenoma, producing aldosterone.
2.
Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, especially in children
(congenital hyperaldosteronism).
3.
Rarely, adrenal carcinoma.
Primary hyperaldosteronism from any of the above causes
is associated with low plasma renin levels. Secondary
hyperaldosteronism, on the contrary, occurs in response to high
plasma renin level due to overproduction of renin by the
kidneys such as in renal ischaemia, reninoma or oedema.

798
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
CLINICAL FEATURES. Conn’s syndrome is more frequent
in adult females. Its principal features are as under:
1.
Hypertension, usually mild to moderate diastolic
hypertension.
2.
Hypokalaemia and associated muscular weakness,
peripheral neuropathy and cardiac arrhythmias.
3.
Retention of sodium and water.
4.
Polyuria and polydipsia due to reduced concentrating
power of the renal tubules.
Adrenogenital Syndrome (Adrenal Virilism)
Adrenal cortex secretes a smaller amount of sex steroids than
the gonads. However, adrenocortical hyperfunction may
occasionally cause sexual disturbances.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Hypersecretion of sex steroids,
mainly androgens, may occur in children or in adults:
1.
In children, it is due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia in
which there is congenital deficiency of a specific enzyme.
2.
In adults, it is caused by an adrenocortical adenoma or a
carcinoma. Cushing’s syndrome is often present as well.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The clinical features depend upon
the age and sex of the patient.
1.
In children, there is distortion of the external genitalia in
girls, and precocious puberty in boys.
2.
In adults, the features in females show virilisation (e.g.
hirsutism, oligomenorrhoea, deepening of voice, hyper-
trophy of the clitoris); and in males may rarely cause
feminisation.
3.
There is generally increased excretion of 17-ketosteroids
in the urine.
ADRENOCORTICAL INSUFFICIENCY
(HYPOADRENALISM)
Adrenocortical insufficiency may result from deficient
synthesis of cortical steroids from the adrenal cortex or may
be secondary to ACTH deficiency. Three types of
adrenocortical hypofunction are distinguished:
1.
Primary adrenocortical insufficiency caused primarily by the
disease of the adrenal glands. Two forms are described: acute
or ‘adrenal crisis’, and chronic or ‘Addison’s disease’.
2.
Secondary adrenocortical insufficiency resulting from
diminished secretion of ACTH.
3.
Hypoaldosteronism characterised by deficient secretion of
aldosterone.
PRIMARY ADRENOCORTICAL INSUFFICIENCY
Primary adrenal hypofunction occurs due to defect in the
adrenal glands and normal pituitary function. It may develop
in 2 ways:
A. Acute primary adrenocortical insufficiency or ‘adrenal
crisis’.
B. Chronic primary adrenocortical insufficiency or
‘Addison’s disease’.
A. Primary Acute Adrenocortical Insufficiency
(Adrenal Crisis)
Sudden loss of adrenocortical function may result in an acute
condition called adrenal crisis.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Causes of acute insufficiency are
as under:
1.
Bilateral adrenalectomy e.g. in the treatment of cortical
hyperfunction, hypertension and in selected cases of breast
cancer.
2.
Septicaemia e.g. in endotoxic shock and meningococcal
infection producing grossly haemorrhagic and necrotic
adrenal cortex termed adrenal apoplexy. The acute condition
so produced is called Waterhouse-Friderichsen’s syndrome.
3.
Rapid withdrawal of steroids.
4.
Any form of acute stress in a case of chronic insufficiency
i.e. in Addison’s disease.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Clinical features of acute adreno-
cortical insufficiency are due to deficiency of mineralo-
corticoids and glucocorticoids. These are as follows:
1.
Deficiency of mineralocorticoids (i.e. aldosterone
deficiency) result in salt deficiency, hyperkalaemia and
dehydration.
2.
Deficiency of glucocorticoids (i.e. cortisol deficiency)
leads to hypoglycaemia, increased insulin sensitivity and
vomitings.
B. Primary Chronic Adrenocortical Insufficiency
(Addison’s Disease)
Progressive chronic destruction of more than 90% of adrenal
cortex on both sides results in an uncommon clinical
condition called Addison’s disease.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Any condition which causes
marked chronic adrenal destruction may produce Addison’s
disease. These include: tuberculosis, autoimmune or
idiopathic adrenalitis, histoplasmosis, amyloidosis,
metastatic cancer, sarcoidosis and haemochromatosis.
However, currently the first two causes—tuberculosis and
autoimmune chronic destruction of adrenal glands, are
implicated in majority of cases of Addison’s disease.
Irrespective of the cause, the adrenal glands are bilaterally
small and irregularly shrunken. Histologic changes,
depending upon the cause, may reveal specific features as
in tuberculosis and histoplasmosis, or the changes may be
in the form of nonspecific lymphocytic infiltrate as in
idiopathic (autoimmune) adrenalitis.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Clinical manifestations develop
slowly and insidiously. The usual features are as under:
1.
Asthenia i.e. progressive weakness, weight loss and
lethargy as the cardinal symptoms.
2.
Hyperpigmentation, initially most marked on exposed
areas, but later involves unexposed parts and mucous
membranes as well.
3.
Arterial hypotension.
4.
Vague upper gastrointestinal symptoms such as mild loss
of appetite, nausea, vomiting and upper abdominal pain.
5.
Lack of androgen causing loss of hair in women.
6.
Episodes of hypoglycaemia.
7.
Biochemical changes include reduced GFR, acidosis,
hyperkalaemia and low levels of serum sodium, chloride and
bicarbonate.

799
CHAPTER 27
The Endocrine System
SECONDARY ADRENOCORTICAL INSUFFICIENCY
Adrenocortical insufficiency resulting from deficiency of
ACTH is called secondary adrenocortical insufficiency.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. ACTH deficiency may appear in
2 settings :
1.
Selective ACTH deficiency due to prolonged administration
of high doses of glucocorticoids. This leads to suppression
of ACTH release from the pituitary gland and selective
deficiency.
2.
Panhypopituitarism due to hypothalamus-pituitary
diseases is associated with deficiency of multiple trophic
hormones (page 794).
CLINICAL FEATURES. The clinical features of secondary
adrenocortical insufficiency are like those of Addison’s
disease except the following:
1.
These cases lack hyperpigmentation because of
suppressed production of melanocyte-stimulating hormone
(MSH) from the pituitary.
2.
Plasma ACTH levels are low-to-absent in secondary
insufficiency but are elevated in Addison’s disease.
3.
Aldosterone levels are normal due to stimulation by
renin.
HYPOALDOSTERONISM
Isolated deficiency of aldosterone with normal cortisol level
may occur in association with reduced renin secretion.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The causes of such hyporeninism
are as follows:
1.
Congenital defect due to deficiency of an enzyme required
for its synthesis.
2.
Prolonged administration of heparin.
3.
Certain diseases of the brain.
4.
Excision of an aldosterone-secreting tumour.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The patients of isolated hypo-
aldosteronism are adults with mild renal failure and diabetes
mellitus. The predominant features are hyperkalaemia and
metabolic acidosis.
TUMOURS OF ADRENAL GLANDS
Primary tumours of the adrenal glands are uncommon and
include distinct adrenocortical tumours and medullary
tumours. However, adrenal gland is a more common site for
metastatic carcinoma.
ADRENOCORTICAL TUMOURS
Cortical Adenoma
The commonest cortical tumour is adenoma. They are
indistinguishable from hyperplastic nodules except that
lesions smaller than 2 cm diameter are labelled hyperplastic
nodules. A cortical adenoma is a benign and slow-growing
tumour. It is usually small and nonfunctional. A few large
adenomas may, however, produce excess of cortisol,
aldosterone or androgen. Association of cortical adenomas
with systemic hypertension has been suggested by some
workers. Occasionally, a cortical adenoma may be a part of
multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN-I) in which
patients have associated adenomas of parathyroid, islet cells
and anterior pituitary (page 829).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, an adenoma is
usually a small, solitary, spherical and encapsulated
tumour which is well-delineated from the surrounding
normal adrenal gland. Cut section is typically bright
yellow.
Microscopically, the tumour cells are arranged in
trabeculae and generally resemble the cells of zona
fasciculata. Less frequently, the cells of adenoma are like
those of zona glomerulosa or zona reticularis.
Cortical Carcinoma
Carcinoma of the adrenal cortex is an uncommon tumour
occurring mostly in adults. It invades locally as well as
spreads to distant sites. Most cortical carcinomas secrete one
of the adrenocortical hormones excessively.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, an adrenal
carcinoma is generally large, spherical and well-
demarcated tumour. On cut section, it is predominantly
yellow with intermixed areas of haemorrhages, necrosis
and calcification.
Microscopically, the cortical carcinoma may vary from
well-differentiated to anaplastic growth. Well-
differentiated carcinoma consists of foci of atypia in an
adenoma, while anaplastic carcinoma shows large,
pleomorphic and bizarre cells with high mitotic activity.
MEDULLARY TUMOURS
The most significant lesions of the adrenal medulla are
neoplasms. These include the following:
Benign tumours: These are less common and include
pheochromocytoma and myelolipoma.
Tumours arising from embryonic nerve cells: These are more
common and include neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma.
These tumours together with extra-adrenal paragang-
lioma are described below.
Pheochromocytoma (Chromaffin Tumour)
Pheochromocytoma (meaning dusky brown tumour) is
generally a benign tumour arising from the pheochromocytes
(i.e. chromaffin cells) of the adrenal medulla. The extra-
adrenal pheochromocytomas arising from other paraganglia
are preferably called paragangliomas, named along with the
anatomic site of origin, as described later.
Pheochromocytoma may occur at any age but most
patients are 20-60 years old. Most pheochromocytomas are
slow-growing and benign but about 5% of the tumours are
malignant, invasive and metastasising. These tumours are
commonly sporadic but 10-20% are associated with familial
syndromes of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) having
bilaterality and association with medullary carcinoma of the
thyroid, hyperparathyroidism, pituitary adenoma, mucosal

800
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
neuromas and von Recklinghausen’s neurofibromatosis in
varying combinations.
The clinical features of pheochromocytoma are
predominantly due to secretion of catecholamines, both
epinephrine and norepinephrine. The most common feature
is hypertension. Other manifestations due to sudden release
of catecholamines are congestive heart failure, myocardial
infarction, pulmonary oedema, cerebral haemorrhage, and
even death. The diagnosis is established by measuring 24-
hour urinary catecholamines or their metabolites such as
metanephrine and VMA.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
soft, spherical, may be quite variable in size and weight,
and well-demarcated from the adjacent adrenal gland. On
cut section, the tumour is grey to dusky brown with areas
of haemorrhages, necrosis, calcification and cystic change
(Fig. 27.3). On immersing the tumour in dichromate
fixative, it turns brown-black due to oxidation of
catecholamines in the tumour and hence the name
chromaffin tumour.
Microscopically, the tumour has the following
characteristics (Fig. 27.4):
1.
The tumour cells are arranged characteristically as
well-defined nests (also termed as zellballen pattern)
separated by abundant fibrovascular stroma.
 2. Other arrangements are as solid columns, sheets,
trabeculae or clumps.
3.
The tumour cells are large, polyhedral and
pleomorphic with abundant granular amphophilic or
basophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei.
4.
The tumour cells of pheochromocytoma stain
positively with neuroendocrine substances such as
neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and chromogranin.
About 10% of pheochromcytomas may be malignant
having tendency for osseous metastases.
Myelolipoma
Myelolipoma is an uncommon benign adrenal medullary
tumour found incidentally at autopsy. Less often, it may
produce symptoms due to excessive hormone elaboration.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, a myelolipoma
is usually a small tumour, measuring 0.2-2 cm in diameter.
Microscopically, it consists of well-differentiated adipose
tissue in which is scattered clumps of haematopoietic cells
are seen.
Neuroblastoma
Neuroblastoma, also called as sympathicoblastoma, is a
common malignant tumour of embryonic nerve cells,
occurring most commonly in children under 5 years of age.
Vast majority of cases occur within the abdomen (in the
adrenal medulla and paravertebral autonomic ganglia) and
rarely in the cerebral hemisphere. Most cases are sporadic
but familial occurrence with autosomal dominant trans-
mission is also seen.
The clinical manifestations of neuroblastoma are related
to its rapid local growth, metastatic spread or development
of hormonal syndrome. Local symptoms include abdominal
distension, fever, weight loss and malaise. Foci of calcification
may be observed on radiologic examination of the abdomen.
Metastatic spread occurs early and widely through
haematogenous as well as lymphatic routes and involves
bones (especially skull), liver, lungs and regional lymph
nodes. Neuroblastoma produces variable amounts of
catecholamines and its metabolites such as vanillyl mandelic
acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), which can be
detected in the 24-hour urine. Less often, the patient develops
carcinoid-like syndrome, probably due to production of
kinins or prostaglandins by the tumour. The features in such
a case include watery diarrhoea, flushing of the skin and

CHAPTER 27
The Endocrine System
hypokalaemia. Rarely, the tumour may produce sufficient
catecholamines to cause hypertension.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
generally large, soft and lobulated mass with extensive
areas of necrosis and haemorrhages. The tumour is usually
diffusely infiltrating into the adjacent tissues. Cut surface
of the tumour is grey white and may reveal minute foci of
calcification.
Microscopically, neuroblastoma has the following
characteristics (Fig. 27.5):
1.
The tumour cells are small, round and oval, slightly
larger than lymphocytes, and have scanty and poorly-
defined cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei.
2.
They are generally arranged in irregular sheets
separated by fibrovascular stroma.
3.
Classical neuroblastomas show Homer-Wright’s
rosettes (pseudorosettes) which have a central fibrillar
eosinophilic material surrounded by radially arranged
tumour cells. The central fibrillar material stains positively
by silver impregnation methods indicating their nature
as young nerve fibrils.
4.
The tumour cells stain positively with immuno-
histochemical markers such as neuron-specific enolase
(NSE), neurofilaments (NF) and chromogranin.
Prognosis of neuroblastoma depends upon a few
variables:
i) Age of the child below 2 years is associated with better
prognosis.
ii)  Extra-abdominal location of the tumour have better outlook
than abdominal masses.
iii) Patients in clinical stage I (confined to the organ of origin)
or stage II (tumour extending in continuity beyond the organ
of origin but not crossing the midline) have better prognosis
than higher stages with distant metastases.
iv) Tumours with amplification of MYC oncogene and p53
are associated with poor prognosis.
Ganglioneuroma
A ganglioneuroma is a mature, benign and uncommon
tumour occurring in adults. It is derived from ganglion cells,
most often in the posterior mediastinum, and uncommonly
in other peripheral ganglia and brain. The tumour produces
symptoms because of its size and location. Catecholamines
and their metabolites can be detected in large amounts in
the 24-hour urine specimen of patients with ganglioneuroma.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
spherical, firm and encapsulated.
Microscopically, it contains large number of well-formed
ganglionic nerve cells scattered in fibrillar stroma and
myelinated and non-myelinated nerve fibres.
Extra-adrenal Paraganglioma (Chemodectoma)
Parasympathetic paraganglia located in extra-adrenal sites
such as the carotid bodies, vagus, jugulotympanic and
aorticosympathetic (pre-aortic) paraganglia may produce
neoplasms, collectively termed paragangliomas with the
anatomic site of origin e.g. carotid body paraganglioma,
intravagal paraganglioma, jugulotympanic paraganglioma
etc. These tumours are also called chemodectomas because
of their responsiveness to chemoreceptors. They are
uncommon tumours found in adults and rarely secrete excess
of catecholamines, except aorticosympathetic paraganglioma
(also termed extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma). Para-
gangliomas are generally benign but recurrent tumours. A
small proportion of them may metastasise widely.
THYROID GLAND
NORMAL STRUCTURE
ANATOMY. Embryologically, the thyroid gland arises
from a midline invagination at the root of the tongue and
grows downwards in front of trachea and thyroid cartilage
to reach its normal position. Failure to descent may produce
Figure 27.5
Neuroblastoma, It shows small, round to oval cells forming irregular sheets separated by fibrovascular stroma. A few Homer-
Wright’s pseudorosettes are also present. Inset shows a close-up view of pseudorosette.

802
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
anomalous lingual thyroid. The thyroglossal duct that
connects the gland to the pharyngeal floor normally
disappears by 6th week of embryonic life. In adults, its
proximal end is represented by foramen caecum at the base
of the tongue and distal end by the pyramidal lobe of the
thyroid. Persistence of the remnants of thyroglossal duct in
the adults may develop into thyroglossal cyst (page 520). The
C-cells of the thyroid originate from the neuroectoderm.
The thyroid gland in an adult weighs 15-40 gm and is
composed of two lateral lobes connected in the midline by
a broad isthmus which may have a pyramidal lobe
extending upwards. Cut section of normal thyroid is
yellowish and translucent.
HISTOLOGY. The thyroid is composed of lobules of colloid-
filled spherical follicles or acini. The lobules are enclosed by
fibrovascular septa. The follicles are the main functional units
of the thyroid. They are lined by cuboidal epithelium with
numerous fine microvilli extending into the follicular colloid
that contains the glycoprotein, thyroglobulin. The follicles are
separated from each other by delicate fibrous tissue that
contains blood vessels, lymphatics and nerves. Calcitonin-
secreting C-cells or parafollicular cells are dispersed within
the follicles and can only be identified by silver stains and
immunohistochemical methods.
FUNCTIONS. The major function of the thyroid gland is to
maintain a high rate of metabolism which is done by means
of iodine-containing thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and
tri-iodothyronine (T3).
The thyroid is one of the most labile organs in the body
and responds to numerous stimuli such as puberty,
pregnancy, physiologic stress and various pathologic states.
This functional lability of the thyroid is responsible for
transient hyperplasia of the thyroidal epithelium. Under
normal conditions, the epithelial lining of the follicles may
show changes in various phases of function as under:
1.
Resting phase is characterised by large follicles lined by
flattened cells and filled with deeply staining homogeneous
colloid e.g. in colloid goitre and iodine-treated hyper-
thyroidism.
2.
Secretory phase in which the follicles are lined by
cuboidal epithelium and the colloid is moderately dark pink
e.g. in normal thyroid.
3.
Resorptive phase is characterised by follicles lined by
columnar epithelium and containing lightly stained
vacuolated and scalloped colloid e.g. in hyperthyroidism.
The synthesis and release of the two main circulating
thyroid hormones, T3 and T4 are regulated by hypophyseal
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and involves the
following steps:
1.
Iodine trapping by thyroidal cells involves absorbing of
iodine from the blood and concentrating it more than twenty-
fold.
2.
Oxidation of the iodide takes place within the cells by a
thyroid peroxidase.
3.
Iodination occurs next, at the microvilli level between
the oxidised iodine and the tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin
so as to form mono-iodotyrosine (MIT) and di-iodotyrosine
(DIT).
4.
Coupling of MIT and DIT in the presence of thyroid
peroxidase forms tri-iodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4).
The thyroid hormones so formed are released by
endocytosis of colloid and proteolysis of thyroglobulin within
the follicular cells resulting in discharge of T3 and T4 into
circulation where they are bound to thyroxine-binding
globulin.
A number of thyroid function tests are currently available.
These include the following:
Determination of serum levels of T3, T4 by radio-
immunoassay (RIA).
TSH and TRH determination.
Determination of calcitonin secreted by parafollicular C
cells.
Estimation  of thyroglobulin secreted by thyroid follicular
cells.
Assessment of thyroid activity by its ability to uptake
radioactive iodine (RAIU).
Assessment whether thyroid lesion is a nonfunctioning
(‘cold nodule’) or hyperactive mass (‘hot nodule’).
Diseases of the thyroid include: functional disorders
(hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism), thyroiditis, Graves’
disease, goitre and tumours. The relative frequency of some
of these diseases varies in different geographic regions
according to the iodine content of the diet consumed. One of
the important investigation tools available in current times
is the widespread use of FNAC for thyroid lesions which
helps in avoiding a large number of unwanted diagnostic
biopsies.
FUNCTIONAL DISORDERS
Two significant functional disorders characterised by distinct
clinical syndromes are described. These are: hyperthyroidism
(thyrotoxicosis) and hypothyroidism.
HYPERTHYROIDISM (THYROTOXICOSIS)
Hyperthyroidism, also called thyrotoxicosis, is a hyper-
metabolic clinical and biochemical state caused by excess
production of thyroid hormones. The condition is more
frequent in females and is associated with rise in both T3
and T4 levels in blood, though the increase in T3 is generally
greater than that of T4.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Hyperthyroidism may be caused
by many diseases but three most common causes are: Graves’
disease (diffuse toxic goitre), toxic multinodular goitre and
a toxic adenoma. Less frequent causes are hypersecretion of
pituitary TSH by a pituitary tumour, hypersecretion of TRH,
thyroiditis, metastatic tumours of the thyroid, struma ovarii,
congenital hyperthyroidism in the newborn of mother with
Graves’ disease, hCG-secreting tumours due to mild
thyrotropic effects of hCG (e.g. hydatidiform mole, chorio-
carcinoma and testicular tumours), and lastly, by excessive
doses of thyroid hormones or iodine called jodbasedow disease.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Patients with hyperthyroidism have
a slow and insidious onset, varying in severity from case to
case. The usual symptoms are emotional instability,

803
CHAPTER 27
The Endocrine System
nervousness, palpitation, fatigue, weight loss in spite of good
appetite, heat intolerance, perspiration, menstrual
disturbances and fine tremors of the outstretched hands.
Cardiac manifestations in the form of tachycardia,
palpitations and cardiomegaly are invariably present in
hyperthyroidism. The skin of these patients is warm, moist
and flushed. Weakness of skeletal muscles and osteoporosis
are common. Typical eye changes in the form of exoph-
thalmos are a common feature in Graves’ disease. Serum
levels of T3 and T4 are elevated but TSH secretion is usually
inhibited.
A sudden spurt in the severity of hyperthyroidism termed
‘thyroid storm’ or ‘thyroid crisis’ may occur in patients who
have undergone subtotal thyroidectomy before adequate
control of hyperthyroid state, or in a hyperthyroid patient
under acute stress, trauma, and with severe infection. These
patients develop high grade fever, tachycardia, cardiac
arrhythmias and coma and may die of congestive heart
failure or hyperpyrexia.
HYPOTHYROIDISM
Hypothyroidism is a hypometabolic clinical state resulting
from inadequate production of thyroid hormones for
prolonged periods, or rarely, from resistance of the peripheral
tissues to the effects of thyroid hormones. The clinical
manifestations of hypothyroidism, depending upon the age
at onset of disorder, are divided into 2 forms:
1.
Cretinism or congenital hypothyroidism is the development
of severe hypothyroidism during infancy and childhood.
2.
Myxoedema is the adulthood hypothyroidism.
Cretinism
A cretin is a child with severe hypothyroidism present at
birth or developing within first two years of postnatal life.
This is the period when brain development is taking place;
in the absence of treatment the child is both physically and
mentally retarded. The word ‘Cretin’ is derived from the
French, meaning Christ-like because these children are so
mentally retarded that they are incapable of committing sins.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The causes of congenital
hypothyroidism are as follows:
1.
Developmental anomalies e.g. thyroid agenesis and ectopic
thyroid.
2.
Genetic defect in thyroid hormone synthesis e.g. defect in
iodine trapping, oxidation, iodination, coupling and
thyroglobulin synthesis.
3.
Foetal exposure to iodides and antithyroid drugs.
4.
Endemic cretinism in regions with endemic goitre due to
dietary lack of iodine (sporadic cretinism, on the other hand,
is due to developmental anomalies and genetic defects in
thyroid hormone synthesis described above).
CLINICAL FEATURES. The clinical manifestations usually
become evident within a few weeks to months of birth. The
presenting features of a cretin are: slow to thrive, poor
feeding, constipation, dry scaly skin, hoarse cry and
bradycardia. As the child ages, clinical picture of fully-
developed cretinism emerges characterised by impaired
skeletal growth and consequent dwarfism, round face,
narrow forehead, widely-set eyes, flat and broad nose, big
protuberant tongue and protuberant abdomen. Neurological
features such as deaf-mutism, spasticity and mental
deficiency are more evident in sporadic cretinism due to
developmental anomalies and dyshormonogenetic defects.
Characteristic laboratory findings include a rise in TSH
level and fall in T3 and T4 levels.
Myxoedema
The adult-onset severe hypothyroidism causes myxoedema.
The term myxoedema connotes non-pitting oedema due to
accumulation of hydrophilic mucopolysaccharides in the
ground substance of dermis and other tissues.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. There are several causes of
myxoedema listed below but the first two are the most
common causes:
1.
Ablation of the thyroid by surgery or radiation.
2.
Autoimmune (lymphocytic) thyroiditis (termed primary
idiopathic myxoedema).
3.
Endemic or sporadic goitre.
4.
Hypothalamic-pituitary lesions.
5.
Thyroid cancer.
6.
Prolonged administration of antithyroid drugs.
7.
Mild developmental anomalies and dyshormonogenesis.
Figure 27.6
Appearance in functional disorders of the thyroid gland.

804
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
CLINICAL FEATURES. The onset of myxoedema is slow
and a fully-developed clinical syndrome may appear after
several years of hypothyroidism. The striking features are
cold intolerance, mental and physical lethargy, constipation,
slowing of speech and intellectual function, puffiness of face,
loss of hair and altered texture of the skin.
The laboratory diagnosis in myxoedema is made by low
serum T3 and T4 levels and markedly elevated TSH levels as
in the case of cretinism but cases with suprathyroid lesions
(hypothalamic-pituitary disease) have low TSH levels.
The clinical appearance of these three major forms of
functional disorders of the thyroid gland is shown in
Fig. 27.6.
THYROIDITIS
Inflammation of the thyroid, thyroiditis, is more often due
to non-infectious causes and is classified on the basis of onset
and duration of disease into acute, subacute and chronic as
under:
I.
Acute thyroiditis:
1. Bacterial infection e.g. Staphylococcus, Streptococcus.
2. Fungal infection e.g. Aspergillus, Histoplasma, Pneumocystis.
3. Radiation injury
II. Subacute thyroiditis:
1. Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (de Quervain’s
thyroiditis, giant cell thyroiditis, viral thyroiditis)
2. Subacute lymphocytic (postpartum, silent) thyroiditis
3. Tuberculous thyroiditis
III. Chronic thyroiditis:
1. Autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or
chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis)
2. Riedel’s thyroiditis (or invasive fibrous thyroiditis).
While acute infectious thyroiditis is uncommon, some of
the morphologically important forms of thyroiditis from the
above list are discussed below.
HASHIMOTO’S (AUTOIMMUNE,
CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC) THYROIDITIS
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, also called diffuse lymphocytic
thyroiditis, struma lymphomatosa or goitrous autoimmune
thyroiditis, is characterised by 3 principal features:
1. Diffuse goitrous enlargement of the thyroid.
2. Lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland.
3. Occurrence of  thyroid autoantibodies.
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis occurs more frequently between
the age of 30 and 50 years and shows an approximately ten-
fold preponderance among females. Though rare in children,
about half the cases of adolescent goitre are owing to
autoimmune thyroiditis. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is the most
common cause of goitrous hypothyroidism in regions where
iodine supplies are adequate. Regions where iodine intake is
highest have higher incidence of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis e.g.
in Japan and the United States.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is an
autoimmune disease is well established. Hashimoto, a
Japanese surgeon, described it in 1912 as the first auto-
immune disease of any organ. Autoimmune pathogenesis
of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is explained by the following
observations:
1.
Other autoimmune disease association: Like in other
autoimmune diseases, Hashimoto’s disease has been found
in association with other autoimmune diseases such as
Graves’ disease, SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome, rheumatoid
arthritis, pernicious anaemia and Type 1 diabetes mellitus.
2. Immune destruction of thyroid cells: The sequence of
immune phenomena is initial activation of CD4+ T helper
cells. These cells then induce infiltration of CD8+ T cytotoxic
cells in the thyroid parenchyma as well as activate B cells to
form autoantibodies, which bring about immune destruction
of thyroid parenchyma.
3.
Detection of autoantibodies: The following autoanti-
bodies against different thyroid cell antigens are detectable
in the sera of most patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis:
i) Thyroid microsomal autoantibodies (against the
microsomes of the follicular cells).
ii) Thyroglobulin autoantibodies.
iii) TSH receptor autoantibodies.
iv) Less constantly found are thyroid autoantibodies against
follicular cell membranes, thyroid hormones themselves, and
colloid component other than thyroglobulin.
4. Inhibitory TSH-receptor antibodies:  TSH-receptor
antibody seen on the surface of thyroid cells in Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis is inhibitory to TSH, producing hypothyroidism.
Similar antibody is observed in Graves’ disease where it
causes hyperthyroidism. It appears that TSH-receptor
antibody may act both to depress or stimulate the thyroid
cells to produce hypo- or hyperthyroidism respectively. Thus,
these patients may have alternate episodes of hypo- or
hyperthyroidism.
5. Genetic basis: The disease has higher incidence in first-
degree relatives of affected patients. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
is seen more often with HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR5 subtypes.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Pathologically, two
varieties of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis are seen: classic form,
the usual and more common, and fibrosing variant found
in only 10% cases of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.
Grossly, the classic form is characterised by diffuse,
symmetric, firm and rubbery enlargement of the thyroid
which may weigh 100-300 gm. Sectioned surface of the
thyroid is fleshly with accentuation of normal lobulations
but with retained normal shape of the gland. The fibrosing
variant has a firm, enlarged thyroid with compression of
the surrounding tissues.
Histologically, the classic form shows the following
features (Fig. 27.7):
1.
There is extensive infiltration of the gland by
lymphocytes, plasma cells, immunoblasts and macro-
phages, with formation of lymphoid follicles having
germinal centres.
2.
There is decreased number of thyroid follicles which
are generally atrophic and are often devoid of colloid.
3.
The follicular epithelial cells are transformed into their
degenerated state termed Hurthle cells (also called

805
CHAPTER 27
The Endocrine System
Askanazy cells, or oxyphil cells, or oncocytes). These cells
have abundant oxyphilic or eosinophilic and granular
cytoplasm due to large number of mitochondria and
contain large bizarre nuclei.
4. There is slight fibrous thickening of the septa separating
the thyroid lobules.
The less common fibrosing variant of Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis shows considerable fibrous replacement of
thyroid parenchyma and a less prominent lymphoid
infiltrate.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The presenting feature of
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is a painless, firm and moderate
goitrous enlargement of the thyroid gland, usually associated
with hypothyroidism, in an elderly woman. At this stage,
serum T3 and T4 levels are decreased and RAIU is also
reduced. A few cases, however, develop hyperthyroidism,
termed hashitoxicosis, further substantiating the similarities
in the autoimmune phenomena between Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis and Graves’ thyrotoxicosis. There is no increased
risk of developing thyroid carcinoma in Hashimoto’s thyroi-
ditis but there is increased frequency of malignant lymphoma
in these cases.
SUBACUTE LYMPHOCYTIC THYROIDITIS
Subacute lymphocytic (or painless or silent or postpartum)
thyroiditis is another variety of autoimmune thyrioditis.
Clinically, it differs from subacute granulomatous thyroiditis
in being non-tender thyroid enlargement. It is seen more often
3-6 months after delivery.
Microscopically, the features are as under:
1.
Dense multifocal infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma
cells in the parenchyma.
2.
Collapse of thyroid follicles.
3.
Rarely, presence of lymphoid follicles with germinal
centres, simulating Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.
SUBACUTE GRANULOMATOUS (DE QUERVAIN’S)
THYROIDITIS
Granulomatous thyroiditis, also called de Quervain’s or
subacute, or giant cell thyroiditis, is a distinctive form of self-
limited inflammation of the thyroid gland. Etiology of the
condition is not known but clinical features of a prodromal
phase and preceding respiratory infection suggest a possible
viral etiology. The disease is more common in young and
middle-aged women and may present clinically with painful
moderate thyroid enlargement with fever, features of hyper-
thyroidism in the early phase of the disease, and
hypothyroidism if the damage to the thyroid gland is exten-
sive. The condition is self-limiting and shows complete
recovery of thyroid function in about 6 months.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, there is moderate
enlargement of the gland which is often asymmetric or
focal. The cut surface of the involved area is firm and
yellowish-white.
Microscopically, the features vary according to the stage
of the disease:
Initially, there is acute inflammatory destruction of the
thyroid parenchyma and formation of microabscesses.
Later, the more characteristic feature of granulomatous
appearance is produced. These granulomas consist of
central colloid material surrounded by histiocytes and
scattered multinucleate giant cells.
More advanced cases may show fibroblastic proli-
feration.
Morphologically similar appearance may be produced
in cases where vigorous thyroid palpation may initiate
mechanical trauma to follicles, so-called palpation thyroiditis.
RIEDEL’S  THYROIDITIS
Riedel’s thyroiditis, also called Riedel’s struma or invasive
fibrous thyroiditis, is a rare chronic disease characterised by
Figure 27.7
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Histologic features include: lymphoid cell infiltration with formation of lymphoid follicles having germinal
centres; small, atrophic and colloid-deficient follicles; presence of Hurthle cells which have granular oxyphil cytoplasm and large irregular nuclei;
and slight fibrous thickening of lobular septa.

806
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
stony-hard thyroid that is densely adherent to the adjacent
structures in the neck. The condition is clinically significant
due to compressive clinical features (e.g. dysphagia,
dyspnoea, recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis and stridor)
and resemblance with thyroid cancer. Riedel’s struma is seen
more commonly in females in 4th to 7th decades of life. The
etiology is unknown but possibly Riedel’s thyroiditis is a part
of multifocal idiopathic fibrosclerosis (page 591). This group of
disorders includes: idiopathic retroperitoneal, mediastinal
and retro-orbital fibrosis, and sclerosing cholangitis, all of
which may occur simultaneously with Riedel’s thyroiditis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the thyroid gland
is usually contracted, stony-hard, asymmetric and firmly
adherent to the adjacent structures. Cut section is hard
and devoid of lobulations.
Microscopically, there is extensive fibrocollagenous
replacement, marked atrophy of the thyroid parenchyma,
focally scattered lymphocytic infiltration and invasion of
the adjacent muscle tissue by the process.
GRAVES’ DISEASE (DIFFUSE TOXIC GOITRE)
Graves’ disease, also known as Basedow’s disease, primary
hyperplasia, exophthalmic goitre, and diffuse toxic goitre, is
characterised by a triad of features:
Hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis)
Diffuse thyroid enlargement
Ophthalmopathy.
The disease is more frequent between the age of 30 and
40 years and has five-fold increased prevalence among
females.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Graves’ disease is an autoimmune
disease and, as already stated, there are many immunologic
similarities between this condition and Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis. These are as follows:
1.
Genetic factor association. Like in Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis. Graves’disease too has genetic predisposition. A
familial occurrence has been observed. Susceptibility to
develop Graves’ disease has been found associated with
HLA-DR3 (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis has both HLA-DR3 and
HLA-DR5 association, page 804), CTLA-4 and PTPN22
(a T-cell regulatory gene).
2.
Autoimmune disease association. Graves’ disease may
be found in association with other organ-specific auto-
immune diseases. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and Graves’
disease are frequently present in the same families and the
two diseases may coexist in the same patient.
3.
Other factors. Besides these two factors, Graves’ disease
has higher prevalence in women (7 to 10 times), and
association with emotional stress and smoking.
4.
Autoantibodies. Autoantibodies against thyroid antigens
are detectable in the serum of these patients too but their
sites of action are different from that of Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis. In Graves’ disease, TSH-receptor autoantigen is
the main antigen against which autoantibodies are directed.
These are as under:
i)
Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI): It binds to TSH
receptor and stimulates increased release of thyroid hormone.
ii) Thyroid growth-stimulating immunoglobulins (TGI): It
stimulates proliferation of follicular epithelium.
iii) TSH-binding inhibitor immunoglobulins (TBII): It is
inhibitory to binding of TSH to its own receptor. Depending
upon its action as inhibitory or stimulatory to follicular
epithelium, it may result in alternate episodes of hypo- and
hyperthyroidism.
However, it is not quite clear what stimulates B cells to
form these autoantibodies in Graves’ disease. Possibly,
intrathyroidal CD4+ helper T cells are responsible for
stimulating B cells to secrete autoantibodies.
The pathogenesis of Graves’ infiltrative ophthalmopathy
is also of autoimmune origin. The evidence in support is the
intense lymphocytic infiltrate around the ocular muscles and
detection of circulating autoantibodies against muscle
antigen that cross-react with thyroid microsomes.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the thyroid is
moderately, diffusely and symmetrically enlarged and
may weigh up to 70-90 gm. On cut section, the thyroid
parenchyma is typically homogeneous, red-brown and
meaty and lacks the normal translucency.
Histologically, the following features are found (Fig. 27.8):
1.
There is considerable epithelial hyperplasia and

lining cells and formation of papillary infoldings of piled
up epithelium into the lumina of follicles which are small.

administration results in accumulation of colloid in the
follicles and decrease in vascularity and height of follicular
cells, while antithyroid drugs such as thiouracil cause marked
hyperplasia.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Graves’ disease generally develops
slowly and insidiously.
Patients are usually young women who present with
symmetric, moderate enlargement of the thyroid gland with
features of thyrotoxicosis (page 802), ophthalmopathy and
dermatopathy.
Ocular abnormalities are lid lag, upper lid retraction, stare,
weakness of eye muscles and proptosis. In extreme cases,
the lids can no longer close and may produce corneal injuries
and ulcerations.
Dermatopathy in Graves’ disease most often consists of
pretibial (localised) myxoedema in the form of firm plaques.
Like in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, there is no increased risk
of development of thyroid cancer in Graves’ disease.
GOITRE
The term goitre is defined as thyroid enlargement caused by
compensatory hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the follicular
epithelium in response to thyroid hormone deficiency. The
end-result of this hyperplasia is generally a euthyroid state
(in contrast to thyrotoxicosis occurring in diffuse toxic goitre
or Graves’ disease) though at some stages there may be hypo-
or hyperthyroidism. Two morphologic forms of goitre are
distinguished:
A. Diffuse goitre (simple nontoxic goitre or colloid goitre).
B. Nodular goitre (multinodular goitre or adenomatous
goitre).
Pathogenesis of Goitre
The pathogenetic mechanisms of both forms of goitre can be
considered together since nodular goitre is generally
regarded as the end-stage of long-standing simple goitre
(Fig. 27.9). The fundamental defect is deficient production
of thyroid hormones due to various etiologic factors
described below, but most common is dietary lack of iodine.
Deficient thyroid hormone production causes excessive TSH
stimulation which leads to hyperplasia of follicular
epithelium as well as formation of new thyroid follicles.
Cyclical hyperplastic stage followed by involution stage
completes the picture of simple goitre. Repeated and
prolonged changes of hyperplasia result in continued growth
of thyroid tissue while involuted areas undergo fibrosis, thus
completing the picture of nodular goitre.
Diffuse Goitre
(Simple Non-toxic Goitre, Colloid Goitre)
Diffuse, nontoxic simple or colloid goitre is the name given
to diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland, unaccompanied
by hyperthyroidism. Most cases are in a state of euthyroid
though they may have passed through preceding stage of
hypothyroidism due to inadequate supply of iodine. TSH
levels are invariably elevated. In general, goitre is more
common in females. Simple goitre often appears at puberty
or in adolescence, following which it may either regress or
may progress to nodular goitre.
ETIOLOGY. Epidemiologically, goitre occurs in 2 forms:
endemic, and non-endemic or sporadic.
Endemic goitre. Prevalence of goitre in a geographic area in
more than 10% of the population is termed endemic goitre.
Such endemic areas are several high mountainous regions
far from the sea where iodine content of drinking water and
food is low such as in the regions of the Himalayas, the Alps
and the Ande. Of late, however, the prevalence in these areas
has declined due to prophylactic use of iodised salt.
Though most endemic goitres are caused by dietary lack
of iodine, some cases occur due to goitrogens and genetic
factors. Goitrogens are substances which interfere with the
synthesis of thyroid hormones. These substances are drugs
used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism and certain items
of food such as cabbage, cauliflower, turnips and cassava
roots.
Sporadic (non-endemic) goitre. Non-endemic or sporadic
simple goitre is less common than the endemic variety. In
most cases, the etiology of sporadic goitre is unknown. A
number of causal influences have been attributed. These
include the following:
Suboptimal iodine intake in conditions of increased
demand as in puberty and pregnancy.
Figure 27.9

808
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Genetic factors.
Dietary goitrogenes.
Hereditary defect in thyroid hormone synthesis and
transport (dyshormonogenesis).
Inborn errors of iodine metabolism.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the enlargement
of the thyroid gland in simple goitre is moderate (weighing
up to 100-150 gm), symmetric and diffuse. Cut surface is
gelatinous and translucent brown (Fig. 27.10).
Histologically, two stages are distinguished:
1.
Hyperplastic stage is the early stage and is characterised
by tall columnar follicular epithelium showing papillary
infoldings and formation of small new follicles.
2.
Involution stage generally follows hyperplastic stage
after variable period of time. This stage is characterised
by large follicles distended by colloid and lined by
flattened follicular epithelium (Fig. 27.11).
Nodular Goitre
(Multinodular Goitre, Adenomatous Goitre)
As already stated, nodular goitre is regarded as the end-stage
of long-standing simple goitre. It is characterised by most
extreme degree of tumour-like enlargement of the thyroid
gland and characteristic nodularity. The enlargement of the
gland may be sufficient to not only cause cosmetic
disfigurement, but in many cases may cause dsyphagia and
choking due to compression of oesophagus and trachea. Most
cases are in a euthyroid state but about 10% cases may
develop thyrotoxicosis resulting in toxic nodular goitre or
Plummer’s disease. However, thyrotoxicosis of Plummer’s
disease (toxic nodular goitre) differs from that of Graves’
disease (diffuse toxic goitre) in lacking features of ophthalmo-
pathy and dermatopathy. Such ‘hot nodules’ may be picked
up by CT scan or by RAIU studies. Since nodular goitre is
derived from simple goitre, it has the same female

The Endocrine System
preponderance but affects older individuals because it is a
late complication of simple goitre.
ETIOLOGY. Etiologic factors implicated in endemic and non-
endemic or sporadic variety of simple goitre are involved in
the etiology of nodular goitre too. However, how nodular
pattern is produced is not clearly understood. Possibly,
epithelial hyperplasia, generation of new follicles, and
irregular accumulation of colloid in the follicles—all
contribute to produce increased tension and stress in the
thyroid gland causing rupture of follicles and vessels. This
is followed by haemorrhages, scarring and sometimes
calcification, resulting in development of nodular pattern.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the thyroid in
nodular goitre shows asymmetric and extreme
enlargement, weighing 100-500 gm or even more. The five
cardinal macroscopic features are as under (Fig. 27.12):
1.
Nodularity with poor encapsulation
2.
Fibrous scarring
3.
Haemorrhages
4.
Focal calcification
5.
Cystic degeneration.
Cut surface generally shows multinodularity but
occasionally there may be only one or two nodules which
are poorly-circumscribed (unlike complete encapsulation
of thyroid adenoma, described below).
Histologically, the same heterogenicity as seen on gross
appearance is seen. Corresponding microscopic features
are as follows (Fig. 27.13):
1.
Partial or incomplete encapsulation of nodules.
2.
The follicles varying from small to large and lined by
flat to high epithelium. A few may show macropapillary

Systemic Pathology
The contrasting features of diffuse and nodular goitre
are summarised in Table 27.2.
THYROID TUMOURS
Most primary tumours of the thyroid are of follicular
epithelial origin; a few arise from parafollicular C-cells. The
most common benign thyroid neoplasm is a follicular
adenoma. Malignant tumours of the thyroid are less common
but thyroid carcinoma is the most common type, though
rarely lymphomas and sarcomas also occur.
FOLLICULAR ADENOMA
Follicular adenoma is the most common benign thyroid
tumour occurring more frequently in adult women.
Clinically, it appears as a solitary nodule which can be found
in approximately 1% of the population. Besides the follicular
adenoma, other conditions which may produce clinically
apparent solitary nodule in the thyroid are a dominant
nodule of nodular goitre and thyroid carcinoma. It is thus
important to distinguish adenomas from these two
conditions. Though most adenomas cause no clinical problem
and behave as a ‘cold nodule’, rarely they may produce mild
hyperthyroidism and appear as ‘hot nodule’ on RAIU
studies. Adenoma, however, rarely ever becomes malignant.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the follicular
adenoma is characterised by four features so as to
distinguish it from a nodule of nodular goitre (Fig. 27.14):
1.
solitary nodule;
2.
complete encapsulation;
3.
clearly distinct architecture inside and outside the
capsule; and
4.
compression of the thyroid parenchyma outside the
capsule
Usually, an adenoma is small (up to 3 cm in diameter)
and spherical. On cut section, the adenoma is grey-white
to red-brown, less colloidal than the surrounding thyroid
parenchyma and may have degenerative changes such as
fibrous scarring, focal calcification, haemorrhages and cyst
formation.
Histologically, the tumour shows complete fibrous
encapsulation. The tumour cells are benign follicular
epithelial cells forming follicles of various sizes or may
show trabecular, solid and cord patterns with little follicle
formation. Accordingly, the following 6 types of growth
patterns are distinguished, though more than one pattern
may be present in a single tumour:
1.
Microfollicular (foetal) adenoma consists of small follicles
containing little or no colloid and separated by abundant
loose stroma (Fig. 27.15).
2.
Normofollicular (simple) adenoma has closely packed
follicles like that of normal thyroid gland.
3.
Macrofollicular (colloid) adenoma contains large follicles
of varying size and distended with colloid.
4.
Trabecular (embryonal) adenoma resembles embryonal
thyroid and consists of closely packed solid or trabecular
pattern of epithelial cells with an occasional small abortive
follicle.
5.
Hurthle cell (oxyphilic) adenoma is an uncommon variant
composed of solid trabeculae of large cells having
abundant granular oxyphilic cytoplasm and vesicular

nuclei. The tumour cells do not form follicles and contain
little stroma.
6.
Atypical adenoma is the term used for a follicular
adenoma which has more pronounced cellular prolife-
ration so that features may be considered indicative of
malignancy such as pleomorphism, increased mitoses and
nuclear atypia. These tumours, however, do not show
capsular and vascular invasion—features which
distinguish it from follicular carcinoma.
THYROID CANCER
Approximately 95% of all primary thyroid cancers are
carcinomas. Primary lymphomas of the thyroid comprise less
than 5% of thyroid cancers and majority of them possibly
evolve from autoimmune (lymphocytic) thyroiditis (page
804). Sarcomas of the thyroid are extremely rare. About 20%
of patients dying of metastasising malignancy have
metastatic deposits in the thyroid gland, most commonly
from malignant melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and
bronchogenic carcinoma.
In line with most other thyroid lesions, most carcinomas
of the thyroid too have female preponderance and are twice
more common in women.
Carcinoma of the thyroid gland has 4 major morphologic
types with distinctly different clinical behaviour and variable
prevalence. These are: papillary, follicular, medullary and
undifferentiated (anaplastic) carcinoma; their contrasting
features are summed up in Table 27.3.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Most important risk factor
implicated in the etiology of thyroid cancer is external
radiation, and to a some extent there is role of TSH receptors
and iodine excess, while pathogenesis of thyroid cancer is
explained on genetic alterations.
1. External radiation. The single most important
environmental factor associated with increased risk of
developing thyroid carcinoma after many years of exposure
to external radiation of high dose. Evidences in support
include: high incidence of thyroid cancer in individuals
irradiated in early age for enlarged thymus and for skin
disorders, in Japanese atomic bomb survivors, and in
individuals living in the vicinity of nuclear accident sites. In
particular, exposure to radiation to children and young adults
has been found to be associated with higher incidence of
development of papillary carcinoma later.
2.
Iodine excess and TSH. In regions where endemic goitre
is widespread, addition of iodine to diet has resulted in
increase in incidence of papillary cancer. Many well-
differentiated thyroid cancers express TSH receptors and thus
respond to T4 suppression of TSH.
3. Genetic basis. Familial clustering of thyroid cancer has
been observed, especially in medullary carcinoma. Molecular
studies reveal that thyroid carcinoma is a multistep process
involving genetic alterations but distinct mutations are seen
in different histologic types:
i) Papillary thyroid carcinoma:  Mutation in RET gene (gene
overexpression) located on chromosome 10q is seen in about
20% cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma. This mutation
renders the tyrosine kinase receptor under the target of other
tumour-promoting factors such as radiation exposure in
papillary carcinoma. Another genetic abnormality seen in
5-10% cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma is gene
rearrangement in NTRK1 (neurotrophic tyrosine kinase
receptor 1 located on chromosome 1q) gene.
ii) Follicular thyroid carcinoma: About 50% cases of follicular
thyroid carcinoma have mutation in RAS family of oncogenes
that includes HRAS, NRAS and KRAS. Besides, fusion-
translocation between 2 genes—PAX-8 (paired domain
transcription factor) and PPARγ-1 (gene coding for
peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor γ-1), has also been
described in a proportion of cases of follicular thyroid
neoplasms, both adenoma and carcinoma.
iii) Medullary thyroid carcinoma: Medullary thyroid carcinoma
arises from parafollicular C-cells in the thyroid. Point
mutation in RET-protooncogene  is seen in both familial as a
well as sporadiac cases of medullary thyroid carcinoma.
iv) Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: This tumour either arises from
further dedifferentiation of differentiated papillary or
follicular thyroid carcinoma, or by inactivating point
mutation in p53 tumour suppressor gene or by mutation in
gene coding for β-catenin pathway.
Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma
Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid
carcinoma, comprising 75-85% of cases. It can occur at all
ages including children and young adults but the incidence
is higher with advancing age. The tumour is found about
three times more frequently in females than in males.
Papillary carcinoma is typically a slow-growing
malignant tumour, most often presenting as an asymptomatic
solitary nodule. Involvement of the regional lymph nodes is
common but distant metastases to organs are rare. Some cases
first come to attention by spread to regional lymph nodes
and cause cervical lymphadenopathy. ‘Lateral aberrant thyroid’
is the term used for occurrence of thyroid tissue in the lateral
cervical lymph node, which in most patients represents a
well-differentiated metastasis of an occult papillary
carcinoma of the thyroid.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, papillary carci-
noma may range from microscopic foci to nodules upto
10 cm in diameter and is generally poorly delineated. Cut
surface of the tumour is greyish-white, hard and scar-like
(Fig. 27.16). Sometimes the tumour is transformed into a
cyst, into which numerous papillae project and is termed
papillary cystadenocarcinoma.
Figure 27.16
Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Cut surface of the
enlarged thyroid gland shows a single nodule separated from the rest of
thyroid parenchyma by incomplete fibrous septa (arrow). The nodule is
grey-white soft and shows grossly visible papillary pattern.

813
CHAPTER 27
The Endocrine System
Histologically, the following features are present
(Fig. 27.17):
1.
Papillary pattern. Papillae composed of fibrovascular
stalk and covered by single layer of tumour cells is the
predominant feature. Papillae are often accompanied by
follicles.
2.
Tumour cells. The tumour cells have characteristic
nuclear features due to dispersed nuclear chromatin
imparting it ground glass or optically clear appearance and
clear or oxyphilic cytoplasm. These tumour cells, besides
covering the papillae, may form follicles and solid sheets.
3.
Invasion. The tumour cells invade the capsule and
intrathyroid lymphatics but invasion of blood vessels is
rare.
4.
Psammoma bodies. Half of papillary carcinomas show
typical small, concentric, calcified spherules called
psammoma bodies in the stroma.
The prognosis of papillary carcinoma is good: 10-year
survival rate is 80-95%, irrespective of whether the tumour
is pure papillary or mixed papillary-follicular carcinoma.
Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma
Follicular carcinoma is the other common type of thyroid
cancer, next only to papillary carcinoma and comprises about
10-20% of all thyroid carcinomas. It is more common in
middle and old age and has preponderance in females
(female-male ratio 2.5:1). In contrast to papillary carcinoma,
follicular carcinoma has a positive correlation with endemic
goitre but the role of external radiation in its etiology is
unclear.
Follicular carcinoma presents clinically either as a solitary
nodule or as an irregular, firm and nodular thyroid
enlargement. The tumour is slow-growing but more rapid
than the papillary carcinoma. In contrast to papillary
carcinoma, regional lymph node metastases are rare but
distant metastases by haematogenous route are common,
especially to the lungs and bones.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, follicular carci-
noma may be either in the form of a solitary adenoma-
like circumscribed nodule or as an obvious cancerous
irregular thyroid enlargement. The cut surface of the
tumour is grey-white with areas of haemorrhages, necrosis
and cyst formation and may extend to involve adjacent
structures.
Microscopically, the features are as under (Fig. 27.18):
1. Follicular pattern: Follicular carcinoma, like follicular
adenoma, is composed of follicles of various sizes and may
show trabecular or solid pattern. The tumour cells have
hyperchromatic nuclei and the cytoplasm resembles that
of normal follicular cells. However, variants like clear cell
type and Hurthle cell (oxyphilic) type of follicular carcinoma
may occur. The tumour differs from papillary carcinoma
in lacking: papillae, ground-glass nuclei of tumour cells
and psammoma bodies.
2. Vascular invasion and direct extension: Vascular
invasion and direct extension to involve the adjacent
structures (e.g. into the capsule) are significant features
but lymphatic invasion is rare.
The prognosis of follicular carcinoma is between that of
papillary and undifferentiated carcinoma: 10-year survival
rate is 50-70%.
Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma
Medullary carcinoma is a less frequent type derived from
parafollicular or C-cells present in the thyroid and comprises
about 5% of thyroid carcinomas. It is equally common in men
and women. There are 3 distinctive features which
distinguish medullary carcinoma from the other thyroid
carcinomas. These are: its familial occurrence, secretion of
calcitonin and other peptides, and amyloid stroma.
1.
Familial occurrence. Most cases of medullary carcinoma
occur sporadically, but about 10% have a genetic background
with point mutation in RET-protooncogene located on
chromosome 10q. The familial form of medullary carcinoma

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
has association with pheochromocytoma and parathyroid
adenoma (multiple endocrine neoplasia, MEN II A), or with
pheochromocytoma and multiple mucosal neuromas (MEN
II B). The sporadic cases occur in the middle and old age
(5th-6th decades) and are generally unilateral, while the
familial cases are found at younger age (2nd-3rd decades)
and are usually bilateral and multicentric.
2.
Secretion of calcitonin and other peptides. Like normal
C-cells, tumour cells of medullary carcinoma secrete
calcitonin, the hypocalcaemic hormone. In addition, the
tumour may also elaborate prostaglandins, histaminase,
somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and ACTH.
These hormone elaborations are responsible for a number of
clinical syndromes such as carcinoid syndrome, Cushing’s
syndrome and diarrhoea.
3.
Amyloid stroma. Most medullary carcinomas have
amyloid deposits in the stroma which stains positively with
usual amyloid stains such as Congo red. The amyloid
deposits are believed to represent stored calcitonin derived
from neoplastic C-cells in the form of prohormone.
Most cases of medullary carcinoma present as solitary
thyroid nodule but sometimes an enlarged cervical lymph
node may be the first manifestation.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour may
either appear as a unilateral solitary nodule (sporadic form),
or have bilateral and multicentric involvement (familial
form). However, sporadic neoplasms also eventually
spread to the contralateral lobe. Cut surface of tumour in
both forms shows well-defined tumour areas which are
firm to hard, grey-white to yellow-brown with areas of
haemorrhages and necrosis.
Histologically, the features are as under (Fig. 27.19):
1.
Tumour cells: Like other neuroendocrine tumours (e.g.
carcinoid, islet cell tumour, paraganglioma etc), medullary
carcinoma of the thyroid too has a well-defined organoid
pattern, forming nests of tumour cells separated by
fibrovascular septa. Sometimes, the tumour cells may be
arranged in sheets, ribbons pseudopapillae or small
follicles. The tumour cells are uniform and have the
structural and functional characteristics of C-cells. Less
often, the neoplastic cells are spindle-shaped.
2. Amyloid stroma: The tumour cells are separated by
amyloid stroma derived from altered calcitonin which can
be demonstrated by immunostain for calcitonin. The
staining properties of amyloid are similar to that seen in
systemic amyloidosis and may have areas of irregular
calcification but without regular laminations seen in
psammoma bodies.
 3. C-cell hyperplasia: Familial cases generally have
C-cell hyperplasia as a precursor lesion but not in sporadic
cases.
Most medullary carcinomas are slow-growing. Regional
lymph node metastases may occur but distant organ
metastases are infrequent. The prognosis is better in familial
form than in the sporadic form: overall 10-year survival rate
is 60-70%.
Anaplastic Carcinoma
Undifferentiated or anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid
comprises less than 5% of all thyroid cancers and is one of
the most malignant tumour in humans. The tumour is
predominantly found in old age (7th-8th decades) and is
slightly more common in females than in males (female-male
ratio 1.5:1). The tumour is widely aggressive and rapidly
growing. The features at presentation are usually those of
extensive invasion of adjacent soft tissue, trachea and
oesophagus. These features include: dyspnoea, dysphagia
and hoarseness, in association with rapidly-growing tumour
in the neck. The tumour metastasises both to regional lymph
nodes and to distant organs such as the lungs.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
generally large and irregular, often invading the adjacent

bizarre and lobed nuclei and some assuming spindle
shapes.
The prognosis is poor: 5-year survival rate is less than
10% and median survival after the diagnosis is about
2 months.
PARATHYROID GLANDS
NORMAL STRUCTURE
ANATOMY. The parathyroid glands are usually 4 in
number: the superior pair derived from the 3rd branchial
pouch and inferior pair from the 4th branchial pouch of
primitive foregut. Both pairs are usually embedded in the
posterior aspect of the thyroid substance but separated from
it by a connective tissue capsule. In the adults, each gland is
an oval, yellowish-brown, flattened body, weighing 35-45
mg. There may, however, be variation in the number, location
and size of parathyroid glands.
HISTOLOGY AND FUNCTIONS. Microscopically,
parathyroid glands are composed of solid sheets and cords

strap muscles of the neck and other structures in the
vicinity of the thyroid. Cut surface of the tumour is white
and firm with areas of necrosis and haemorrhages.
Histologically, the tumour is too poorly-differentiated to
be placed in any other histologic type of thyroid cancer,
but usually shows a component of either papillary or
follicular carcinoma in better differentiated areas. The
tumour is generally composed of 3 types of cells occurring
in varying proportions: small cells, spindle cells and giant
cells. When one of these cell types is predominant, the
histologic variant of undifferentiated carcinoma is named
accordingly. Thus, there are 3 histologic variants:
1.
Small cell carcinoma: This type of tumour is
composed of closely packed small cells having hyper-
chromatic nuclei and numerous mitoses. This variant
closely resembles malignant lymphoma.
2.
Spindle cell carcinoma: These tumours are composed
of spindle cells resembling sarcoma. Some tumours may
contain obvious sarcomatous component such as areas of
osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma or rhabdomyosarcoma.
3.
Giant cell carcinoma: This type is composed of highly
anaplastic giant cells showing numerous atypical mitoses,

of parenchymal cells and variable amount of stromal fat. The
parenchymal cells are of 3 types: chief cells, oxyphil cells and
water-clear cells. The chief cells are most numerous and are
the major source of parathyroid hormone. The latter two
types of cells appear to be derived from the chief cells and
have sparse secretory granules but are potentially capable
of secreting parathyroid hormone.
The major function of the parathyroid hormone, in
conjunction with calcitonin and vitamin D, is to regulate
serum calcium levels and metabolism of bone. Parathyroid
hormone tends to elevate serum calcium level and reduce
serum phosphate level. Secretion of parathyroid hormone
takes place in response to serum levels of calcium by a
feedback mechanism—lowered serum calcium stimulates
secretion of parathyroid hormone, while elevated serum
calcium causes decreased secretion of the hormone. The role
of parathyroid hormone in regulating calcium metabolism
in the body is at the following 3 levels (Fig. 27.20):
1.
Parathyroid hormone stimulates osteoclastic activity and
results in resorption of bone and release of calcium. Calci-
tonin released by C-cells, on the other hand, opposes
parathyroid hormone by preventing resorption of bone and
lowering serum calcium level.
2.
Parathyroid hormone acts directly on renal tubular epithe-
lial cells and increases renal reabsorption of calcium and
inhibits reabsorption of phosphate; calcitonin enhances renal
excretion of phosphate.
3.
Parathyroid hormone increases renal production of the
most active metabolite of vitamin D, i.e. 1, 25-dihydrocholecalci-
ferol, which in turn increases calcium absorption from the
small intestine.
The major parathyroid disorders are its functional
disorders (hyper- and hypoparathyroidism) and neoplasms.
HYPERPARATHYROIDISM
Hyperfunction of the parathyroid glands occurs due to
excessive production of parathyroid hormone. It is classified
into 3 types—primary, secondary and tertiary.
Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs from oversecretion of
parathyroid hormone due to disease of the parathyroid
glands.
Secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by diseases in
other parts of the body.
Tertiary hyperparathyroidism develops from secondary
hyperplasia after removal of the cause of secondary
hyperplasia.
Primary Hyperparathyroidism
Primary hyperparathyroidism is not uncommon and occurs
more commonly with increasing age. It is especially likely
to occur in women near the time of menopause.
ETIOLOGY. Common causes of primary hyperpara-
thyroidism are as follows:
1.
Most commonly, parathyroid adenomas in approxi-
mately 80% cases.
2.
Carcinoma of the parathyroid glands in 2-3% patients.
3.
Primary hyperplasia in about 15% cases (usually chief
cell hyperplasia).
Also included above are the familial cases of multiple
endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes where parathyroid
adenoma or primary hyperplasia is one of the components.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The patients with primary hyper-
parathyroidism have the following characteristic biochemical
abnormalities:
1.
Elevated levels of parathyroid hormone
2.
Hypercalcaemia
3.
Hypophosphataemia
4.
Hypercalciuria
Clinical presentation of individuals with primary hyper-
parathyroidism may be in a variety of ways:
1.
Most commonly, nephrolithiasis and or/nephrocalcinosis
(page 690). These dysfunctions result from excessive
excretion of calcium in the urine due to hypercalcaemia
induced by increased parathyroid hormone level.
2.
Metastatic calcification, especially in the blood vessels,
kidneys, lungs, stomach, eyes and other tissues (page 53).
3.
Generalised osteitis fibrosa cystica due to osteoclastic
resorption of bone and its replacement by connective tissue
(page 835).
4.
Neuropsychiatric disturbances such as depression, anxiety,
psychosis and coma.
5.
Hypertension is found in about half the cases.
6.
Other changes such as pancreatitis, cholelithiasis and
peptic ulcers due to hypercalcaemia and high parathyroid
hormone level are less constant features.
Secondary Hyperparathyroidism
Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs due to increased
parathyroid hormone elaboration secondary to a disease
Figure 27.20
Role of parathormone in regulating calcium metabo-
lism in the body.

817
CHAPTER 27
The Endocrine System
elsewhere in the body. Hypocalcaemia stimulates compen-
satory hyperplasia of the parathyroid glands and causes
secondary hyperparathyroidism.
ETIOLOGY. Though any condition that causes hypo-
calcaemia stimulates excessive secretion of parathyroid
hormone, the important causes of secondary hyper-
parathyroidism are as under:
1.
Chronic renal insufficiency resulting in retention of
phosphate and impaired intestinal absorption of calcium.
2.
Vitamin D deficiency and consequent rickets and
osteomalacia may cause parathyroid hyperfunction.
3.
Intestinal malabsorption syndromes causing deficiency of
calcium and vitamin D.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The main biochemical abnormality
in secondary hyperparathyroidism is mild hypocalcaemia,
in striking contrast to hypercalcaemia in primary
hyperparathyroidism. The patients with secondary
hyperparathyroidism have signs and symptoms of the
disease which caused it. Usually, secondary hyperparathy-
roidism is a beneficial compensatory mechanism, but more
severe cases may be associated with renal osteodystrophy
(i.e. features of varying degree of osteitis fibrosa, osteo-
malacia, osteoporosis and osteosclerosis in cases of chronic
renal insufficiency) and soft tissue calcification (Fig. 27.21).
Tertiary Hyperparathyroidism
Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is a complication of secondary
hyperparathyroidism in which the hyperfunction persists in
spite of removal of the cause of secondary hyperplasia.
Possibly, a hyperplastic nodule in the parathyroid gland
develops which becomes partially autonomous and
continues to secrete large quantities of parathyroid hormone
without regard to the needs of the body.
HYPOPARATHYROIDISM
Deficiency or absence of parathyroid hormone secretion
causes hypoparathyroidism. Hypoparathyroidism is of 3
types—primary, pseudo- and pseudopseudo-hypoparathyroidism.
Primary Hypoparathyroidism
Primary hypoparathyroidism is caused by disease of the
parathyroid glands. Most common causes of primary
hypoparathyroidism are: surgical procedures involving
thyroid, parathyroid, or radical neck dissection for cancer.
Other causes are uncommon and include idiopathic
hypoparathyroidism of autoimmune origin in children and
may occur as sporadic or familial cases. These cases are
generally associated with other autoimmune diseases.
CLINICAL FEATURES. The main biochemical dysfunctions
in primary hypoparathyroidism are hypocalcaemia,
hyperphosphataemia and hypocalciuria. The clinical
manifestations of these abnormalities are as under:
1.
Increased neuromuscular irritability and tetany
2.
Calcification of the lens and cataract formation
3.
Abnormalities in cardiac conduction
4.
Disorders of the CNS due to intracranial calcification
5.
Abnormalities of the teeth.
Pseudo-hypoparathyroidism
In pseudo-hypoparathyroidism, the tissues fail to respond
to parathyroid hormone though parathyroid glands are
usually normal. It is a rare inherited condition with an
autosomal dominant character. The patients are generally
females and are characterised by signs and symptoms of
hypoparathyroidism and other clinical features like short
stature, short metacarpals and metatarsals, flat nose, round
face and multiple exostoses. Since renal tubules cannot
adequately respond to parathyroid hormone, there is hyper-
calciuria, hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia.
Pseudopseudo-hypoparathyroidism
Pseudopseudo-hypoparathyroidism is another rare familial
disorder in which all the clinical features of pseudo-
hypoparathyroidism are present except that these patients
have no hypocalcaemia or hyperphosphataemia and the
tissues respond normally to parathyroid hormone.
Pseudopseudo-hypoparathyroidism has been considered an
incomplete form of pseudo-hypoparathyroidism.
PARATHYROID TUMOURS
Parathyroid adenoma and carcinoma are the neoplasms
found in parathyroid glands, the former being much more
common than the latter.
Parathyroid Adenoma
The commonest tumour of the parathyroid glands is an
adenoma. It may occur at any age and in either sex but is
found more frequently in adult life. Most adenomas are first
brought to attention because of excessive secretion of
parathyroid hormone causing features of hyperparathy-
roidism as described above.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, a parathyroid
adenoma is small (less than 5 cm diameter) encapsulated,
yellowish-brown, ovoid nodule and weighing up to 5 gm
or more.
Figure 27.21
Major clinical manifestations of hyperparathyroidism.

818
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Microscopically, majority of adenomas are predominantly
composed of chief cells arranged in sheets or cords.
Oxyphil cells and water-clear cells may be found
intermingled in varying proportions. Usually, a rim of
normal parathyroid parenchyma and fat are present
external to the capsule which help to distinguish an
adenoma from diffuse hyperplasia.
Parathyroid Carcinoma
Carcinoma of the parathyroid is rare and produces manifes-
tations of hyperparathyroidism which is often more
pronounced. Carcinoma tends to be irregular in shape and
is adherent to the adjacent tissues. Most parathyroid
carcinomas are well-differentiated. It may be difficult to
distinguish carcinoma of parathyroid gland from an adenoma
but local invasion of adjacent tissues and distant metastases
are helpful criteria of malignancy in such cases.
ENDOCRINE PANCREAS
The human pancreas, though anatomically a single organ,
histologically and functionally, has 2 distinct parts—the
exocrine and endocrine. The exocrine part of the gland and
its disorders have already been discussed in Chapter 21.
The discussion here is focused on the endocrine pancreas
and its two main disorders: diabetes mellitus and islet cell
tumours.
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The endocrine pancreas consists of microscopic collections
of cells called islets of Langerhans found scattered within
the pancreatic lobules, as well as individual endocrine cells
found in duct epithelium and among the acini. The total
weight of endocrine pancreas in the adult, however, does
not exceed 1-1.5 gm (total weight of pancreas 60-100 gm).
The islet cell tissue is greatly concentrated in the tail than in
the head or body of the pancreas. Islets possess no ductal
system and they drain their secretory products directly into
the circulation. Ultrastructurally and immunohistochemi-
cally, 4 major and 2 minor types of islet cells are distinguished,
each type having its distinct secretory product and function.
These are as follows:
A. Major cell types:
1.
Beta (β) or B cells comprise about 70% of islet cells and
secrete insulin, the defective response or deficient synthesis
of which causes diabetes mellitus.
2.
Alpha (α) or A cells comprise 20% of islet cells and secrete
glucagon which induces hyperglycaemia.
3. Delta (δ) or D cells comprise 5-10% of islet cells and secrete
somatostatin which suppresses both insulin and glucagon
release.
4.
Pancreatic polypeptide (PP) cells or F cells comprise 1-2% of
islet cells and secrete pancreatic polypeptide having some
gastrointestinal effects.
B. Minor cell types:
1.
D1 cells elaborate vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)
which induces glycogenolysis and hyperglycaemia and
causes secretory diarrhoea by stimulation of gastrointestinal
fluid secretion.
2.
Enterochromaffin cells synthesise serotonin which in
pancreatic tumours may induce carcinoid syndrome.
DIABETES MELLITUS
Definition and Epidemiology
As per the WHO, diabetes mellitus (DM) is defined as a hetro-
geneous metabolic disorder characterised by common feature
of chronic hyperglycaemia with disturbance of carbohydrate,
fat and protein metabolism.
DM is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality world
over.  It is estimated that approximately 1% of population
suffers from DM. The incidence is rising in the developed
countries of the world at the rate of about 10% per year,
especially of type 2 DM, due to rising incidence of obesity
and reduced activity levels.  DM is expected to continue as a
major health problem owing to its serious complications,
especially end-stage renal disease, IHD, gangrene of the
lower extremities, and blindness in the adults. It is anticipated
that the number of diabetics will exceed 250 million by the
year 2010.
Classification and Etiology
The older classification systems dividing DM into primary
(idiopathic) and secondary types, juvenile-onset and maturity
onset types, and insulin-dependent (IDDM) and non-insulin
dependent (NIDDM) types, have become obsolete and
undergone major revision due to extensive understanding
of etiology and pathogenesis of DM in recent times.
As outlined in Table 27.4, current classification of DM
based on etiology divides it into two broad categories—type
TABLE 27.4: Etiologic Classification of Diabetes Mellitus

The Endocrine System
1 and type 2; besides there are a few uncommon specific
etiologic types, and gestational DM. American Diabetes
Association (2007) has identified risk factors for type 2 DM
listed in Table 27.5.
Brief comments on etiologic terminologies as contrasted
with former nomenclatures of DM are as under:
TYPE 1 DM. It constitutes about 10% cases of DM. It was
previously termed as juvenile-onset diabetes (JOD) due to
its occurrence in younger age, and was called insulin-
dependent DM (IDDM) because it was known that these
patients have absolute requirement for insulin replacement
as treatment. However, in the new classification, neither age
nor insulin-dependence are considered as absolute criteria.
Instead, based on underlying etiology, type 1 DM is further
divided into 2 subtypes:
Subtype 1A (immune-mediated) DM characterised by
autoimmune destruction of β-cells which usually leads to
insulin deficiency.
Subtype 1B (idiopathic) DM characterised by insulin
deficiency with tendency to develop ketosis but these patients
are negative for autoimmune markers.
Though type 1 DM occurs commonly in patients under
30 years of age, autoimmune destruction of β-cells can occur
at any age. In fact, 5-10% patients who develop DM above
30 years of age are of type 1A DM and hence the term JOD
has become obsolete.
TYPE 2 DM. This type comprises about 80% cases of DM. It
was previously called maturity-onset diabetes, or non-insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) of obese and non-
obese type.
Although type 2 DM predominantly affects older
individuals, it is now known that it also occurs in obese
adolescent children; hence the term MOD for it is
inappropriate. Moreover, many type 2 DM patients also
require insulin therapy to control hyperglycaemia or to
prevent ketosis and thus are not truly non-insulin dependent
contrary to its former nomenclature.
OTHER SPECIFIC ETIOLOGIC TYPES OF DM. Besides
the two main types, about 10% cases of DM have a known
specific etiologic defect listed in Table 27.4. One important
subtype in this group is maturity-onset diabetes of the young
(MODY) which has autosomal dominant inheritance, early
onset of hyperglycaemia and impaired insulin secretion.
GESTATIONAL DM. About 4% pregnant women develop
DM due to metabolic changes during pregnancy. Although
they revert back to normal glycaemia after delivery, these
women are prone to develop DM later in their life.
Pathogenesis
Depending upon etiology of DM, hyperglycaemia may result
from the following:
Reduced insulin secretion
Decreased glucose use by the body
Increased glucose production.
Pathogenesis of two main types of DM and its
complications is distinct. In order to understand it properly,
it is essential to first recall physiology of normal insulin
synthesis and secretion.
NORMAL INSULIN METABOLISM. The major stimulus for
both synthesis and release of insulin is glucose. The steps involved
in biosynthesis, release and actions of insulin are as follows
(Fig. 27.22):
Synthesis. Insulin is synthesised in the β-cells of pancreatic
islets of Langerhans:
i) It is initially formed as pre-proinsulin which is single-chain
86-amino acid precursor polypeptide.
ii) Subsequent proteolysis removes the amino terminal signal
peptide, forming proinsulin.
iii) Further cleavage of proinsulin gives rise to A (21 amino
acids) and B (30 amino acids) chains of insulin, linked together
by connecting segment called C-peptide, all of which are
stored in the secretory granules in the β-cells. As compared
to A and B chains of insulin, C-peptide is less susceptible to
degradation in the liver and is therefore used as a marker to
distinguish endogenously synthesised and exogenously
administered insulin.
For therapeutic purposes, human insulin is now produced
by recombinant DNA technology.
Release. Glucose is the key regulator of insulin secretion from
β-cells by a series of steps:
i) Hypoglycaemia (glucose level below 70 mg/dl or below
3.9 mmol/L) stimulates transport into β-cells of a glucose
transporter, GLUT2. Other stimuli influencing insulin release
include nutrients in the meal, ketones, amino acids etc.
ii) An islet transcription factor, glucokinase, causes glucose
phosphorylation, and thus acts as a step for controlled release
of glucose-regulated insulin secretion.
iii) Metabolism of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate by
glycolysis generates ATP.
iv) Generation of ATP alters the ion channel activity on the
membrane. It causes inhibition of ATP-sensitive K+ channel
on the cell membrane and opening up of calcium channel
with resultant influx of calcium, which stimulates insulin
release.
Action.  Half of insulin secreted from β-cells into portal vein
is degraded in the liver while the remaining half enters the
systemic circulation for action on the target cells:
i) Insulin from circulation binds to its receptor on the target
cells. Insulin receptor has intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity.
ii) This, in turn, activates post-receptor intracellular signalling
pathway molecules, insulin receptor substrates (IRS) 1 and 2

proteins, which initiate sequence of phosphorylation and
dephosphorylation reactions.
iii) These reactions on the target cells are responsible for the
main mitogenic and anabolic actions of insulin—glycogen
synthesis, glucose transport, protein synthesis, lipogenesis.
iv) Besides the role of glucose in maintaining equilibrium of
insulin release, low insulin level in the fasting state promotes
hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, reduced glucose
uptake by insulin-sensitive tissues and promotes
mobilisation of stored precursors, so as to prevent
hypoglycaemia.
PATHOGENESIS OF TYPE 1 DM. The basic phenomenon in
type 1 DM is destruction of β-cell mass, usually leading to absolute
insulin deficiency. While type 1B DM remains idiopathic,
pathogenesis of type 1A DM is immune-mediated and has
been extensively studied. Currently, pathogenesis of type 1A
DM is explained on the basis of 3 mutually-interlinked
mechanisms: genetic susceptibility, autoimmune factors, and
certain environmental factors (Fig. 27.23,A).
1. Genetic susceptibility. Type 1A DM involves inheritance
of multiple genes to confer susceptibility to the disorder:
i)
It has been observed in identical twins that if one twin has
type 1A DM, there is about 50% chance of the second twin
developing it, but not all. This means that some additional
modifying factors are involved in development of DM in
these cases.
ii) About half the cases with genetic predisposition to type
1A DM have the susceptibility gene located in the HLA region
of chromosome 6 (MHC class II region), particularly HLA
DR3, HLA DR4  and HLA DQ locus.
2. Autoimmune factors. Studies on humans and animal
models on type 1A DM have shown several immunologic
abnormalities:
i)Presence of islet cell antibodies against GAD (glutamic
acid decarboxylase), insulin etc, though their assay largely
remains a research tool due to tedious method.
ii) Occurrence of lymphocytic infiltrate in and around the
pancreatic islets termed insulitis. It chiefly consists of CD8+
T lymphocytes with variable number of CD4+ T lymphocytes
and macrophages.
iii) Selective destruction of β-cells while other islet cell types
(glucagon-producing alpha cells, somatostatin-producing
delta cells, or polypeptide-forming PP cells) remain
unaffected. This is mediated by T-cell mediated cytotoxicity
or by apoptosis.
iv) Role of T cell-mediated autoimmunity is further supported
by transfer of type 1A DM from diseased animal by infusing
T lymphocytes to a healthy animal.
v) Association of type 1A DM with other autoimmune diseases
in about 10-20% cases such as Graves’ disease, Addison’s
disease, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, pernicious anaemia.
vi) Remission of type 1A DM in response to immunosuppres-
sive therapy such as administration of cyclosporin A.
3.  Environmental factors. Epidemiologic studies in type 1A
DM suggest the involvement of certain environmental factors
in its pathogenesis, though role of none of them has been
conclusively proved. In fact, the trigger may precede the
occurrence of the disease by several years. It appears that
certain viral and dietary proteins share antigenic properties
with human cell surface proteins and trigger the immune
attack on β-cells by a process of molecular mimicry. These
factors include the following:
i)
Certain viral infections preceding the onset of disease e.g.
mumps, measles, coxsackie B virus, cytomegalovirus and
infectious mononucleosis.
ii) Experimental induction of type 1A DM with certain
chemicals has been possible e.g. alloxan, streptozotocin and
pentamidine.

iii) Geographic and seasonal variations in its incidence suggest
some common environmental factors.
iv) Possible relationship of early exposure to bovine milk
proteins and occurrence of autoimmune process in type 1A
DM is being studied.
KEY POINTS:  Pathogenesis of type 1A DM can be summed
up by interlinking the above three factors as under:
1. At birth, individuals with genetic susceptibility to this
disorder have normal β-cell mass.
2. β-cells act as autoantigens and activate CD4+ T lympho-
cytes, bringing about immune destruction of pancreatic
 β-cells by autoimmune phenomena and takes months to years.
Clinical features of diabetes manifest after more than 80% of
β-cell mass has been destroyed.
3. The trigger for autoimmune process appears to be some
infectious or environmental factor which specifically targets
β-cells.
PATHOGENESIS OF TYPE 2 DM.  The basic metabolic
defect in type 2 DM is either a delayed insulin secretion
relative to glucose load (impaired insulin secretion), or the
peripheral tissues are unable to respond to insulin (insulin
resistance).
Type 2 DM is a heterogeneous disorder with a more
complex etiology and is far more common than type 1, but
much less is known about its pathogenesis.  A number of
factors have been implicated though, but HLA association
and autoimmune phenomena are not implicated. These
factors are as under (Fig. 27.23,B):
1.
Genetic factors. Genetic component has a stronger basis
for type 2 DM than type 1A DM. Although no definite and
consistent genes have been identified, multifactorial
inheritance is the most important factor in development of
type 2 DM:
i)
There is approximately 80% chance of developing
diabetes in the other identical twin if one twin has the disease.
ii) A person with one parent having type 2 DM is at an
increased risk of getting diabetes, but if both parents have type
2 DM the risk in the offspring rises to 40%.
2.
Constitutional factors. Certain environmental factors
such as obesity, hypertension, and level of physical activity
play contributory role and modulate the phenotyping of the
disease.
3. Insulin resistance. One of the most prominent metabolic
features of type 2 DM is the lack of responsiveness of
peripheral tissues to insulin, especially of the skeletal muscle
and liver. Obesity, in particular, is strongly associated with
insulin resistance and hence type 2 DM. Mechanism of
hyperglycaemia in these cases is explained as under:
i)
Resistance to action of insulin impairs glucose utilisation
and hence hyperglycaemia.
ii) There is increased hepatic synthesis of glucose.
iii) Hyperglycaemia in obesity is related to high levels of free
fatty acids and cytokines (e.g. TNF-α and adiponectin) affect
peripheral tissue sensitivity to respond to insulin.
The precise underlying molecular defect responsible for
insulin resistance in type 2 DM has yet not been fully

822
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
identified. Currently, it is proposed that insulin resistance
may be possibly due to one of the following defects:
Polymorphism in various post-receptor intracellular signal
pathway molecules.
Elevated free fatty acids seen in obesity may contribute e.g.
by impaired glucose utilisation in the skeletal muscle, by
increased hepatic synthesis of glucose, and by impaired
β-cell function.
Insulin resistance syndrome is a complex of clinical features
occurring from insulin resistance and its resultant metabolic
derangements that includes hyperglycaemia and
compensatory hyperinsulinaemia. The clinical features are
in the form of accelerated cardiovascular disease and may
occur in both obese as well as non-obese type 2 DM patients.
The features include: mild hypertension (related to
endothelial dysfunction) and dyslipidaemia (characterised
by reduced HDL level, increased triglycerides and LDL level).
4. Impaired insulin secretion. In type 2 DM, insulin
resistance and insulin secretion are interlinked:
i)Early in the course of disease, in response to insulin
resistance there is compensatory increased secretion of
insulin (hyperinsulinaemia) in an attempt to maintain normal
blood glucose level.
ii)Eventually, however, there is failure of β-cell function to
secrete adequate insulin, although there is some secretion of
insulin i.e. cases of type 2 DM have mild to moderate
deficiency of insulin (which is much less severe than that in
type 1 DM) but not its total absence.
The exact genetic mechanism why there is a fall in insulin
secretion in these cases is unclear. However, following
possibilities are proposed:
Islet amyloid polypeptide (amylin) which forms fibrillar
protein deposits in pancreatic islets in longstanding cases of
type 2 DM may be responsible for impaired function of
β-cells of islet cells.
Metabolic environment of chronic hyperglycaemia
surrounding the islets (glucose toxicity) may paradoxically
impair islet cell function.
Elevated free fatty acid levels (lipotoxicity) in these cases
may worsen islet cell function.
5. Increased hepatic glucose synthesis. One of the normal
roles played by insulin is to promote hepatic storage of
glucose as glycogen and suppress gluconeogenesis. In type
2 DM, as a part of insulin resistance by peripheral tissues,
the liver also shows insulin resistance i.e. in spite of hyper-
insulinaemia in the early stage of disease, gluconeogenesis
in the liver is not suppressed. This results in increased hepatic
synthesis of glucose which contributes to hyperglycaemia
in these cases.
KEY POINTS:  In essence, hyperglycaemia in type 2 DM is
not due to destruction of β-cells but is instead a failure of β-
cells to meet the requirement of insulin in the body. Its
pathogenesis can be summed up by interlinking the above
factors as under:
1. Type 2 DM is a more complex multifactorial disease.
2. There is greater role of genetic defect and heredity.
3. Two main mechanisms for hyperglycaemia in type 2 DM—
insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion, are interlinked.
4.
While obesity plays a role in pathogenesis of insulin
resistance, impaired insulin secretion may be from many
constitutional factors.
5. Increased hepatic synthesis of glucose in initial period of
disease contributes to hyperglycaemia.
Morphologic Features in Pancreatic Islets
Morphologic changes in islets have been demonstrated
in both types of diabetes, though the changes are more
distinctive in type 1 DM:
1. Insulitis:
In type 1 DM, characteristically, in early stage there is
lymphocytic infiltrate, mainly by T cells, in the islets which
may be accompanied by a few macrophages and
polymorphs. Diabetic infants born to diabetic mothers,
however, have eosinophilic infiltrate in the islets.
In type 2 DM, there is no significant leucocytic infiltrate
in the islets but there is variable degree of fibrous tissue
in the islets.
2. Islet cell mass:
In type 1 DM, as the disease becomes chronic there is
progressive depletion of β−cell mass, eventually resulting
in total loss of pancreatic β−cells and its hyalinisation.
In type 2 DM,  β-cell mass is either normal or mildly
reduced. Infants of diabetic mothers, however, have
hyperplasia and hypertrophy of islets as a compensatory
response to maternal hyperglycaemia.
3. Amyloidosis:
In type 1 DM, deposits of amyloid around islets are
absent.
In type 2 DM, characteristically chronic long-standing
cases show deposition of  amyloid material, amylin,
around the capillaries of the islets causing compression
and atrophy of islet tissue (Fig. 27.24).

degranulation of remaining β-cells of islets.
In type 2 DM, no such change is observed.
Clinical Features
It can be appreciated that  hyperglycaemia in DM does not
cause a single disease but is associated with numerous
diseases and symptoms, especially due to complications.
Two main types of DM can be distinguished clinically to
the extent shown in Table 27.6. However, overlapping of
clinical features occurs as regards the age of onset, duration
of symptoms and family history. Pathophysiology in
evolution of clinical features is schematically shown in
Fig. 27.25.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Type 1 DM:
i)
Patients of type 1 DM usually manifest at early age,
generally below the age of 35.
ii) The onset of symptoms is often abrupt.
iii) At presentation, these patients have polyuria, polydipsia
and polyphagia.
iv) The patients are not obese but have generally progressive
loss of weight.
v) These patients are prone to develop metabolic
complications such as ketoacidosis and hypoglycaemic
episodes.
Type 2 DM:
i)
This form of diabetes generally manifests in middle life
or beyond, usually above the age of 40.
ii) The onset of symptoms in type 2 DM is slow and
insidious.
iii) Generally, the patient is asymptomatic when the
diagnosis is made on the basis of glucosuria or hyper-
glycaemia during physical examination, or may present with
polyuria and polydipsia.
iv) The patients are frequently obese and have unexplained
weakness and loss of weight.
v) Metabolic complications such as ketoacidosis are
infrequent.
Pathogenesis of Complications
It is now known that in both type 1 and 2 DM, severity and
chronicity of hyperglycaemia forms the main pathogenetic
mechanism for ‘microvascular complications’ (e.g.
retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy); therefore control of
blood glucose level constitutes the mainstay of treatment for
minimising development of these complications.
Longstanding cases of type 2 DM, however, in addition,
frequently develop ‘macrovascular complications’
(e.g. atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, peripheral
vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease) which are more
difficult to explain on the basis of hyperglycaemia alone.
The following  biochemical mechanisms have been
proposed to explain the development of  complications of
diabetes mellitus (Fig. 27.26, A):
1.
Non-enzymatic protein glycosylation: The free amino
group of various body proteins binds by non-enzymatic
mechanism to glucose; this process is called glycosylation and
is directly proportionate to the severity of hyperglycaemia.
Various body proteins undergoing chemical alterations in
this way include haemoglobin, lens crystalline protein, and
basement membrane of body cells. An example is the
measurement of a fraction of haemoglobin called
glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1C) as a test for monitoring
glycaemic control in a diabetic patient  during the preceding
Figure 27.26

825

The Endocrine System
>
90 to 120 days which is lifespan of red cells (page 288) .
Similarly, there is accumulation of labile and reversible glyco-
sylation products on collagen and other tissues of the blood
vessel wall which subsequently become stable and
irreversible by chemical changes and form advanced glyco-
sylation end-products (AGE). The AGEs bind to receptors
on different cells and produce a variety of biologic and
chemical changes e.g. thickening of vascular basement
membrane in diabetes.
2.
Polyol pathway mechanism. This mechanism is
responsible for producing lesions in the aorta, lens of the
eye, kidney and peripheral nerves. These tissues have an
enzyme, aldose reductase, that reacts with glucose to form
sorbitol and fructose in the cells of the hyperglycaemic patient
as under:
    
aldose reductase
Glucose + NADH + H+
 Sorbitol + NAD+
sorbitol
dehydrogenase
Sorbitol + NAD
 Fructose + NADH + H+
Intracellular accumulation of sorbitol and fructose so
produced results in entry of water inside the cell and
consequent cellular swelling and cell damage. Also, intra-
cellular accumulation of sorbitol causes intracellular
deficiency of myoinositol which promotes injury to Schwann
cells and retinal pericytes. These polyols result in disturbed
processing of normal intermediary metabolites leading to
complications of diabetes.
3.
Excessive oxygen free radicals. In hyperglycaemia, there
is increased production of reactive oxygen free radicals from
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation which may damage
various target cells in diabetes.
Complications of Diabetes
As a consequence of hyperglycaemia of diabetes, every tissue
and organ of the body undergoes biochemical and structural
alterations which account for the major complications in
diabetics which may be acute metabolic or chronic systemic.
Both types of diabetes mellitus may develop compli-
cations which are broadly divided into 2 major groups:
I.
Acute metabolic complications: These include diabetic
ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic coma, and
hypoglycaemia.
II. Late systemic complications: These are atherosclerosis,
diabetic microangiopathy, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic
neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy and infections.
I.
ACUTE METABOLIC COMPLICATIONS. Metabolic
complications develop acutely. While ketoacidosis and
hypoglycaemic episodes are primarily complications of type
1 DM, hyperosmolar nonketotic coma is chiefly a
complication of type 2 DM (also see Fig. 27.25).
1.
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Ketoacidosis is almost
exclusively a complication of type 1 DM. It can develop in
patients with severe insulin deficiency combined with
glucagon excess. Failure to take insulin and exposure to stress
are the usual precipitating causes. Severe lack of insulin
causes lipolysis in the adipose tissues, resulting in release of
free fatty acids into the plasma. These free fatty acids are
taken up by the liver where they are oxidised through acetyl
coenzyme-A to ketone bodies, principally acetoacetic acid
and β-hydroxybutyric acid. Such free fatty acid oxidation to
ketone bodies is accelerated in the presence of elevated level
of glucagon. Once the rate of ketogenesis exceeds the rate at
which the ketone bodies can be utilised by the muscles and
other tissues, ketonaemia and ketonuria occur. If urinary
excretion of ketone bodies is prevented due to dehydration,
systemic metabolic ketoacidosis occurs. Clinically, the
condition is characterised by anorexia, nausea, vomitings,
deep and fast breathing, mental confusion and coma. Most
patients of ketoacidosis recover.
2.
Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic nonketotic coma (HHS).
Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic nonketotic coma is usually a
complication of type 2 DM. It is caused by severe dehydration
resulting from sustained hyperglycaemic diuresis. The loss
of glucose in urine is so intense that the patient is unable to
drink sufficient water to maintain urinary fluid loss. The
usual clinical features of ketoacidosis are absent but
prominent central nervous signs are present. Blood sugar is
extremely high and plasma osmolality is high. Thrombotic
and bleeding complications are frequent due to high viscosity
of blood. The mortality rate in hyperosmolar nonketotic coma
is high.
The contrasting features of diabetic ketoacidosis and
hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma are summarised in
Table 27.7.
3.
Hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemic episode may develop
in patients of type 1 DM. It may result from excessive
administration of insulin, missing a meal, or due to stress.
Hypoglycaemic episodes are harmful as they produce
permanent brain damage, or may result in worsening of
diabetic control and rebound hyperglycaemia, so called
Somogyi’s effect.
II. LATE SYSTEMIC COMPLICATIONS. A number of
systemic complications may develop after a period of

Systemic Pathology
15-20 years in either type of diabetes. Late complications are
largely responsible for morbidity and premature mortality
in diabetes mellitus. These complications are briefly outlined
below as they are discussed in detail in relevant chapters
(Fig. 27.26,B).
1.
Atherosclerosis. Diabetes mellitus of both type 1 and
type 2 accelerates the development of atherosclerosis.
Consequently, atherosclerotic lesions appear earlier than in
the general population, are more extensive, and are more
often associated with complicated plaques such as ulceration,
calcification and thrombosis (page 398). The cause for this
accelerated atherosclerotic process is not known but possible
contributory factors are hyperlipidaemia, reduced HDL
levels, nonenzymatic glycosylation, increased platelet
adhesiveness, obesity and associated hypertension in
diabetes.
The possible ill-effects of accelerated atherosclerosis in
diabetes are early onset of coronary artery disease, silent
myocardial infarction, cerebral stroke and gangrene of the
toes and feet. Gangrene of the lower extremities is 100 times
more common in diabetics than in non-diabetics.
2.
Diabetic microangiopathy. Microangiopathy of diabetes
is characterised by basement membrane thickening of small
blood vessels and capillaries of different organs and tissues
such as the skin, skeletal muscle, eye and kidney. Similar
type of basement membrane-like material is also deposited
in nonvascular tissues such as peripheral nerves, renal
tubules and Bowman’s capsule. The pathogenesis of diabetic
microangiopathy as well as of peripheral neuropathy in dia-
betics is believed to be due to recurrent hyperglycaemia that
causes increased glycosylation of haemoglobin and other
proteins (e.g. collagen and basement membrane material)
resulting in thickening of basement membrane.
3.
Diabetic nephropathy. Renal involvement is a common
complication and a leading cause of death in diabetes. Four
types of lesions are described in diabetic nephropathy (page
677):
i)
Diabetic glomerulosclerosis which includes diffuse and
nodular lesions of glomerulosclerosis.
ii) Vascular lesions that include hyaline arteriolosclerosis of
afferent and efferent arterioles and atheromas of renal
arteries.
iii) Diabetic pyelonephritis and necrotising renal papillitis.
iv) Tubular lesions or Armanni-Ebstein lesion.
4.
Diabetic neuropathy. Diabetic neuropathy may affect all
parts of the nervous system but symmetric peripheral
neuropathy is most characteristic. The basic pathologic
changes are segmental demyelination, Schwann cell injury
and axonal damage (page 892). The pathogenesis of
neuropathy is not clear but it may be related to diffuse
microangiopathy as already explained, or may be due to
accumulation of sorbitol and fructose as a result of
hyperglycaemia, leading to deficiency of myoinositol.
5.
Diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is a leading
cause of blindness. There are 2 types of lesions involving
retinal vessels: background and proliferative (page 508). Besides
retinopathy, diabetes also predisposes the patients to early
development of cataract and glaucoma.
6.
Infections. Diabetics have enhanced susceptibility to
various infections such as tuberculosis, pneumonias,
pyelonephritis, otitis, carbuncles and diabetic ulcers. This
could be due to various factors such as impaired leucocyte
functions, reduced cellular immunity, poor blood supply due
to vascular involvement and hyperglycaemia per se.
Diagnosis of Diabetes
Hyperglycaemia remains the fundamental basis for the
diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. In symptomatic cases, the
diagnosis is not a problem and can be confirmed by finding
glucosuria and a random plasma glucose concentration
above 200 mg/dl.
The severity of clinical symptoms of polyuria and
polydipsia is directly related to the degree of hyperglycaemia.
In asymptomatic cases, when there is persistently elevated
fasting plasma glucose level, diagnosis again poses no
difficulty.
The problem arises in asymptomatic patients who have
normal fasting glucose level in the plasma but are suspected
to have diabetes on other grounds and are thus subjected to
oral glucose tolerance test (GTT). If abnormal GTT values
are found, these subjects are said to have ‘chemical diabetes’
(Fig. 27.27). The American Diabetes Association (2007) has
recommended definite diagnostic criteria for early diagnosis
of diabetes mellitus (Table 27.8).
The following investigations are helpful in establishing
the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus:
I.
URINE TESTING. Urine tests are cheap and convenient
but the diagnosis of diabetes cannot be based on urine testing
alone since there may be false-positives and false-negatives.
They can be used in population screening surveys. Urine is
tested for the presence of glucose and ketones.
1.
Glucosuria. Benedict’s qualitative test detects any reducing
substance in the urine and is not specific for glucose. More

CHAPTER 27
The Endocrine System
sensitive and glucose specific test is dipstick method based
on enzyme-coated paper strip which turns purple when
dipped in urine containing glucose.
The main disadvantage of relying on urinary glucose test
alone is the individual variation in renal threshold. Thus, a
diabetic patient may have a negative urinary glucose test
and a nondiabetic individual with low renal threshold may
have a positive urine test.
Besides diabetes mellitus, glucosuria may also occur in
certain other conditions such as: renal glycosuria, alimentary
(lag storage) glucosuria, many metabolic disorders,
starvation and intracranial lesions (e.g. cerebral tumour,
haemorrhage and head injury). However, two of these
conditions—renal glucosuria and alimentary glucosuria,
require further elaboration here.
Renal glucosuria (Fig. 27.27,B): After diabetes, the next
most common cause of glucosuria is the reduced renal
threshold for glucose. In such cases although the blood
glucose level is below 180 mg/dl (i.e. below normal renal
threshold for glucose) but glucose still appears regularly and
consistently in the urine due to lowered renal threshold.
Renal glucosuria is a benign condition unrelated to
diabetes and runs in families and may occur temporarily in
pregnancy without symptoms of diabetes.
Alimentary (lag storage) glucosuria (Fig. 27.27,C): A rapid
and transitory rise in blood glucose level above the normal
renal threshold may occur in some individuals after a meal.
During this period, glucosuria is present. This type of
response to meal is called ‘lag storage curve’ or more
appropriately ‘alimentary glucosuria’. A characteristic
feature is that unusually high blood glucose level returns to
normal 2 hours after meal.
2.
Ketonuria. Tests for ketone bodies in the urine are
required for assessing the severity of diabetes and not for
diagnosis of diabetes. However, if both glucosuria and
ketonuria are present, diagnosis of diabetes is almost certain.
Rothera’s test (nitroprusside reaction) and strip test are
conveniently performed for detection of ketonuria.
Besides uncontrolled diabetes, ketonuria may appear in
individuals with prolonged vomitings, fasting state or
exercising for long periods.
II. SINGLE BLOOD SUGAR ESTIMATION. For diag-
nosis of diabetes, blood sugar determinations are absolutely
necessary. Folin-Wu method of measurement of all reducing
substances in the blood including glucose is now obsolete.
Currently used are O-toluidine, Somogyi-Nelson and glucose
oxidase methods. Whole blood or plasma may be used but
whole blood values are 15% lower than plasma values.
A grossly elevated single determination of plasma
glucose may be sufficient to make the diagnosis of diabetes.
A fasting plasma glucose value above 126 mg/dl (>7 mmol/L) is
certainly indicative of diabetes. In other cases, oral GTT is
performed.
III. SCREENING BY FASTING GLUCOSE TEST. Fasting
plasma glucose determnitation is a screening test for DM
type 2. It is recommended that all individuals above 45 years
of age must undergo screening fasting glucose test every
3-years, and relatively earlier if the person is overweight or
at risk because of the following reasons:
i)
Many of the cases meeting the current criteria of DM are
asymptomatic and donot know that they have the disorder.
ii) Studies have shown that type 2 DM may be present for
about 10 years before symptomatic disease appears.
iii) About half the cases of type 2 DM have some diabetes-
related comlication at the time of diagnosis.
iv) The course of disease is favourably  altered with treat-
ment.
IV. ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST. Oral GTT is
performed principally for patients with borderline fasting
plasma glucose value (i.e. between 100-140 mg/dl). The
patient who is scheduled for oral GTT is instructed to eat a
high carbohydrate diet for at least 3 days prior to the test
and come after an overnight fast on the day of the test (for at
least 8 hours). A fasting blood sugar sample is first drawn.
Figure 27.27
The glucose tolerance test, showing blood glucose curves (venous blood glucose) and glucosuria after 75 gm of oral glucose.

828
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Then 75 gm of glucose dissolved in 300 ml of water is given.
Blood and urine specimen are collected at half-hourly
intervals for at least 2 hours. Blood or plasma glucose content
is measured and urine is tested for glucosuria to determine
the approximate renal threshold for glucose. Venous whole
blood concentrations are 15% lower than plasma glucose
values.
Currently accepted criteria for diagnosis of DM (as per
American Diabetes Association, 2007) are given in Table 27.8:
Normal cut off value for fasting blood glucose level is
considered as 100 mg/dl.
Cases with fasting blood glucose value in range of 100-
125 mg/dl are considered as impaired fasting glucose tolerance
(IGT); these cases are at increased risk of developing diabetes
later and therefore kept under observation for repeating the
test. During pregnancy, however, a case of IGT is treated as
a diabetic.
Individuals with fasting value of plasma glucose higher
than 126 mg/dl and 2-hour value after 75 gm oral glucose
higher than 200 mg/dl are labelled as diabetics (Fig. 27.27,D).
In symptomatic case, the random blood glucose value
above 200 mg/dl is diagnosed as diabetes mellitus.
V. OTHER TESTS. A few other tests are sometimes
performed in specific conditions in diabetics and for research
purposes:
1.
Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1C). Measurement of
blood glucose level in diabetics suffers from variation due
to dietary intake of the previous day. Long-term objective
assessment of degree of glycaemic control is better
monitored by measurement of glycosylated haemoglobin
(HbA1C), a minor haemoglobin component present in normal
persons. This is because the non-enzymatic glycosylation of
haemoglobin takes place over 90-120 days, lifespan of red
blood cells. HbA1C assay, therefore, gives an estimate of
diabetic control and compliance for the preceding 3-4
months. This assay has the advantage over traditional blood
glucose test that no dietary preparation or fasting is required.
Increased HbA1C  value almost certainly means DM but
normal value does not rule out IGT; thus the test is not used
for making the diagnosis of DM. Moreover, since HbA1C
assay has a direct relation between poor control and
development of complications, it is also a good measure of
prediction of microvascular complications. Care must be
taken in iterpretation of the HbA1C value because it varies
with the assay method used and is affected by presence of
haemoglobinopathies, anaemia, reticulocytosis, transfusions
and uraemia.
2.
Glycated albumin. This is used to monitor degree of
hyperglycaemia during previous 1-2 weeks when HbA1C can
not be used.
3.
Extended GTT. The oral GTT is extended to 3-4 hours for
appearance of symptoms of hyperglycaemia. It is a useful
test in cases of reactive hypoglycaemia of early diabetes.
4.
Intravenous GTT. This test is performed in persons who
have intestinal malabsorption or in postgastrectomy cases.
5.
Cortisone-primed GTT. This provocative test is a useful
investigative aid in cases of potential diabetics.
6.
Insulin assay. Plasma insulin can be measured by
radioimmunoasay and ELISA technique. Plasma insulin
deficiency is crucial for type 1 DM but is not essential for
making the diagnosis of DM.
7.
Proinsulin assay. Proinsulin is included in immunoassay
of insulin; normally it is <20% of total insulin.
8.
C-peptide assay. C-peptide is released in circulation
during conversion of proinsulin to insulin in equimolar
quantities to insulin; thus its levels correlate with insulin level
in blood except in islet cell tumours and in obesity. This test
is even more sensitive than insulin assay because its levels
are not affected by insulin therapy.
9.
Islet autoantibodies. Glutamic acid decarboxylase and
islet cell cytoplasmic antibodies may be used  as a marker for
type 1 DM.
10. Screening for diabetes-associated complications.
Besides making the diagnosis of DM based on the defined
criteria, screening tests are done for DM-associated
complications e.g. microalbuniuria, dyslipidaemia, thyroid
dysfunction etc.
ISLET CELL TUMOURS
Islet cell tumours are rare as compared with tumours of the
exocrine pancreas. Islet cell tumours are generally small and
may be hormonally inactive or may produce hyperfunction.
They may be benign or malignant, single or multiple. They
are named according to their histogenesis such as: β-cell
tumour (insulinoma), G-cell tumour (gastrinoma), A-cell
tumour (glucagonoma) D-cell tumour (somatostatinoma),
vipoma (diarrhoeagenic tumour from D1 cells which elaborate
VIP), pancreatic polypeptide (PP)-secreting tumour, and
carcinoid tumour. However, except insulinoma and
gastrinoma, all others are extremely rare and require no
further comments.
Insulinoma (βββββ-Cell Tumour)
Insulinomas or beta (β)-cell tumours are the most common
islet cell tumours. The neoplastic β-cells secrete insulin into
the blood stream which remains unaffected by normal
regulatory mechanisms. This results in characteristic attacks
of hypolgycaemia with blood glucose level falling to 50 mg/
dl or below, high plasma insulin level (hyperinsulinism) and
high insulin-glucose ratio. The central nervous mani-
festations are conspicuous which are promptly relieved by
intake of glucose. Besides insulinoma, however, there are
other causes of hypoglycaemia such as: in starvation, partial
gastrectomy, diffuse liver disease, hypopituitarism and
hypofunction of adrenal cortex.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, insulinoma is
usually solitary and well-encapsulated tumour which may
vary in size from 0.5 to 10 cm. Rarely, they are multiple.
Microscopically, the tumour is composed of cords and
sheets of well-differentiated β-cells which do not differ
from normal cells. Electron microscopy reveals typical
crystalline rectangular granules in the neoplastic cells. It
is extremely difficult to assess the degree of anaplasia to
distinguish benign from malignant β-cell tumour.

829
CHAPTER 27
The Endocrine System
Gastrinoma
(G-Cell Tumour, Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome)
Zollinger and Ellison described diagnostic triad consisting
of the following:
Fulminant peptic ulcer disease
Gastric acid hypersecretion
Presence of non-β pancreatic islet cell tumour.
Such non-β pancreatic islet cell tumour is the source of
gastrin, producing hypergastrinaemia and hence named
gastrinoma. Definite G cells similar to intestinal and gastric
G cells which are normally the source of gastrin in the body,
have not been identified in the normal human pancreas but
neoplastic cells of certain islet cell tumours have
ultrastructural similarities.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Majority of gastrinomas
occur in the wall of the duodenum. They may be benign
or malignant. Gastrinomas are associated with peptic
ulcers at usual sites such as the stomach, first and second
part of the duodenum, or sometimes at unusual sites such
as in the oesophagus and jejunum. About one-third of
patients have multiple endocrine neoplasia—multiple
adenomas of the islet cells, pituitary, adrenal and
parathyroid glands.
MISCELLANEOUS ENDOCRINE TUMOURS
MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA (MEN)
SYNDROMES
Multiple adenomas and hyperplasias of different endocrine
organs are a group of genetic diorders which produce
heterogeneous clinical features called multiple endocrine
neoplasia (MEN) syndromes. Presently, 4 distinct types of
MEN syndromes are distinguished. These are briefly outlined
below along with major disease associations:
1.
MEN type 1 syndrome (Wermer’s syndrome) includes
adenomas of the parathyroid glands, pancreatic islets and
pituitary. The syndrome is inherited as an autosomal
dominant trait. There is 50% chance of transmitting the
predisposing gene, MEN 1 (or menin) gene, to the child of an
affected person. MEN 1 is characterised by the following
features:
1. Parathyroid: Hyperplasia or adenoma; hyperparathy-
roidism is the most common (90%) clinical manifestation.
2. Pancreatic islet cells: Hyperplasia or adenoma seen in 80%
cases; frequently with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
3. Pituitary: Hyperplasia or adenoma in 65% cases; manifest
as acromegaly or hypopituitarism.
4. Adrenal cortex:  Uncommonly involved by adenoma or
pheochromocytoma.
5. Thyroid: Less commonly involved by adenoma or
hyperplasia.
2.
MEN type 2 syndrome (Sipple’s syndrome) is
characterised by medullary carcinoma thyroid and
pheochromocytoma. Genetic abnormality in these cases is
mutation in RET gene in almost all cases. MEN 2 has two
major syndromes:
MEN type 2A is the combination of medullary carcinoma
thyroid, pheochromocytoma and  hyperparathytroidism.
MEN type 2A has further three subvariants:
i)
MEN 2A with familial medullary carcinoma thyroid
ii) MEN 2A with cutaneous lichen amyloidosis
iii) MEN 2A with Hirschsprung’s disease.
MEN type 2B the combination of medullary carcinoma
thyroid, pheochromocytoma, mucosal neuromas, intestinal
ganglioneuromatosis, and marfanoid features.
3.
Mixed syndromes include a variety of endocrine
neoplastic combinations which are distinct from those in
MEN type 1 and type 2. A few examples are as under:
von Hippel-Lindau syndrome from mutation in VHL
gene is association of CNS tumours, renal cell carcinoma,
pheochromocytoma and islet cell tumours.
Type 1 neurofibromatosis from inactivation of neurofibro-
min protein and activation of RAS gene, is associated with
MEN type 1 or type 2 features.
POLYGLANDULAR AUTOIMMUNE (PGA) SYNDROMES
Immunologic syndromes affecting two or more endocrine
glands and some non-endocrine immune disturbances
produce syndromic presentation termed polyglandular
autoimmune (PGA) syndromes. PGA syndromes are of two
types:
PGA type I occurring in children is characterised by
mucocutaneous candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism, and
adrenal insufficiency.
PGA type II (Schmidt syndrome) presents in adults and
commonly comprises of adrenal insufficiency, autoimmune
thyroiditis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus.

SKELETAL SYSTEM
The skeleton consists of cartilage and bone. Cartilage has a
role in growth and repair of bone, and in the adults forms
the articular skeleton responsible for movement of joints.
Bone is a specialised form of connective tissue which
performs the function of providing mechanical support and
is also a mineral reservoir for calcium homeostasis. There
are 206 bones in the human body, and depending upon their
size and shape may be long, flat, tubular etc.
NORMAL STRUCTURE OF BONE
Bone is divided into 2 components (Fig. 28.1):
Cortical or compact bone comprises 80% of the skeleton
and is the dense outer shell responsible for structural rigidity.
It consists of haversian canals with blood vessels surrounded
by concentric layers of mineralised collagen forming osteons
which are joined together by cement lines.
Trabecular or cancellous bone composes 20% of the
skeleton and has trabeculae traversing the marrow space.
Its main role is in mineral homeostasis.
HISTOLOGY. Bone consists of large quantities of extra-
cellular matrix which is loaded with calcium hydroxyapatite
and relatively small number of bone cells which are of 3 main
types: osteoblasts, osteocytes and osteoclasts, besides the
ground substance, the osteoid matrix.
1.
Osteoblasts. Osteoblasts are uninucleate cells found
abundantly along the new bone-forming surfaces. They syn-
thesise bone matrix. The serum levels of bone-related alka-
line phosphatase (other being hepatic alkaline phosphatase) is
a marker for osteoblastic activity. Its levels are raised in
puberty during period of active bone growth and in
pathologic conditions associated with high osteoblastic
activity such as in fracture repair and Paget’s disease of the
bone.
2.
Osteocytes. Osteocytes are those osteoblasts which get
incorporated into the bone matrix during its synthesis. Osteo-
cytes are found within small spaces called lacunae lying in
the bone matrix. The distribution of the osteocytic lacunae is
a reliable parameter for distinguishing between woven and
lamellar bone.
Woven bone is immature and is rapidly deposited. It
contains large number of closely-packed osteocytes and
consists of irregular interlacing pattern of collagen fibre
bundles in bone matrix. Woven bone is seen in foetal life
and in children under 4 years of age.
Lamellar bone differs from woven bone in having smaller
and less numerous osteocytes and fine and parallel or
lamellar sheets of collagen fibres. Lamellar bone usually
replaces woven bone or pre-existing cartilage.
3.
Osteoclasts. Osteoclasts are large multinucleate cells of
mononuclear-macrophage origin and are responsible for
bone resorption. The osteoclastic activity is determined by
bone-related serum acid phosphatase levels (other being
prostatic acid phosphatase). Osteoclasts are found along the
endosteal surface of the cortical (compact) bone and the
trabeculae of trabecular (cancellous) bone.
4.
Osteoid matrix. The osteoid matrix of bone consists of
90-95% of collagen type I and comprises nearly half of total
Figure 28.1

CHAPTER 28
The Musculoskeletal System
body’s collagen. Virtually whole of body’s hydroxyproline
and hydroxylysine reside in the bone. The architecture of
bone collagen reflects the rate of its synthesis and may be
woven or lamellar, as described above.
BONE FORMATION AND RESORPTION. Bone is not a
static tissue but its formation and resorption are taking place
during period of growth as well as in adult life. Bone
deposition is the result of osteoblasts while bone resorption
is the function of osteoclasts. Bone formation may take place
directly from collagen called membranous ossification seen in
certain flat bones, or may occur through an intermediate stage
of cartilage termed endochondral ossification found in
metaphysis of long bones. In either case, firstly an uncalcified
osteoid matrix is formed by osteoblasts which is then
mineralised in 12-15 days. This delay in mineralisation results
in formation of about 15 μm thick osteoid seams at
calcification fronts (About > 1 μm of matrix osteoid is formed
daily). Uncalcified osteoid appears eosinophilic in H & E
stains and does not stain with von Kossa reaction, while
mineralised osteoid is basophilic in appearance and stains
black with von Kossa reaction (a stain for calcium). Areas of
active bone resorption have scalloped edges of bone surface
called Howship’s lacunae and contain multinucleated
osteoclasts. In this way, osteoblastic formation and
osteoclastic resorption continue to take place into adult life
in a balanced way termed bone modelling. The important role
of vitamin D1, parathyroid hormone and calcitonin in calcium
metabolism has already been discussed on page 248.
NORMAL STRUCTURE OF CARTILAGE
Unlike bone, the cartilage lacks blood vessels, lymphatics
and nerves. It may have focal areas of calcification. Carti-
lage consists of 2 components: cartilage matrix and
chondrocytes.
Cartilage matrix. Like bone, cartilage too consists of organic
and inorganic material. Inorganic material of cartilage is
calcium hydroxyapatite similar to that in bone matrix but
the organic material of the cartilage is distinct from the bone.
It consists of very high content of water (80%) and remaining
20% consists of type II collagen and proteoglycans. High
water content of cartilage matrix is responsible for function
of articular cartilage and lubrication. Proteoglycans are
macromolecules having proteins complexed with
polysaccharides termed glycosaminoglycans. Cartilage
glycosaminoglycans consist of chondroitin sulfate and
keratan sulfate, the former being most abundant comprising
55-90% of cartilage matrix varying on the age of the cartilage.
Chondrocytes. Primitive mesenchymal cells which form bone
cells form chondroblasts which give rise to chondrocytes.
However, calcified cartilage is removed by the osteoclasts.
Depending upon location and structural composition,
cartilage is of 3 types:
1.
Hyaline cartilage is the basic cartilaginous tissue
comprising articular cartilage of joints, cartilage in the growth
plates of developing bones, costochondral cartilage, cartilage
in the trachea, bronchi and larynx and the nasal cartilage.
Hyaline cartilage is the type found in most cartilage-forming
tumours and in the fracture callus.
2.
Fibrocartilage is a hyaline cartilage that contains more
abundant type II collagen fibres. It is found in annulus
fibrosus of intervertebral disc, menisci, insertions of joint
capsules, ligament and tendons. Fibrocartilage may also be
found in some cartilage-forming tumours and in the fracture
callus.
3.
Elastic cartilage is hyaline cartilage that contains abundant
elastin. Elastic cartilage is found in the pinna of ears,
epiglottis and arytenoid cartilage of the larynx.
Diseases of skeletal system include infection (osteo-
myelitis), disordered growth and development (skeletal dys-
plasias), metabolic and endocrine derangements, and
tumours and tumour-like conditions.
OSTEOMYELITIS
An infection of the bone is termed osteomyelitis (myelo =
marrow). A number of systemic infectious diseases may
spread to the bone such as enteric fever, actinomycosis,
mycetoma (madura foot), syphilis, tuberculosis and
brucellosis. However, two of the conditions which produce
significant pathologic lesions in the bone, namely pyogenic
osteomyelitis and tuberculous osteomyelitis, are described
below.
Pyogenic Osteomyelitis
Suppurative osteomyelitis is usually caused by bacterial
infection and rarely by fungi. Pyogenic osteomyelitis by
haematogenous route occurs most commonly in the long
bones of infants and young children (5-15 years of age),
particularly in the developing countries of the world. In the
developed world, however, where institution of antibiotics
is early and prompt, haematogenous spread of infection to
the bone is uncommon. In such cases, instead, direct
extension of infection from the adjacent area, frequently
involving the jaws and skull, is more common mode of
spread. Bacterial osteomyelitis may be a complication at all
ages in patients with compound fractures, surgical
procedures involving prosthesis or implants, gangrene of a
limb in diabetics, debilitation and immunosuppression.
Though any etiologic agent may cause osteomyelitis,
Staphylococcus aureus is implicated in a vast majority of cases.
Less frequently, other organisms such as streptococci,
Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella and anaerobes are
involved. Mixed infections are common in post-traumatic
cases of osteomyelitis. There may be transient bacteraemia
preceding the development of osteomyelitis so that blood
cultures may be positive.
Clinically, the child with acute haematogenous osteo-
myelitis has painful and tender limb. Fever, malaise and
leucocytosis generally accompany the bony lesion. Radio-
logic examination confirms the bony destruction.
Occasionally, osteomyelitis remains undiscovered until
it becomes chronic. Draining sinus tracts may form which
may occasionally be the site for development of squamous
carcinoma. Persistence, neglect and chronicity of osteo-

832
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
myelitis over a longer period of time may lead to develop-
ment of amyloidosis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Depending upon the
duration, osteomyelitis may be acute, subacute or chronic.
The basic pathologic changes in any stage of osteomyelitis
are: suppuration, ischaemic necrosis, healing by fibrosis
and bony repair. The sequence of pathologic changes is as
under (Fig. 28.2):
1.
The infection begins in the metaphyseal end of the
marrow cavity which is largely occupied by pus. At this
stage, microscopy reveals congestion, oedema and an
exudate of neutrophils.
2.
The tension in the marrow cavity is increased due to
pus and results in spread of infection along the marrow
cavity, into the endosteum, and into the haversian and
Volkmann’s canal, causing periosteitis.
3. The infection may reach the subperiosteal space
forming subperiosteal abscesses. It may penetrate through
the cortex creating draining skin sinus tracts (Fig. 28.3).
4. Combination of suppuration and impaired blood
supply to the cortical bone results in erosion, thin-
ning and infarction necrosis of the cortex called
sequestrum.
5.
With passage of time, there is formation of new bone
beneath the periosteum present over the infected bone.
This forms an encasing sheath around the necrosed bone
and is known as involucrum. Involucrum has irregular
surface and has perforations through which discharging
sinus tracts pass.
6.
Long continued neo-osteogenesis gives rise to dense
sclerotic pattern of osteomyelitis called chronic sclerosing
nonsuppurative osteomyelitis of Garré.
7.
Occasionally, acute osteomyelitis may be contained to
a localised area and walled off by fibrous tissue and
granulation tissue. This is termed Brodie’s abscess.
8.
In vertebral pyogenic osteomyelitis, infection begins from
the disc (discitis) and spreads to involve the vertebral
bodies (Fig. 28.4,A).
Figure 28.2
Pathogenesis of pyogenic osteomyelitis. A, The process begins as a focus of microabscess in a vascular loop in the marrow which
expands to stimulate resorption of adjacent bony trabeculae. Simultaneously, there is beginning of reactive woven bone formation by the periosteum.
B, The abscess expands further causing necrosis of the cortex called sequestrum. The formation of viable new reactive bone surrounding the
sequestrum is called involucrum. The extension of infection into the joint space, epiphysis and the skin produces a draining sinus.

833
CHAPTER 28
The Musculoskeletal System
COMPLICATIONS. Osteomyelitis may result in the
following complications:
1.
Septicaemia.
2.
Acute bacterial arthritis.
3.
Pathologic fractures.
4.
Development of squamous cell carcinoma in long-
standing cases.
5.
Secondary amyloidosis in long-standing cases.
6.
Vertebral osteomyelitis may cause vertebral collapse with
paravertebral abscess, epidural abscess, cord compression
and neurologic deficits.
Tuberculous Osteomyelitis
Tuberculous osteomyelitis, though rare in developed
countries, continues to be a common condition in under-
developed and developing countries of the world. The
tubercle bacilli, M. tuberculosis, reach the bone marrow and
synovium most commonly by haematogenous dissemination
from infection elsewhere, usually from the lungs, and
infrequently by direct extension from the pulmonary or
gastrointestinal tuberculosis (page 156). The disease affects
adolescents and young adults more often. Most frequently
involved are the spine and bones of extremities.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The bone lesions in tuber-
culosis have the same general histological appearance as
in tuberculosis elsewhere and consist of central caseation
necrosis surrounded by tuberculous granulation tissue
and fragments of necrotic bone (Fig. 28.5). The tuberculous
lesions appear as a focus of bone destruction and replace-
ment of the affected tissue by caseous material and
formation of multiple discharging sinuses through the soft
tissues and skin. Involvement of joint spaces and
intervertebral disc are frequent. Tuberculosis of the spine,
Pott’s disease, often commences in the vertebral body and
may be associated with compression fractures and
destruction of intervertebral discs, producing permanent
damage and paraplegia. Extension of caseous material
along with pus from the lumbar vertebrae to the sheaths
of psoas muscle produces psoas abscess or lumbar cold
abscess (Fig. 28.4,B). The cold abscess may burst through
the skin and form sinus. Long-standing cases may develop
systemic amyloidosis.
AVASCULAR NECROSIS (OSTEONECROSIS)
Avascular necrosis of the bones or osteonecrosis results from
ischaemia. It is a relatively common condition.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. It may occur from following
causes:
1.
Fracture or dislocation
2.
Sickle cell disease
3.
Corticosteroid administration
4.
Radiation therapy
5.
Chronic alcoholism
6.
Idiopathic
The pathogenetic mechanism of osteonecrosis in many
cases remains obscure, while in others it is by interruption
in the blood supply to the bones induced by direct trauma,
compression, or thromboembolic obstruction.
Figure 28.4
Osteomyelitis of the vertebral body.
Figure 28.5
Tuberculous osteomyelitis. There are epithelioid cell
granulomas with minute areas of caseation necrosis and surrounded by
Langhans’ giant cells. Pieces of necrotic bone are also seen.

834
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. There are pathological
fractures of the involved bone due to infarcts. Most
common sites are the ones where the disruption in blood
supply is at end-arterial circulation. The infarcts mainly
involve the medulla of the long bone in the diaphysis. This
is because the nutrient arteries supply blood to sinusoids
of the medulla and the inner cortex after penetrating the
cortex, while the cortex is relatively unaffected due to
collateral circulation.
Grossly, the lesional area shows a wedge-shaped area of
infarction in the subchondral bone under the convex
surface of the joint.
Microscopically, the infracted medulla shows saponified
marrow fat. The overlying cartilage and the cortex of the
long bones are relatively unaffected.
Longterm sequelae of osteonecrosis include occurrence
of malignant tumours in this location such as osteosarcoma,
malignant fibrous histiocytoma and fibrosarcoma etc.
FRACTURE HEALING
Fracture of the bone initiates a series of tissue changes which
eventually lead to restoration of normal structure and
function of the affected bone. Fracture of a bone is commonly
associated with injury to the soft tissues. The various types
of fractures and their mechanism of healing are discussed
along with healing of specialised tissues in Chapter 6
(page 171).
DISORDERS OF BONE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
(SKELETAL DYSPLASIAS)
A number of abnormalities of the skeleton are due to dis-
ordered bone growth and development and are collectively
termed skeletal dysplasias. These include both local and
systemic disorders.
Local defects involve a single bone or a group of bones
such as: absence or presence in diminished form, fused with
neighbouring bones (e.g. syndactyly), and formation of extra
bones (e.g. supernumerary ribs).
However, more importantly, skeletal dysplasias include
systemic disorders involving particular epiphyseal growth
plate. These include: achondroplasia (disorder of
chondroblasts), osteogenesis imperfecta (disorder of
osteoblasts), osteopetrosis (disorder of osteoclasts) and foetal
rickets (disorder of mineralisation). Though multiple
exostoses (osteochondromas) is a hereditary lesion, it is
described later along with solitary sporadic exostosis on page
843.
Achondroplasia
Achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant genetic abnor-
mality. There is selective interference with normal endo-
chondral ossification at the level of epiphyseal cartilaginous
growth plates of long bones. Thus, the long bones are
abnormally short but the skull grows normally leading to
relatively large skull. Achondroplasia is the commonest
cause of dwarfism.
Osteogenesis Imperfecta
Osteogenesis imperfecta is an autosomal dominant or reces-
sive disorder of synthesis of type I collagen that constitutes
90-95% of bone matrix. The disorder, thus, involves not only
the skeleton but other extra-skeletal tissues as well
containing type I collagen such as sclera, eyes, joints,
ligaments, teeth and skin. The skeletal manifestations of
osteogenesis imperfecta are due to defective osteoblasts
which normally synthesise type I collagen. This results in
thin or non-existent cortices and irregular trabeculae (too
little bone) so that the bones are very fragile and liable to
multiple fractures. The growth plate cartilage is, however,
normal. The condition may be evident at birth (osteogenesis
imperfecta congenita) when it is more severe, or may appear
during adolescence (osteogenesis imperfecta tarda) which
is a less incapacitating form. Extraskeletal lesions of osteo-
genesis imperfecta include blue and translucent sclerae,
hearing loss due to bony abnormalities of the middle and
inner ear, and imperfect teeth.
Osteopetrosis
Osteopetrosis, also called marble bone disease, is an autosomal
dominant or recessive disorder of increased skeletal mass or
osteosclerosis caused by a hereditary defect in osteoclast
function. The condition may appear in 2 forms: autosomal
recessive (malignant infantile form) and autosomal dominant
(benign adult form). Failure of normal osteoclast function of
bone resorption coupled with continued bone formation and
endochondral ossification results in net overgrowth of
calcified dense bone (too much bone) which occupies most of
the available marrow space. Despite increased density of the
bone, there is poor structural support so that the skeleton is
susceptible to fractures. Besides the skeletal abnormalities,
the infantile malignant form is characterised by effects of
marrow obliteration such as anaemia, neutropenia, thrombo-
cytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly with extramedullary
haematopoiesis, hydrocephalus and neurologic involvement
with consequent deafness, optic atrophy and blindness.
Metabolically, hypocalcaemia occurs due to defective
osteoclast function.
Histologically, the number of osteoclasts is increased
which have dysplastic, bizarre and irregular nuclei and
are dysfunctional.
METABOLIC AND ENDOCRINE BONE DISEASES
A large number of metabolic and endocrine disorders
produce generalised skeletal disorders. These include the
following:
1.
Osteoporosis—Resulting from quantitative reduction in
otherwise normal bone.
2.
Osteomalacia and rickets—Characterised by qualitative
abnormality in the form of impaired bone mineralisation due
to deficiency of vitamin D in adults and children respectively
(page 249).
3.
Scurvy—Caused by deficiency of vitamin C resulting in
subperiosteal haemorrhages (page 251).

Hyperparathyroidism—Leading to osteitis fibrosa
cystica (page 816).
5.
Pituitary dysfunctions—Hyperpituitarism causing
gigantism and acromegaly and hypopituitarism resulting in
dwarfism (page 793).
6.
Thyroid dysfunctions—Hyperthyroidism causing
osteoporosis and hypothyroidism leading to cretinism (page
802).
7.
Renal osteodystrophy—Occurring in chronic renal
failure and resulting in features of osteitis fibrosa cystica,
osteomalacia and areas of osteosclerosis.
8. Skeletal fluorosis—Occurring due to excess of sodium
fluoride content in the soil and water in an area.
Many of the conditions listed above have been discussed
in respective chapters already; others are considered below.
Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis or osteopenia is a common clinical syndrome
involving multiple bones in which there is quantitative
reduction of bone tissue mass but the bone tissue mass is
otherwise normal. This reduction in bone mass results in
fragile skeleton which is associated with increased risk of
fractures and consequent pain and deformity. The condition
is particularly common in elderly people and more frequent
in postmenopausal women. The condition may remain
asymptomatic or may cause only backache. However, more
extensive involvement is associated with fractures,
particularly of distal radius, femoral neck and vertebral
bodies. Osteoporosis may be difficult to distinguish radio-
logically from other osteopenias such as osteomalacia,
osteogenesis imperfecta, osteitis fibrosa of hyperpara-
thyroidism, renal osteodystrophy and multiple myeloma.
Radiologic evidence becomes apparent only after more than
30% of bone mass has been lost. Levels of serum calcium,
inorganic phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase are usually
within normal limits.
PATHOGENESIS. Osteoporosis is conventionally classified
into 2 major groups: primary and secondary.
Primary osteoporosis results primarily from osteopenia
without an underlying disease or medication. Primary
osteoporosis is further subdivided into 2 types: idiopathic type
found in the young and juveniles and is less frequent, and
involutional type seen in postmenopausal women and aging
individuals and is more common. The exact mechanism of
primary osteoporosis is not known but there is a suggestion
that it is the result of an excessive osteoclastic resorption and
slow bone formation. A number of risk factors have been
attributed to cause this imbalance between bone resorption
and bone formation. These include the following:
1.
Genetic factors—more marked in whites and Asians than
blacks.
2.
Sex—more frequent in females than in males.
3.
Reduced physical activity—as in old age.
4.
Deficiency of sex hormones—oestrogen deficiency in women
as in postmenopausal osteoporosis and androgen deficiency
in men.
5.
Combined deficiency of calcitonin and oestrogen.
6.
Hyperparathyroidism.
7.
Deficiency of vitamin D.
8.
Local factors—which may stimulate osteoclastic resorption
or slow osteoblastic bone formation.
Secondary osteoporosis is attributed to a number of
factors and conditions (e.g. immobilisation, chronic anaemia,
acromegaly, hepatic disease, hyperparathyroidism,
hypogonadism, thyrotoxicosis and starvation), or as an effect
of medication (e.g. hypercortisonism, administration of
anticonvulsant drugs and large dose of heparin).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Except disuse or immobi-
lisation osteoporosis which is localised to the affected limb,
other forms of osteoporosis have systemic skeletal
distribution. Most commonly encountered osteoporotic
fractures are: vertebral crush fracture, femoral neck
fracture and wrist fracture. There is enlargement of the
medullary cavity and thinning of the cortex.
Histologically, osteoporosis may be active or inactive
type.
Active osteoporosis is characterised by increased bone
resorption and formation i.e. accelerated turnover. There is
increase in the number of osteoclasts with increased
resorptive surface as well as increased quantity of osteoid
with increased osteoblastic surfaces. The width of osteoid
seams is normal.
Inactive osteoporosis has the features of minimal bone
formation and reduced resorptive activity i.e. reduced
turnover. Histological changes of inactive osteoporosis
include decreased number of osteoclasts with decreased
resorptive surfaces, and normal or reduced amount of
osteoid with decreased osteoblastic surface. The width of
osteoid seams is usually reduced or may be normal.
Osteitis Fibrosa Cystica
Hyperparathyroidism of primary or secondary type results
in oversecretion of parathyroid hormone which causes
increased osteoclastic resorption of the bone. General aspects
of hyperparathyroidism are discussed on page 816. Here,
skeletal manifestations of hyperparathyroidism are
considered. Severe and prolonged hyperparathyroidism
results in osteitis fibrosa cystica. The lesion is generally
induced as a manifestation of primary hyperparathyroidism,
and less frequently, as a result of secondary hyperpara-
thyroidism such as in chronic renal failure (renal
osteodystrophy).
The clinical manifestations of bone disease in hyper-
parathyroidism are its susceptibility to fracture, skeletal
deformities, joint pains and dysfunctions as a result of deran-
ged weight bearing. The bony changes may disappear after
cure of primary hyperparathyroidism such as removal of
functioning adenoma. The chief biochemical abnormality of
excessive parathyroid hormone is hypercalcaemia,
hypophosphataemia and hypercalciuria.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The bone lesions of
primary hyperparathyroidism affect the long bones more
severely and may range from minor degree of generalised

836
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
bone rarefaction to prominent areas of bone destruction
with cyst formation or brown tumours.
Grossly, there are focal areas of erosion of cortical bone
and loss of lamina dura at the roots of teeth.
Histologically, the following sequential changes appear
over a period of time:
Earliest change is demineralisation and increased bone
resorption beginning at the subperiosteal and endosteal
surface of the cortex and then spreading to the trabecular
bone.
There is replacement of bone and bone marrow by
fibrosis coupled with increased number of bizarre
osteoclasts at the surfaces of moth-eaten trabeculae and
cortex (osteitis fibrosa).
As a result of increased resorption, microfractures and
microhaemorrhages occur in the marrow cavity leading
to development of cysts (osteitis fibrosa cystica).
Haemosiderin-laden macrophages and multinucleate
giant cells appear at the areas of haemorrhages producing
an appearance termed as ‘brown tumour’ or ‘reparative giant
cell granuloma of hyperparathyroidism’ requiring
differentiation from giant cell tumour or osteoclastoma
(page 846). However, the so-called brown tumours, unlike
osteoclastoma, are not true tumours but instead regress
or disappear on surgical removal of hyperplastic or
adenomatous parathyroid tissue.
Renal Osteodystrophy (Metabolic Bone Disease)
Renal osteodystrophy is a loosely used term that encom-
passes a number of skeletal abnormalities appearing in cases
of chronic renal failure and in patients treated by dialysis for
several years (page 656). Renal osteodystrophy is more
common in children than in adults. Clinical symptoms of
bone disease in advanced renal failure appear in less than
10% of patients but radiologic and histologic changes are
observed in fairly large proportion of cases.
PATHOGENESIS. Renal osteodystrophy involves two
main events: hyperphosphataemia and hypocalcaemia which,
in turn, leads to parathormone elaboration and resultant
osteoclastic activity and major lesions of renal osteo-
dystrophy—osteomalacia (rickets in children), secondary
hyperparathyroidism, osteitis fibrosa cystica, osteosclerosis
and metastatic calcification.
The mechanisms underlying renal osteodystrophy are
schematically illustrated in Fig. 28.6 and briefly outlined
below:
1.
Hyperphosphataemia: In CRF, there is impaired renal
excretion of phosphate, causing phosphate retention and
hyperphosphataemia. Hyperphosphataemia, in turn, causes
hypocalcaemia which is responsible for secondary
hyperparathyroidism.
2.
Hypocalcaemia: Hypocalcaemia may also result from the
following:
Due to renal dysfunction, there is decreased conversion
of vitamin D metabolite 25(OH) cholecalciferol to its active
form 1,25 (OH)2 cholecalciferol.
Reduced intestinal absorption of calcium.
3.
Parathormone secretion: Hypocalcaemia stimulates
secretion of parathormone, eventually leading to secondary
hyperparathyroidism which, in turn, causes increased
osteoclastic activity.
4.
Metabolic acidosis: As a result of decreased renal
function, acidosis sets in which may cause osteoporosis and
bone decalcification.
5.
Calcium phosphorus product > 70: When the product of
biochemical value of calcium and phosphate is higher than
70, metastatic calcification may occur at extraosseous sites.
6.
Dialysis-related metabolic bone disease: Long-term dia-
lysis employing use of aluminium-containing dialysate is
currently considered to be a major cause of metabolic bone
lesions. Aluminium interferes with deposition of calcium

The Musculoskeletal System
hydroxyapatite in bone and results in osteomalacia,
secondary hyperparathyroidism and osteitis fibrosa cystica.
In addition, accumulation of β2-microglobulin amyloid in
such cases causes dialysis-related amyloidosis (page 86).
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The following skeletal
lesions can be identified in renal osteodystrophy:
1.
Mixed osteomalacia-osteitis fibrosa is the most common
manifestation of renal osteodystrophy resulting from
disordered vitamin D metabolism and secondary
hyperparathyroidism.
2.
Pure osteitis fibrosa results from metabolic compli-
cations of secondary hyperparathyroidism.
3.
Pure osteomalacia of renal osteodystrophy is attributed
to aluminium toxicity.
4.
Renal rickets resembling the changes seen in children
with nutritional rickets with widened osteoid seams may
occur (page 249).
5.
Osteosclerosis is characterised by enhanced bone
density in the upper and lower margins of vertebrae.
6.
Metastatic calcification is seen at extraosseous sites such
as in medium-sized blood vessels, periarticular tissues,
myocardium, eyes, lungs and gastric mucosa (page 53).
Skeletal Fluorosis
Fluorosis of bones occurs due to high sodium fluoride
content in soil and water consumed by people in some
geographic areas and is termed endemic fluorosis. Such
endemic regions exist in some tropical and subtropical
areas; in India it exists in parts of Punjab and Andhra
Pradesh. The condition affects farmers who consume
drinking water from wells. Non-endemic fluorosis results
from occupational exposure in manufacturing industries of
aluminium, magnesium, and superphosphate.
PATHOGENESIS. In fluorosis, fluoride replaces calcium as
the mineral in the bone and gets deposited without any
regulatory control. This results in heavily mineralised bones
which are thicker and denser but are otherwise weak and
deformed (just as in osteopetrosis). In addition, there are also
deposits of fluoride in soft tissues, particularly as nodules in
the interosseous membrane. The patient develops skeletal
deformities and mottling of teeth.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the long bones
and vertebrae develop nodular swellings which are
present both inside the bones and on the surface.
Microscopically, these nodules are composed of heavily
mineralised irregular osteoid admixed with fluoride which
requires confirmation chemically.
PAGET’S DISEASE OF BONE (OSTEITIS DEFORMANS)
Paget’s disease of bone* or osteitis deformans was first
described by Sir James Paget in 1877. Paget’s disease of bone
is an osteolytic and osteosclerotic bone disease of uncertain
etiology involving one (monostotic) or more bones
(polyostotic). The condition affects predominantly males over
the age of 50 years. Though the etiology remains obscure,
following factors have been implicated:
1. There has been some evidence that osteitis deformans is a
form of slow-virus infection by paramyxovirus (e.g. respiratory
syncytial virus, measles) in osteoclasts. However, the virus
has not been cultured from the osteoclasts of Paget’s disease.
2. Autosomal dominant inheritance and genetic susceptibility
have been proposed on the basis of observation of 7-10 fold
higher prevalence of disease in first-degree relatives. The
susceptibility gene located on chromosome 18q encodes for
a member of tumour necrosis factor called RANK (receptor
activator of nuclear factor: κB).
Clinically, the monostotic form of the disease may remain
asymptomatic and the lesion is discovered incidentally or
on radiologic examination. Polyostotic form, however, is more
widespread and may produce pain, fractures, skeletal
deformities, and occasionally, sarcomatous transformation.
Typically, there is marked elevation of serum alkaline
phosphatase and normal to high serum calcium level.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Monostotic Paget’s
disease involves most frequently: tibia, pelvis, femur, skull
and vertebra, while the order of involvement in polyostotic
Paget’s disease is: vertebrae, pelvis, femur, skull, sacrum
and tibia. Three sequential stages are identified in Paget’s
disease:
1.
Initial osteolytic stage: This stage is characterised by
areas of osteoclastic resorption produced by increased
number of large osteoclasts.
2.
Mixed osteolytic-osteoblastic stage: In this stage,
there is imbalance between osteoblastic laying down of
new bone and osteoclastic resorption so that
mineralisation of the newly-laid matrix lags behind,
resulting in development of characteristic mosaic pattern
or jigsaw puzzle appearance of osteoid seams or cement lines.
The narrow space between the trabeculae and cortex is
filled with collagen which gradually becomes less
vascular.
3.
Quiscent osteosclerotic stage: After many years,
excessive bone formation results so that the bone becomes
more compact and dense producing osteosclerosis.
However, newly-formed bone is poorly mineralised, soft
and susceptible to fractures. Radiologically, this stage
produces characteristic cotton-wool appearance of the
affected bone.
TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS OF BONE
In the context of bones, several non-neoplastic conditions
resemble true neoplasms and have to be distinguished from
them clinically, radiologically and morphologically.
Table 28.1 gives a list of such tumour-like lesions. A few
common conditions are described below.
Fibrous Dysplasia
Fibrous dysplasia is not an uncommon tumour-like lesion
of the bone. It is a benign condition, possibly of develop-
mental origin, characterised by the presence of localised area
*It is pertinent to recall here that James Paget described Paget’s disease
at three different anatomic sites which are not mutually interlinked in
any way: Paget’s disease of nipple (page 764), Paget’s disease of vulva
(page 722) and Paget’s disease of bone.

838
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
of replacement of bone by fibrous connective tissue with a
characteristic whorled pattern and containing trabeculae of
woven bone. Radiologically, the typical focus of fibrous
dysplasia has well-demarcated ground-glass appearance.
Three types of fibrous dysplasia are distinguished—
monostotic, polyostotic, and Albright syndrome. The
spectrum of phenotype of the disease is due to activating
mutation in GNAS1 gene, which encodes for α-subunits of
the stimulatory G-protein, GSα.
Monostotic fibrous dysplasia. Monostotic fibrous
dysplasia affects a solitary bone and is the most common
type, comprising about 70% of all cases. The condition affects
either sex and most patients are between 20 and 30 years of
age. The bones most often affected, in descending order of
frequency, are: ribs, craniofacial bones (especially maxilla),
femur, tibia and humerus. The condition generally remains
asymptomatic and is discovered incidentally, but
infrequently may produce tumour-like enlargement of the
affected bone.
Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. Polyostotic form of fibrous
dysplasia affecting several bones constitutes about 25% of
all cases. Both sexes are affected equally but the lesions
appear at a relatively earlier age than the monostotic form.
Most frequently affected bones are: craniofacial, ribs,
vertebrae and long bones of the limbs. Approximately a
quarter of cases with polyostotic form have more than half
of the skeleton involved by disease. The lesions may affect
one side of the body or may be distributed segmentally in a
limb. Spontaneous fractures and skeletal deformities occur
in childhood polyostotic form of the disease.
Albright syndrome. Also called McCune-Albright
syndrome, this is a form of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia
associated with endocrine dysfunctions and accounts for less
than 5% of all cases. Unlike monostotic and polyostotic
varieties, Albright syndrome is more common in females.
The syndrome is characterised by polyostotic bone lesions,
skin pigmentation (cafe-au-lait macular spots) and sexual
precocity, and infrequently other endocrinopathies.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. All forms of fibrous dys-
plasia have an identical pathologic appearance.
Grossly, the lesions appear as sharply-demarcated,
localised defects measuring 2-5 cm in diameter, present
within the cancellous bone, having thin and smooth
overlying cortex. The epiphyseal cartilages are generally
spared in the monostotic form but involved in the
polyostotic form of disease. Cut section of the lesion shows
replacement of normal cancellous bone of the marrow
cavity by gritty, grey-pink, rubbery soft tissue which may
have areas of haemorrhages, myxoid change and cyst
formation.
Histologically, the lesions of fibrous dysplasia have
characteristic benign-looking fibroblastic tissue arranged
in a loose, whorled pattern in which there are irregular
and curved trabeculae of woven (non-lamellar) bone in
the form fish-hook appearance or Chinese letter shapes.
Characteristically, there are no osteoblasts rimming then
trabeculae of the bone, suggesting a maturation defect in
the bone (Fig. 28.7). Rarely, malignant change may occur
in fibrous dysplasia, most often an osteogenic sarcoma.
Fibrous Cortical Defect (Metaphyseal
Fibrous Defect, Non-ossifying Fibroma)
Fibrous cortical defect or metaphyseal fibrous defect is a
rather common benign tumour-like lesion occurring in the
metaphyseal cortex of long bones in children. Most
commonly involved bones are upper or lower end of tibia or
lower end of femur. The lesion is generally solitary but rarely
there may be multiple and bilaterally symmetrical defects.
Radiologically, the lesion is eccentrically located in the
metaphysis and has a sharply-delimited border. The
pathogenesis of fibrous cortical defect is unknown. Possibly,
it arises as a result of some developmental defect at the
epiphyseal plate, or could be a tumour of histiocytic origin
because of close resemblance to fibrohistiocytic tumours
(page 864).
Clinically, fibrous cortical defect causes no symptoms and
is usually discovered accidentally when X-ray of the region
is done for some other reason.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the lesion is
generally small, less than 4 cm in diameter, granular and
brown. Larger lesion (5-10 cm) occurring usually in
response to trauma is referred to as non-ossifying fibroma.

839
CHAPTER 28
The Musculoskeletal System
Microscopically, fibrous cortical defect consists of cellular
masses of fibrous tissue showing storiform pattern. There
are numerous multinucleate osteoclast-like giant cells,
haemosiderin-laden macrophages and foamy cells; hence
the lesion is also termed histiocytic xanthogranuloma or
fibrous xanthoma of bone.
Solitary (Simple, Unicameral) Bone Cyst
Solitary, simple or unicameral bone cyst is a benign condition
occurring in children and adolescents, most frequently
located in the metaphyses at the upper end of humerus and
femur. The cyst expands the bone causing thinning of the
overlying cortex. Possibly, the lesion arises due to local
disorder of bone growth and development. Clinically, solitary
bone cyst may remain asymptomatic or may cause pain and
fracture.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, simple cyst of the
bone is generally unilocular with smooth inner surface.
The cavity is filled with clear fluid.
Histologically, the cyst wall consists of thin collagenous
tissue having scattered osteoclast giant cells and newly
formed reactive bony trabeculae. Fracture alters the
appearance and produces sanguineous fluid in the cavity,
and haemorrhages, haemosiderin deposits and
macrophages in the cyst wall.
Aneurysmal Bone Cyst
Aneurysmal bone cyst, true to its name, is an expanding
osteolytic lesion filled with blood (aneurysm = dilatation,
distension). The condition is seen more commonly in young
patients under 30 years of age. Most frequently involved
bones are shafts of metaphyses of long bones or the vertebral
column. The radiographic appearance shows characteristic
ballooned-out expansile lesion underneath the periosteum.
The pathogenesis is not clear but it has been suggested by
some authors that the condition probably arises from
persistent local alteration in haemodynamics. Clinically, the
aneurysmal bone cyst may enlarge over a period of years
and produce pain, tenderness and pathologic fracture.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the lesion
consists of a large haemorrhagic mass covered over by
thinned out reactive bone (Fig. 28.8).
Histologically, the cyst consists of blood-filled aneurys-
mal spaces of variable size, some of which are endo-
thelium-lined. The spaces are separated by connective
tissue septa containing osteoid tissue, numerous
osteoclast-like multinucleate giant cells and trabeculae of
bone (Fig. 28.9). The condition has to be distinguished
histologically from giant cell tumour or osteoclastoma
(page 846) and telangiectatic osteosarcoma (page 842).
BONE  TUMOURS
Bone tumours are comparatively infrequent but they are
clinically quite significant since some of them are highly
malignant. Bone tumours may be primary or metastatic. Since
histogenesis of some bone tumours is obscure, the WHO has
recommended a widely accepted classification of primary
bone tumours based on both histogenesis and histologic
criteria. Table 28.2 lists the various types of bone tumours
arising from different tissue components—osseous and non-
osseous, indigenous to the bone. However, in the discussion
below, only osseous bone tumours are considered, while non-
osseous bone tumours are described elsewhere in the book.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Figure 28.10
Anatomic locations of common primary bone tumours.
The anatomic origin of common primary bone tumours is
illustrated in Fig. 28.10.
It may be mentioned here that the diagnosis of any bone
lesion is established by a combination of clinical, radiological
and pathological examination, supplemented by biochemical
and haematological investigations wherever necessary. These
include: serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, alkaline
phosphatase and acid phosphatase. Specific investigations
like plasma and urinary proteins and the bone marrow
examination in case of myeloma, urinary catecholamines in
metastatic neuroblastoma and haematologic profile in
lymphoma and leukaemic involvement of the bone, are of
considerable help.
BONE-FORMING (OSTEOBLASTIC) TUMOURS
Bone-forming or osteoblastic group of bone tumours are
characterised by the common property of synthesis of osteoid
or bone, or both, directly by the tumour cells (osteogenesis).
Formation of reactive bone and endochondral ossification
should not be construed as osteogenesis. Benign bone-
forming tumours include: osteoma, osteoid osteoma and
osteoblastoma, while the malignant counterpart is osteo-
sarcoma (osteogenic sarcoma).
Osteoma
An osteoma is a rare benign, slow-growing lesion, regarded
by some as a hamartoma rather than a true neoplasm. Similar
lesions may occur following trauma, subperiosteal
haematoma or local inflammation. Osteoma is almost
exclusively restricted to flat bones of the skull and face. It
may grow into paranasal sinuses or protrude into the orbit.
An osteoma may form a component of Gardner’s syndrome
(page 585). Radiologic appearance is of a dense ivory-like
bony mass.
Microscopically, the lesion is composed of well-differen-
tiated mature lamellar bony trabeculae separated by
fibrovascular tissue.
Osteoid Osteoma and Osteoblastoma
Osteoid osteoma and osteoblastoma (or giant osteoid
osteoma) are closely related benign tumours occurring in
children and young adults. Osteoid osteoma is more common
than osteoblastoma. There are no clear-cut histologic criteria
to distinguish the two. The distinction between them is based
on clinical features, size and radiographic appearance.
Osteoid osteoma is small (usually less than 1 cm) and
painful tumour, located in the cortex of a long bone. The
tumour is clearly demarcated having surrounding zone of
reactive bone formation which radiographically appears as
Figure 28.9
Aneurysmal bone cyst. Histologic hallmark of lesion is presence of aneurysmal spaces filled with blood, partly lined by endothelium
and separated by connective tissue septa containing osteoclast-like giant cells along the wall of vascular spaces.

841
CHAPTER 28
The Musculoskeletal System
a small radiolucent central focus or nidus surrounded by
dense sclerotic bone.
Osteoblastoma, on the other hand, is larger in size
(usually more than 1 cm), painless, located in the medulla,
commonly in the vertebrae, ribs, ilium and long bones, and
there is absence of reactive bone formation.
Histologically, the distinction between osteoid osteoma
and osteoblastoma is not obvious. In either case, the lesion
consists of trabeculae of osteoid, rimmed by osteoblasts
and separated by highly vascularised connective tissue
stroma. Later, some of the trabeculae are mineralised and
calcified.
Osteosarcoma
Osteosarcoma or osteogenic sarcoma is the most common
primary malignant tumour of the bone. The tumour is
characterised by formation of osteoid or bone, or both, directly by
sarcoma cells. The tumour is thought to arise from primitive
osteoblast-forming mesenchyme. Depending upon their
locations within the bone, osteosarcomas are classified into
2 main categories: central (medullary) and surface ( parosteal
and perosteal).
CENTRAL (MEDULLARY) OSTEOSARCOMA
This is the more common and classic type and is generally
referred to as ‘osteosarcoma’ if not specified. The tumour
occurs in young patients between the age of 10 and 20 years.
Males are affected more frequently than females. The
tumour arises in the metaphysis of long bones. Most
common sites, in descending order of frequency, are: the
lower end of femur and upper end of tibia (i.e. around knee
joint about 60%); the upper end of humerus (10%); pelvis
and the upper end of femur (i.e. around hip joint about 15%);
and less often in jaw bones, vertebrae and skull. Rarely, an
osteosarcoma may occur in extraskeletal soft tissues.
Based upon the pathogenesis, osteosarcoma is divided
into 2 types: primary and secondary.
Primary osteosarcoma is more common and occurs in the
absence of any known underlying disease. Its etiology is
unknown but there is evidence linking this form of
osteosarcoma with genetic factors (e.g. hereditary mutation
of chromosome 13 in common with retinoblastoma locus),
period of active bone growth (occurrence of the tumour in
younger age), and with certain environmental influences
(e.g. radiation, oncogenic virus). Cases of hereditary retino-
blastoma have a very high prevalence risk of development
of osteosarcoma implicating RB gene in their pathogenesis.
About 20% sporadic osteosarcomas show mutation in p53
tumour suppressor gene; some have overexpression of
MDM2 gene and mutation in cyclin D1, p16  and CDK4.
Secondary osteosarcoma, on the other hand, develops
following pre-existing bone disease e.g. Paget’s disease of
bone, fibrous dysplasia, multiple osteochondromas, chronic
osteomyelitis, infarcts and fractures of bone. The tumour
has a more aggressive behaviour than the primary
osteosarcoma.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Medullary osteosarcoma is a highly malignant tumour.
The tumour arises centrally in the metaphysis, extends
longitudinally for variable distance into the medullary cavity,
expands laterally on either side breaking through the cortex
and lifting the periosteum. If the periosteum is breached, the
tumour grows relentlessly into the surrounding soft tissues.
The only tissue which is able to stop its spread, albeit
temporarily, is the cartilage of epiphyseal plate. The
radiographic appearance is quite distinctive: characteristic
‘sunburst pattern’ due to osteogenesis within the tumour and
presence of Codman’s triangle formed at the angle between
the elevated periosteum and underlying surface of the cortex.
Clinically, the usual osteosarcoma presents with pain,
tenderness and an obvious swelling of affected extremity.
Serum alkaline phosphatase level is generally raised but
calcium and phosphorus levels are normal. The tumour
metastasises rapidly and widely to distant sites by
haematogenous route and disseminates commonly to the
lungs, other bones, brain and various other sites.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour
appears as a grey-white, bulky mass at the metaphyseal
end of a long bone of the extremity. The articular end of
the bone is generally uninvolved in initial stage. Codman’s
triangle, though identified radiologically, may be obvious
on macroscopic examination (Fig. 28.11). Cut surface of
the tumour is grey-white with areas of haemorrhages and
necrotic bone. Tumours which form abundance of osteoid,
bone and cartilage may have hard, gritty and mucoid
areas.
Histologically, osteosarcoma shows considerable
variation in pattern from case-to-case and even within a
tumour from one area to the other. However, the following
two features characterise all classic forms of osteosarcomas
(Fig. 28.12):
1.
Sarcoma cells. The tumour cells of osteosarcomas are
undifferentiated mesenchymal stromal cells which show
marked pleomorphism and polymorphism i.e. variation
in size as well as shape. The tumour cells may have various
shapes such as spindled, round, oval and polygonal and
bizarre tumour giant cells. The tumour cells have variable
size and show hyperchromatism and atypical mitoses.
Histochemically, these tumour cells are positive for
alkaline phosphatase. Immunohistochemically, sarcoma
cells of osteosarcoma express vimentin, osteocalcin,
osteonectin and type I collagen.
2.
Osteogenesis. The anaplastic sarcoma cells form
osteoid matrix and bone directly; this is found interspersed
in the areas of tumour cells. In addition to osteoid and
bone, the tumour cells may produce cartilage, fibrous
tissue or myxoid tissue.
A few histologic variants of the usual osteosarcoma have
been described as under:
Telangiectatic osteosarcoma. The tumour in this variant
presents with pathological fractures. The tumour has large,
cavernous, dilated vascular channels. This variant has a more
aggrieve course.
Small cell osteosarcoma. This variant has small, uniform
tumour cells just like the tumour cells of Ewing’s sarcoma or
lymphoma but osteogensis by these tumour cells is the
distinguishing feature.
Fibrohistiocytic osteosarcoma. This variant resembles
malignant fibrous histiocytoma but having osteogenesis by
the tumour cells.
Figure 28.11
Osteosarcoma. The lower end of the femur shows a
bulky expanded tumour in the region of metaphysis sparing the epiphyseal
cartilage. Sectioned surface of the tumour shows lifting of the periosteum
by the tumour and eroded cortical bone. The tumour is grey-white with
areas of haemorrhage and necrosis.

843
CHAPTER 28
The Musculoskeletal System
Anaplastic osteosarcoma. In this variant, the tumour has so
marked anaplasia that it may resemble any other type of
pleomorphic sarcoma and is identified by the presence of
osteoid formed directly by the tumour cells.
Well-differentiated osteosarcoma. Although generally classic
form of osteosarcoma is a highly malignant tumour, rarely a
well-differentiated variant having minimal cytologic atypia
resembling parosteal osteosarcoma may be seen.
SURFACE OSTEOSARCOMA
About 5% of osteosarcomas occur on the surface of bone and
are slow-growing tumours compared to medullary
osteosarcomas. Surface osteosarcoma includes 2 variants:
parosteal and periosteal.
Parosteal or juxtacortical osteosarcoma is an uncommon
form of osteosarcoma having its origin from the metaphysis
on the external surface of the bone (parosteal or juxtacortical
means outer to cortex). The tumour should be distinguished
from the more common medullary osteosarcoma because of
its better prognosis and different presentation. The tumour
occurs in older age group, has no sex predilection and is slow
growing. Its common locations are metaphysis of long bones,
most frequently lower end of the femur and upper end of
the humerus. X-ray examination usually reveals a dense bony
mass attached to the outer cortex of the affected long bone.
Grossly, the tumour is lobulated and circumscribed,
calcified mass in the subperiosteal location.
Microscopically, the features which characterise the usual
osteosarcoma (sarcomatous stroma and production of
neoplastic osteoid and bone) are present, but the tumour
shows a high degree of structural differentiation, and there
are generally well-formed bony trabeculae. These features
account for distinctly better prognosis in these cases.
Periosteal osteosarcoma is a rare form of osteosarcoma that
arises between the cortex and the overlying periosteum. Its
common location is the diaphysis of the tibia or the femur.
Microscopically, periosteal osteosarcoma has cartilaginous
differentiation and higher degree of anaplasia than that
seen in parosteal osteosarcoma.
Table 28.3 sums up the contrasting features of central
(medullary) and surface (parosteal and periosteal)
osteosarcomas.
CARTILAGE-FORMING (CHONDROBLASTIC) TUMOURS
The tumours which are composed of frank cartilage or
derived from cartilage-forming cells are included in this
group. This group comprises benign lesions like osteocartila-
ginous exostoses (osteochondromas), enchondroma,
chondroblastoma and chondromyxoid fibroma, and a
malignant counterpart, chondrosarcoma.
Osteocartilaginous Exostoses (Osteochondromas)
Osteocartilaginous exostoses or osteochondromas are the
commonest of benign cartilage-forming lesions. Though
designated and discussed with neoplasms, exostosis or
osteochondroma is not a true tumour but is regarded as a
disorder of growth and development (page 834). It may occur
as a ‘solitary sporadic exostosis’ or there may be ‘multiple
hereditary exostoses’.
Exostoses arise from metaphyses of long bones as
exophytic lesions, most commonly lower femur and upper
tibia (i.e. around knee) and upper humerus but may also be
found in other bones such as the scapula or ilium. They are
discovered most commonly in late childhood or adolescence
and are more frequent in males. They may remain
asymptomatic and discovered as an incidental radiographic
finding or may produce obvious deformity. Both solitary and
multiple exostoses may undergo transformation into
chondrosarcoma but the risk is much greater with multiple
hereditary exostoses.

Osteosarcoma. Hallmarks of microscopic picture of the usual osteosarcoma are the sarcoma cells characterised by variation in
size and shape of tumour cells, bizarre mitosis and multinucleate tumour giant cells, and osteogenesis i.e. production of osteoid matrix and bone
directly by the tumour cells.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, osteochondro-
mas have a broad or narrow base (i.e. may be either sessile
or pedunculated) which is continuous with the cortical
bone. They protrude exophytically as mushroom-shaped,
cartilage-capped lesions enclosing well-formed cortical
bone and marrow (Fig. 28.13).
Microscopically, they are composed of outer cap
composed of mature cartilage resembling epiphyseal
cartilage and the inner mature lamellar bone and bone
marrow (Fig. 28.14).
Enchondroma
Enchondroma is the term used for the benign cartilage-
forming tumour that develops centrally within the interior
of the affected bone, while chondroma refers to the peripheral
development of lesion similar to osteochondromas.
Enchondromas may occur singly or they may be multiple,
forming a non-hereditary disorder called enchondromatosis or
Ollier’s disease. The coexistence of multiple enchondromas
with multiple soft tissue haemangiomas constitutes a familial
syndrome called Maffucci’s syndrome.
Most common locations for enchondromas are short
tubular bones of the hands and feet, and less commonly, they

The Musculoskeletal System
involve the ribs or the long bones. They may appear at any
age and in either sex. Enchondromas, like osteochondromas,
may remain asymptomatic or may cause pain and pathologic
fractures. X-ray reveals a radiolucent, lobulated tumour mass
with spotty calcification. Malignant transformation of solitary
enchondroma is rare but multiple enchondromas may
develop into chondrosarcoma.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the enchondroma
is lobulated, bluish-grey, translucent, cartilaginous mass
lying within the medullary cavity.
Histologically, the tumour has characteristic lobulated
appearance. The lobules are composed of normal adult
hyaline cartilage separated by vascularised fibrous stroma.
Foci of calcification may be evident within the tumour.
Enchondroma is distinguished from chondrosarcoma by
the absence of invasion into surrounding tissues and lack
of cytologic features of malignancy.
Chondroblastoma
Chondroblastoma is a relatively rare benign tumour arising
from the epiphysis of long bones adjacent to the epiphyseal
cartilage plate. Most commonly affected bones are upper tibia
and lower femur (i.e. about knee) and upper humerus. The
tumour usually occurs in patients under 20 years of age with
male preponderance (male-female ratio 2:1). The
radiographic appearance is of a sharply-circumscribed, lytic
lesion with multiple small foci of calcification. Chondro-
blastoma may be asymptomatic, or may produce local pain,
tenderness and discomfort. The behaviour of the tumour is
benign though it may recur locally after curettage.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, chondroblastoma
is a well-defined mass, up to 5 cm in diameter, lying in
the epiphysis. The tumour is surrounded by thin capsule
of dense sclerotic bone. Cut surface reveals a soft
chondroid tumour with foci of haemorrhages, necrosis and
calcification.
Histologically, the tumour is highly cellular and is
composed of small, round to polygonal mononuclear cells
resembling chondroblasts and has multinucleate
osteoclast-like giant cells. There are small areas of
cartilaginous intercellular matrix and focal calcification.
Chondromyxoid Fibroma
Chondromyxoid fibroma is an uncommon benign tumour
of cartilaginous origin arising in the metaphysis of long
bones. Most common locations are upper end of tibia and
lower end of femur i.e. around the knee joint. Majority of
tumours appear in 2nd to 3rd decades of life with male
preponderance. Radiologically, the tumour appears as a
sharply-outlined radiolucent area with foci of calcification
and expansion of affected end of the bone. The lesion may
be asymptomatic, or may cause pain, swelling and discomfort
in the affected joint. The lesions may recur after curettage.
Thus, there are many similarities with chondroblastoma.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, chondromyxoid
fibroma is sharply-demarcated, grey-white lobulated
mass, not exceeding 5 cm in diameter, lying in the
metaphysis. The tumour is often surrounded by a layer
of dense sclerotic bone. Cut surface of the tumour is soft
to firm and lobulated but calcification within the tumour
is not as common as with other cartilage-forming tumours.
Histologically, the tumour has essentially lobulated
pattern. The lobules are separated by fibrous tissue and
variable number of osteoclast-like giant cells. The lobules
themselves are composed of immature cartilage consisting
of spindle-shaped or stellate cells with abundant myxoid
or chondroid intercellular matrix.
In view of close histogenetic relationship between
chondromyxoid fibroma and chondroblastoma, occasional
tumours show a combination of histological features of both.
Chondrosarcoma
Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumour of chondroblasts.
In frequency, it is next in frequency to osteosarcoma but is
relatively slow-growing and thus has a much better
prognosis than that of osteosarcoma. Two types of
chondrosarcoma are distinguished: central and peripheral.
Central chondrosarcoma is more common and arises
within the medullary cavity of diaphysis or metaphysis. This
type of chondrosarcoma is generally primary i.e. occurs de
novo.
Peripheral chondrosarcoma arises in the cortex or peri-
osteum of metaphysis. It may be primary or secondary
occurring on a pre-existing benign cartilaginous tumour such
as osteocartilaginous exostoses (osteochondromas), multiple
enchondromatosis, and rarely, chondroblastoma.
Both forms of chondrosarcoma usually occur in patients
between 3rd and 6th decades of life with slight male
preponderance. In contrast to benign cartilaginous tumours,
majority of chondrosarcomas are found more often in the
central skeleton (i.e. in the pelvis, ribs and shoulders); other

cartilage cells covering the underlying mature lamellar bone containing
marrow spaces.

Systemic Pathology
site being around the knee joint. Radiologic appearance is of
hugely expansile and osteolytic growth with foci of
calcification. Clinically, the tumour is slow-growing and
comes to attention because of pain and gradual enlargement
over the years. Lower grades of the tumour recur following
surgical removal but higher grades cause metastatic
dissemination, commonly to the lungs, liver, kidney and
brain.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, chondrosarcoma
may vary in size from a few centimeters to extremely large
and lobulated masses of firm consistency. Cut section of
the tumour shows translucent, bluish-white, gelatinous
or myxoid appearance with foci of ossification (Fig. 28.15).
Histologically, the two hallmarks of chondrosarcoma are:
invasive character and formation of lobules of anaplastic
cartilage cells. These tumour cells show cytologic features
of malignancy such as hyperchromatism, pleomorphism,
two or more cells in the lacunae and tumour giant cells
(Fig. 28.16). However, sometimes distinction between a
well-differentiated chondrosarcoma and a benign
chondroma may be difficult and in such cases location,
clinical features and radiological appearance are often
helpful.
Rare variants of chondrosarcoma are mesenchymal
chondrosarcoma, dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma and clear
cell chondrosarcoma.
GIANT CELL TUMOUR (OSTEOCLASTOMA)
Giant cell tumour or osteoclastoma is a distinctive neoplasm
with uncertain histogenesis and hence classified separately.
The tumour arises in the epiphysis of long bones close to the
articular cartilage. Most common sites of involvement are
lower end of femur and upper end of tibia (i.e. about the
knee), lower end of radius and upper end of fibula. Giant
cell tumour occurs in patients between 20 and 40 years of
age with no sex predilection. Clinical features at presentation
include pain, especially on weight-bearing and movement,
noticeable swelling and pathological fracture. Radiologically,
giant cell tumour appears as a large, lobulated and osteolytic
lesion at the end of an expanded long bone with characteristic
‘soap bubble’ appearance.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, giant cell tumour
is eccentrically located in the epiphyseal end of a long bone
which is expanded. The tumour is well-circumscribed,
dark-tan and covered by a thin shell of subperiosteal bone.
Cut surface of the tumour is characteristically haemor-
rhagic, necrotic, and honey-combed due to focal areas of
cystic degeneration (Fig. 28.17).
Histologically, the hallmark features of giant cell tumour
are the presence of large number of multinucleate
osteoclast-like giant cells regularly scattered throughout
the stromal mononuclear cells (Fig. 28.18):
Giant cells often contain as many as 100 benign nuclei
and have many similarities to normal osteoclasts. These
cells have very high acid phosphatase activity.

847
CHAPTER 28
The Musculoskeletal System
Stromal cells are mononuclear cells and are the real
tumour cells and their histologic appearance determines
the biologic behaviour of the tumour. Typically, they are
uniform, plump, spindle-shaped or round to oval cells
with numerous mitotic figures.
Other features of the stroma include its scanty collagen
content, rich vascularity, areas of haemorrhages and
presence of macrophages.
Giant cell tumour of bone has certain peculiarities which
deserve further elaboration. These are: its cell of origin, its
differentiation from other giant cell lesions and its biologic
behaviour.
CELL OF ORIGIN. Though designated as giant cell tumour
or osteoclastoma, the true tumour cells are round to spindled
mononuclear cells and not osteoclast-like giant cells.
Histogenesis of tumour cells is uncertain but possibly they
are of mesenchymal origin. Available evidence suggests that
osteoclasts are derived from fusion of circulating monocytes,
the process being facilitated by transforming growth factor-
beta (TGF-β).
OTHER GIANT CELL LESIONS. This peculiar tumour with
above description is named ‘giant cell tumour’ but giant cells
are present in several other benign tumours and tumour-
like lesions from which the giant cell tumour is to be
distinguished. These benign giant cell lesions are:

Systemic Pathology
chondroblastoma, brown tumour of hyperparathyroidism,
reparative giant cell granuloma, aneurysmal bone cyst,
simple bone cyst and metaphyseal fibrous defect (non-
ossifying fibroma).
BIOLOGIC BEHAVIOUR. Giant cell tumours are best
described as aggressive lesions or low grade malignant
tumour. About 40 to 60% of them recur after curettage,
sometimes after a few decades of initial resection.
Approximately 4% cases result in distant metastases, mainly
to lungs. Metastases are histologically benign and there is
usually history of repeated curettages and recurrences. Thus
attempts at histologic grading of giant cell tumour do not
always yield satisfactory results. One of the factors
considered significant in malignant transformation of this
tumour is the role of radiotherapy resulting in development
of post-radiation bone sarcoma though primary (de novo)
malignant or dedifferentiated giant cell tumour may also
occur.
EWING’S SARCOMA AND PRIMITIVE
NEUROECTODERMAL TUMOUR (ES/PNET)
Ewing’s sarcoma (ES) is a highly malignant small round cell
tumour occurring in patients between the age of 5 and 20
years with predilection for occurrence in females. Since its
first description by James Ewing in 1921, histogenesis of this
tumour has been a debatable issue. At different times, the
possibilities suggested for the cell of origin have been
endothelial, pericytic, bone marrow, osteoblastic, and mesen-
chymal; currently it is settled for origin from primitive
neuroectodermal cells. Now, Ewing’s sarcoma includes 3
variants:
i)
classic (skeletal) Ewing’s sarcoma;
ii) soft tissue Ewing’s sarcoma; and
iii) primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET).
The three are linked together by a common neuroecto-
dermal origin and by a common cytogenetic translocation
abnormality t(11; 22) (q24; q12). This suggests a phenotypic
spectrum in these conditions varying from undifferentiated
Ewing’s sarcoma to PNET positive for rosettes and neural
markers (neuron-specific enolase, S-100). However, PNET
ultimately has a worse prognosis.
The skeletal Ewing’s sarcoma arises in the medullary
canal of diaphysis or metaphysis. The common sites are
shafts and metaphysis of long bones, particularly femur, tibia,
humerus and fibula, although some flat bones such as pelvis
and scapula may also be involved.
Clinical features include pain, tenderness and swelling
of the affected area accompanied by fever, leucocytosis and
elevated ESR. These signs and symptoms may lead to an
erroneous clinical diagnosis of osteomyelitis. However, X-
ray examination reveals a predominantly osteolytic lesion
with patchy subperiosteal reactive bone formation producing
characteristic ‘onion-skin’ radiographic appearance.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, Ewing’s sarcoma
is typically located in the medullary cavity and produces
expansion of the affected diaphysis (shaft) or metaphysis,
often extending into the adjacent soft tissues. The tumour
tissue is characteristically grey-white, soft and friable
(Fig. 28.19).
Histologically, Ewing’s tumour is a member of small round
cell tumours which includes other tumours such as: PNET,
neuroblastoma, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma,
lymphoma-leukaemias, and metastatic small cell
carcinoma. Ewing’s tumour shows the following
histologic characteristics (Fig. 28.20):
1.
Pattern. The tumour is divided by fibrous septa into
irregular lobules of closely-packed tumour cells. These

into soft tissues including the skeletal muscle. Cut surface of the tumour
is grey-white, cystic, soft and friable.

849
CHAPTER 28
The Musculoskeletal System
tumour cells are characteristically arranged around
capillaries forming pseudorosettes.
2. Tumour cells. The individual tumour cells comprising
the lobules are small and uniform resembling lymphocytes
and have ill-defined cytoplasmic outlines, scanty
cytoplasm and round nuclei having ‘salt and pepper’
chromatin and frequent mitoses. Based on these
cytological features the tumour is also called round cell
tumour or small blue cell tumour. The cytoplasm contains
glycogen that stains with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)
reaction. The consistently expressed cell surface marker
by tumour cells of ES/PNET group is CD99 which is a
product of MIC-2 gene located on X and Y chromosome.
3.
Other features. The tumour is richly vascularised and
lacks the intercellular network of reticulin fibres. There
may be areas of necrosis and acute inflammatory cell
infiltration. Focal areas of reactive bone formation may
be present.
Ewing’s sarcoma metastasises early by haematogenous
route to the lungs, liver, other bones and brain. Involvement
of other bones has prompted a suggestion of multicentric
origin of Ewing’s sarcoma. The prognosis of Ewing’s sarcoma
used to be dismal (5-year survival rate less than 10%). But
currently, use of combined regimen consisting of
radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy has improved the
outcome greatly (5-year survival rate 40-80%).
CHORDOMA
Chordoma is a slow-growing malignant tumour arising from
remnants of notochord. Notochord is the primitive axial
skeleton which subsequently develops into the spine.
Normally, remnants of notochord are represented by
notochordal or physaliphorous (physalis = bubble, phorous =
bearing) cells present in the nucleus pulposus and a few
clumps within the vertebral bodies. Chordomas thus occur
in the axial skeleton, particularly sacral and spheno-occipital
region, and infrequently in the vertebrae. Chordoma is
usually found in patients over the age of 40 years with no
sex predilection. Radiographically, the tumour usually
appears as an osteolytic lesion. Symptoms of spinal cord
compression may be present. The tumour grows slowly and
infiltrates adjacent structures but metastases develop rarely.
Recurrences after local excision are frequent and the tumour
almost invariably proves fatal.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
soft, lobulated, translucent and gelatinous with areas of
haemorrhages.
Microscopically, chordoma is composed of highly vacuo-
lated physaliphorous cells surrounded by a sea of
intercellular mucoid material (Fig. 28.21). Histologic
differentiation between chordoma and chondrosarcoma
or mucin-secreting carcinoma may sometimes be difficult.
Figure 28.20

outlines which are separated by fibrous tissue septa having rich vascularity. Areas of necrosis and inflammatory infiltrate are also included. Inbox in

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
METASTATIC BONE TUMOURS
Metastases to the skeleton are more frequent than the primary
bone tumours. Metastatic bone tumours are exceeded in
frequency by only 2 other organs—lungs and liver. Most
skeletal metastases are derived from haematogenous spread.
Bony metastases of carcinomas predominate over the
sarcomas. Some of the common carcinomas metastasising to
the bones are from: breast, prostate, lung, kidney, stomach,
thyroid, cervix, body of uterus, urinary bladder, testis,
melanoma and neuroblastoma of adrenal gland. Examples
of sarcomas which may metastasise to the bone are: embryonal
and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma and
osteosarcoma.
Skeletal metastases may be single or multiple. Most
commonly involved bones are: the spine, pelvis, femur, skull,
ribs and humerus. Usual radiographic appearance is of an
osteolytic lesion. Osteoblastic bone metastases occur in cancer
of the prostate, carcinoid tumour and small cell carcinoma
of lung.
Metastatic bone tumours generally reproduce the micros-
copic picture of primary tumour (Fig. 28.22). Many a times,
evidence of skeletal metastases is the first clinical manifes-
tation of an occult primary cancer in the body.
JOINTS
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The joints are of 2 types—diarthrodial or synovial joints with a
joint cavity, and synarthrodial or nonsynovial joints without a
joint cavity. Most of the diseases of joints affect diarthrodial
or synovial joints. In diarthrodial joints, the ends of two bones
are held together by joint capsule with ligaments and tendons
inserted at the outer surface of the capsule. The articular
surfaces of bones are covered by hyaline cartilage which is
thicker in weight-bearing areas than in nonweight-bearing
areas. The joint space is lined by synovial membrane or
synovium which forms synovial fluid that lubricates the joint
during movements. The synovium may be smooth or thrown
into numerous folds and villi. The synovial membrane is
composed of inner layer of 1-4 cell thick synoviocytes and
outer layer of loose vascular connective tissue. On electron
microscopy, two types of synoviocytes are distinguished:
type A and type B. Type A synoviocytes are more numerous
and are related to macrophages and produce degradative
enzymes, while type B synthesise hyaluronic acid.
Diseases of joints are numerous and joints are also invol-
ved in several systemic disorders. In the following discussion,
only those joint diseases which are morphologically
significant are described. Synovial tumours are discussed in
the next chapter together with other soft tissue tumours.
OSTEOARTHRITIS
Osteoarthritis (OA), also called osteoarthrosis or degenerative
joint disease (DJD), is the most common form of chronic
disorder of synovial joints. It is characterised by progressive
degenerative changes in the articular cartilages over the
years, particularly in weight-bearing joints.
TYPES AND PATHOGENESIS. OA occurs in 2 clinical
forms—primary and secondary.
Primary OA occurs in the elderly, more commonly in
women than in men. The process begins by the end of 4th
decade and then progressively and steadily increases
producing clinical symptoms. Little is known about the
etiology and pathogenesis of primary OA. The condition may
be regarded as a reward of longevity. Probably, wear and
tear with repeated minor trauma, heredity, obesity, aging
per se, all contribute to focal degenerative changes in the
articular cartilage of the joints. Genetic factors favouring
susceptibility to develop OA have been observed; genetic
mutations in proteins which regulate the cartilage growth
have been identified e.g. FRZB gene.
Secondary OA may appear at any age and is the result
of any previous wear and tear phenomena involving the joint
such as previous injury, fracture, inflammation, loose bodies
and congenital dislocation of the hip.
The molecular mechanism of damage to cartilage in OA
appears to be the breakdown of collagen type II, probably
by IL-1, TNF and nitric oxide.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. As mentioned above, the
weight-bearing joints such as hips, knee and vertebrae are
most commonly involved but interphalangeal joints of
fingers may also be affected. The pathologic changes occur
in the articular cartilages, adjacent bones and synovium
(Fig. 28.23):
1.
Articular cartilages. The regressive changes are most
marked in the weight-bearing regions of articular
cartilages. Initially, there is loss of cartilaginous matrix
(proteoglycans) resulting in progressive loss of normal
metachromasia. This is followed by focal loss of
chondrocytes, and at other places, proliferation of
chondrocytes forming clusters. Further progression of the
process causes loosening, flaking and fissuring of the
articular cartilage resulting in breaking off of pieces of
cartilage exposing subchondral bone. Radiologically, this
progressive loss of cartilage is apparent as narrowed joint
space.
Figure 28.22
Osseous deposits from carcinoma breast.

851
CHAPTER 28
The Musculoskeletal System
2.
Bone. The denuded subchondral bone appears like
polished ivory. There is death of superficial osteocytes and
increased osteoclastic activity causing rarefaction,
microcyst formation and occasionally microfractures of
the subjacent bone. These changes result in remodelling
of bone and changes in the shape of joint surface leading
to flattening and mushroom-like appearance of the
articular end of the bone. The margins of the joints respond
to cartilage damage by osteophyte or spur formation. These
are cartilaginous outgrowths at the joint margins which
later get ossified. Osteophytes give the appearance of
lipping of the affected joint. Loosened and fragmented
osteophytes may form free ‘joint mice’ or loose bodies.
3.
Synovium. Initially, there are no pathologic changes
in the synovium but in advanced cases there is low-grade
chronic synovitis and villous hypertrophy. There may be
some amount of synovial effusion associated with chronic
synovitis.
The manifestations of OA are most conspicuous in large
joints such as hips, knee and back. However, the pattern of
joint involvement may be related to the type of physical
activity such as ballet-dancers’ toes, karate fingers etc. Minor
degree of OA may remain asymptomatic. In symptomatic
cases, clinical manifestations are joint stiffness, diminished
mobility, discomfort and pain. The symptoms are more
prominent on waking up from bed in the morning.
Degenerative changes in the interphalangeal joints lead to
hard bony and painless enlargements in the form of nodules
at the base of terminal phalanx called Heberden’s nodes. These
nodes are more common in females and heredity seems to
play a role. In the spine, osteophytes of OA may cause com-
pression of cervical and lumbar nerve root with pain, muscle
spasms and neurologic abnormalities.
RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic multisystem disease
of unknown cause. Though the most prominent mani-
festation of RA is inflammatory arthritis of the peripheral
joints, usually with a symmetrical distribution, its systemic
manifestations include haematologic, pulmonary,
neurological and cardiovascular abnormalities.
RA is a common disease having peak incidence in 3rd to
4th decades of life, with 3-5 times higher preponderance in
females. The condition has high association with HLA-DR4
and HLA-DR1 and familial aggregation. The onset of disease
is insidious, beginning with prodrome of fatigue, weakness,
joint stiffness, vague arthralgias and myalgias. This is
followed by pain and swelling of joints usually in
symmetrical fashion, especially involving joints of hands,
wrists and feet. Unlike migratory polyarthritis of rheumatic
fever, RA usually persists in the involved joint.
Approximately 20% of patients develop rheumatoid nodules
located over the extensor surfaces of the elbows and fingers.
About 80% of cases are seropositive for rheumatoid factor
(RF). However, RF titres are elevated in certain unrelated
diseases too such as in: viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, sarcoidosis
and leprosy. Advanced cases show characteristic radiologic
abnormalities such as narrowing of joint space and ulnar
deviation of the fingers and radial deviation of the wrist.
Other laboratory findings include mild normocytic and
normochromic anaemia, elevated ESR, mild leucocytosis and
hypergammaglobulinaemia. Extra-articular manifestations
infrequently produce symptoms, but when present
complicate the diagnosis.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Present concept on etiology and
pathogenesis proposes that RA occurs in an immunogenetically
predisposed individual to the effect of microbial agents acting as
trigger antigen. The role of superantigens which are produced
by several microorganisms with capacity to bind to HLA-
DR molecules (MHC-II region) has also emerged.
I.
Immunologic derangements. A number of observations
in patients and experimental animals indicate the role of
immune processes, particularly autoimmune phenomenon,
in the development of RA. These include the following:
1.
Detection of circulating autoantibody called rheumatoid
factor (RF) against Fc portion of autologous IgG in about 80%
cases of RA. RF antibodies are heterogeneous and consist of
IgM and IgG class.
2.
The presence of antigen-antibody complexes (IgG-RF
complexes) in the circulation as well as in the synovial fluid.
3.
The presence of other autoantibodies such as antinuclear
factor (ANF), antibodies to collagen type II, and antibodies
to cytoskeleton.
4.
Antigenicity of proteoglycans of human articular
cartilage.
5.
The presence of γ-globulin, particularly IgG and IgM, in
the synovial fluid.
6.
Association of RA with amyloidosis.
7.
Activation of cell-mediated immunity as observed by
presence of numerous inflammatory cells in the synovium,
chiefly CD4+ T lymphocytes and some macrophages.
II. Trigger events. Though the above hypothesis of a
possible role of autoimmunity in the etiology and patho-
genesis of RA is generally widely accepted, controversy
continues as regards the trigger events which initiate the
destruction of articular cartilage. Various possibilities which
have been suggested are as follows:

virus, either locally in the synovial fluid or systemic infection
some time prior to the attack of RA.
2.
The possible role of HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR1 in initia-
tion of immunologic damage.
The proposed events in immunopathogenesis of RA are
as under (Fig. 28.24):
In response to antigenic exposure (e.g. infectious agent)
in a genetically predisposed individual (HLA-DR), CD4+ T-
cells are activated.
These cells elaborate cytokines, the important ones being
tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IF)-γ ,  interleukin
(IL)-1 and IL-6.
These cytokines activate endothelial cells, B lymphocytes
and macrophages.
Activation of B-cells releases IgM antibody against  IgG
(i.e. anti-IgG); this molecule is termed rheumatoid factor (RF).
IgG and IgM immune complexes trigger inflammatory
damage to the synovium, small blood vessels and collagen.
Activated endothelial cells express adhesion molecules
which stimulate collection of inflammatory  cells.
Activation of macrophages releases more cytokines which
cause damage to joint tissues and vascularisation of cartilage
termed pannus formation.
Eventually damage and destruction of bone and cartilage
are followed by fibrosis and ankylosis producing joint
deformities.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The predominant patho-
logic lesions are found in the joints and tendons, and less
often, extra-articular lesions are encountered.
ARTICULAR LESIONS. RA involves first the small joints
of hands and feet and then symmetrically affects the joints
of wrists, elbows, ankles and knees. The proximal
interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints are
affected most severely. Frequently cervical spine is
involved but lumbar spine is spared.
Histologically, the characteristic feature is diffuse
proliferative synovitis with formation of pannus. The
microscopic changes are as under (Fig. 28.25):
1.
Numerous folds of large villi of synovium.
2.
Marked thickening of the synovial membrane due to
oedema, congestion and multilayering of synoviocytes.
3.
Intense inflammatory cell infiltrate in the synovial
membrane with predominence of lymphocytes, plasma
cells and some macrophages, at places forming lymphoid
follicles.
4.
Foci of fibrinoid necrosis and fibrin deposition.
The pannus progressively destroys the underlying
cartilage and subchondral bone. This invasion of pannus
results in demineralisation and cystic resorption of under-
lying bone. Later, fibrous adhesions or even bony
ankylosis may unite the two opposing joint surfaces. In
addition, persistent inflammation causes weakening and
even rupture of the tendons.
EXTRA-ARTICULAR LESIONS. Nonspecific inflam-
matory changes are seen in the blood vessels (acute
vasculitis), lungs, pleura, pericardium, myocardium,
lymph nodes, peripheral nerves and eyes. But one of the
characteristic extra-articular manifestation of RA is
occurrence of rheumatoid nodules in the skin. Rheumatoid
nodules are particularly found in the subcutaneous tissue
over pressure points such as the elbows, occiput and
sacrum. The centre of these nodules consists of an area of
fibrinoid necrosis and cellular debris, surrounded by
several layers of palisading large epithelioid cells, and
peripherally there are numerous lymphocytes, plasma
cells and macrophages. Similar nodules may be found in
the lung parenchyma, pleura, heart valves, myocardium
and other internal organs.
There are a few variant forms of RA:
1.
Juvenile RA found in adolescent patients under 16 years
of age is characterised by acute onset of fever and
predominant involvement of knees and ankles. Pathologic
changes are similar but RF is rarely present.
2.
Felty’s syndrome consists of polyarticular RA associated
with splenomegaly and hypersplenism and consequent
haematologic derangements.

CHAPTER 28
The Musculoskeletal System
3.
Ankylosing spondylitis or rheumatoid spondylitis is
rheumatoid involvement of the spine, particularly sacroiliac
joints, in young male patients. The condition has a strong
HLA-B27 association and may have associated inflammatory
diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, anterior uveitis
and Reiter’s syndrome.
SUPPURATIVE ARTHRITIS
Infectious or suppurative arthritis is invariably an acute
inflammatory involvement of the joint. Bacteria usually reach
the joint space from the bloodstream but other routes of
infection by direct contamination of an open wound or
lymphatic spread may also occur. Immunocompromised and
debilitated patients are increasingly susceptible to
suppurative arthritis. The common causative organisms are
gonococci, meningococci, pneumococci, staphylococci,
streptococci, H. influenzae and gram-negative bacilli.
Clinically, the patients present with manifestations of any
local infection such as redness, swelling, pain and joint
effusion. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, neutrophilic
leucocytosis and raised ESR are generally associated.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The haematogenous infec-
tious joint involvement is more often monoarticular rather
than polyarticular. The large joints of lower extremities
such as the knee, hip and ankle, shoulder and
sternoclavicular joints are particularly favoured sites. The
process begins with hyperaemia, synovial swelling and
infiltration by polymorphonuclear and mononuclear
leucocytes alongwith development of effusion in the joint
space. There may be formation of inflammatory
granulation tissue and onset of fibrous adhesions between
the opposing articular surfaces resulting in permanent
ankylosis.
TUBERCULOUS ARTHRITIS
Tuberculous infection of the joints results most commonly
from haematogenous dissemination of the organisms from
pulmonary or other focus of infection. Another route of
infection is direct spread from tuberculous osteomyelitis close
to the joint. Uncommon in the West, the disease is seen not
infrequently in developing countries more commonly in
children and also in adults.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Tuberculous involvement
of the joints is usually monoarticular type but tends to be
more destructive than the suppurative arthritis. Most
commonly involved sites are the spine, hip joint and knees,
and less often other joints are affected. Tuberculosis of
the spine is termed Pott’s disease or tuberculous spondylitis.
Grossly, the affected articular surface shows deposition
of grey-yellow exudate and occasionally tubercles are
present. The joint space may contain tiny grey-white loose
bodies and excessive amount of fluid.
Histologically, the synovium is studded with solitary or
confluent caseating tubercles. The underlying articular
cartilage and bone may be involved by extension of
tuberculous granulation tissue and cause necrosis (caries).
GOUT AND GOUTY ARTHRITIS
Gout is a disorder of purine metabolism manifested by the
following features, occurring singly or in combination:
1.
Increased serum uric acid concentration (hyperuricaemia).
2.
Recurrent attacks of characteristic type of acute arthritis
in which crystals of monosodium urate monohydrate may be
demonstrable in the leucocytes present in the synovial fluid.
3.
Aggregated deposits of monosodium urate monohydrate
(tophi) in and around the joints of the extremities.
Figure 28.25
Rheumatoid arthritis. The characteristic histologic features are villous hypertrophy of the synovium and marked mononuclear
inflammatory cell infiltrate in synovial membrane with formation of lymphoid follicles at places.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
4.
Renal disease involving interstitial tissue and blood
vessels.
5.
Uric acid nephrolithiasis.
The disease usually begins in 3rd decade of life and affects
men more often than women. A family history of gout is
present in a fairly large proportion of cases indicating role of
inheritance in hyperuricaemia. Clinically, the natural history
of gout comprises 4 stages: asymptomatic hyperuricaemia,
acute gouty arthritis, asymptomatic intervals of intercritical
periods, and chronic tophaceous stage. In addition, gout
nephropathy and urate nephrolithiasis may occur (page 692).
TYPES AND PATHOGENESIS. The fundamental bio-
chemical hallmark of gout is hyperuricaemia. A serum uric
acid level in excess of 7 mg/dl, which represents the upper
limit of solubility of monosodium urate in serum at 37°C at
blood pH, is associated with increased risk of development
of gout. Thus, pathogenesis of gout is pathogenesis of hyper-
uricaemia.
Hyperuricaemia and gout may be classified into 2 types:
metabolic and renal, each of which may be primary or secondary.
Primary refers to cases in which the underlying biochemical
defect causing hyperuricaemia is not known, while secondary
denotes cases with known causes of hyperuricaemia.
1.
Hyperuricaemia of metabolic origin. This group
comprises about 10% cases of gout which are characterised
by overproduction of uric acid. There is either an accelerated
rate of purine biosynthesis de novo, or an increased turnover
of nucleic acids. The causes of primary metabolic gout include
a number of specific enzyme defects in purine metabolism
which may be either of unknown cause or are inborn errors
of metabolism. The secondary metabolic gout is due to either
increased purine biosynthesis or a deficiency of glucose-6-
phosphatase.
2.
Hyperuricaemia of renal origin. About 90% cases of gout
are the result of reduced renal excretion of uric acid. Altered
renal excretion could be due to reduced glomerular filtration
of uric acid, enhanced tubular reabsorption or decreased
secretion. The causes of gout of renal origin include diuretic
therapy, drug-induced (e.g. aspirin, pyrazinamide, nicotinic
acid, ethambutol and ethanol), adrenal insufficiency,
starvation, diabetic ketosis, and disorders of parathyroid and
thyroid. Renal disease per se rarely causes secondary
hyperuricaemia such as in polycystic kidney disease and
leads to urate nephropathy.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The pathologic mani-
festations of gout include: acute gouty arthritis, chronic
tophaceous arthritis, tophi in soft tissues, and renal lesions
as under:
1.
Acute gouty arthritis. This stage is characterised by
acute synovitis triggered by precipitation of sufficient
amount of needle-shaped crystals of monosodium urate
from serum or synovial fluid. There is joint effusion
containing numerous polymorphs, macrophages and
microcrystals of urates. The mechanism of acute
inflammation appears to include phagocytosis of crystals
by leucocytes, activation of the kallikrein system, activa-
tion of the complement system and urate-mediated
disruption of lysosomes within the leucocytes leading to
release of lysosomal products in the joint effusion. Initially,
there is monoarticular involvement accompanied with
intense pain, but later it becomes polyarticular along with
constitutional symptoms like fever. Acute gouty arthritis
is predominantly a disease of lower extremities, affecting
most commonly great toe. Other joints affected, in order
of decreasing frequency, are: the instep, ankles, heels,
knees, wrists, fingers and elbows.
2.
Chronic tophaceous arthritis. Recurrent attacks of
acute gouty arthritis lead to progressive evolution into
chronic arthritis. The deposits of urate encrust the articular
cartilage. There is synovial proliferation, pannus
formation and progressive destruction of articular
cartilage and subchondral bone. Deposits of urates in the
form of tophi may be found in the periarticular tissues.
3.
Tophi in soft tissue. A tophus (meaning ‘a porous
stone’) is a mass of urates measuring a few millimeters to
Figure 28.26
A gouty tophus, showing central aggregates of urate crystals surrounded by inflammatory cells, fibroblasts and occasional giant
cells.

855
CHAPTER 28
The Musculoskeletal System
a few centimeters in diameter. Tophi may be located in
the periarticular tissues as well as subcutaneously such
as on the hands and feet. Tophi are surrounded by
inflammatory reaction consisting of macrophages,
lymphocytes, fibroblasts and foreign body giant cells
(Fig. 28.26).
4.
Renal lesions. Chronic gouty arthritis frequently
involves the kidneys. Three types of renal lesions are
described in the kidneys: acute urate nephropathy, chronic
urate nephropathy and uric acid nephrolithiasis.
i)
Acute urate nephropathy is attributed to the intratubular
deposition of monosodium urate crystals resulting in acute
obstructive uropathy.
ii) Chronic urate nephropathy refers to the deposition of
urate crystals in the renal interstitial tissue.
iii) Uric acid nephrolithiasis is related to hyperuricaemia
resulting in hyperuricaciduria (page 692).
PSEUDOGOUT (PYROPHOSPHATE ARTHROPATHY)
Pseudogout refers to an inflammatory joint involvement due
to deposition of calcium pyrophosphate in the joint space.
The condition is seen in middle-aged and elderly individuals
of either sex. The pain is usually less severe and involvement
of big toe is rare. The pathogenesis is unclear but several
factors have been implicated. These include: associated
metabolic disease (e.g. hyperparathyroidism, hypothyroi-
dism, gout, ochronosis, Wilson’s disease and haemochroma-
tosis), heredity, familial occurrence, rheumatoid arthritis and
osteoarthritis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The involvement may be
monoarticular or polyarticular but large joints such as
knees, hips and shoulders are more often affected. The
joint effusion contains crystals of calcium pyrophosphate.
There is acute inflammatory response and deposits of
rhomboid crystals on the articular cartilage, ligaments,
tendons and joint capsule, termed chondrocalcinosis.
PIGMENTED VILLONODULAR SYNOVITIS AND
TENOSYNOVIAL GIANT CELL TUMOUR
(NODULAR TENOSYNOVITIS)
The terms ‘pigmented villonodular synovitis’ and ‘nodular
tenosynovitis’ represent diffuse and localised form
respectively of the same underlying process. The localised
form of lesion is also termed xanthofibroma or benign
synovioma. When the giant cells are numerous in localised
tenosynovitis, the condition is called giant cell tumour of tendon
sheath.
The origin and histogenesis of these conditions are
unknown. They were initially regarded as inflammatory in
origin and hence the name synovitis. But currently cyto-
genetic studies have shown clonal proliferation of cells
indicating that these lesions are neoplastic. Clinically, they
present with pain, swelling and limitation of movement of
the affected joint and may be easily mistaken for rheumatoid
or infective arthritis. The lesions are adequately treated by
excision but recurrences are common.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Though the two condi-
tions have many morphologic similarities, they are best
described separately.
 Giant cell tumour of tendon sheath (Nodular
tenosynovitis). The localised nodular tenosynovitis is seen
most commonly in the tendons of fingers.
Grossly, it takes the form of a solitary, circumscribed,
pedunculated, small and lobulated nodule, measuring less
than 2 cm in diameter. It is closely attached to and
sometimes grooved by the underlying tendon. On section,
the lesion is yellowish-brown.
Histologically, it is well encapsulated and is composed
of sheets of small oval to spindle-shaped cells, foamy
xanthoma cells, scattered multinucleate giant cells and
irregular bundles of collagen. Many of the spindle-shaped
cells are haemosiderin-laden (Fig. 28.27).
Pigmented villonodular tenosynovitis. This is a
diffuse form of synovial overgrowth seen most commonly
in the knee and hip.
Grossly, the synovium has characteristic sponge-like
reddish-brown or tan appearance with intermingled
elongated villous projections and solid nodules.
Histologically, the changes are modified by recurrent
injury. The enlarged villi are covered by hyperplastic
synovium and abundant subsynovial infiltrate of
lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages, many of
which are lipid-laden and haemosiderin-laden.
Multinucleate giant cells are scattered in these areas.
CYST OF GANGLION
A ganglion is a small, round or ovoid, movable, subcuta-
neous cystic swelling. The most common location is dorsum
of wrist but may be found on the dorsal surface of foot near
the ankle. Histogenesis of the ganglion is disputed. It may
be the result of herniated synovium, embryologically
displaced synovial tissue, or posttraumatic degeneration of
connective tissue.

infiltrate of small oval to spindled histiocytes with numerous interspersed
multinucleate giant cells lyning in a background of fibrous tissue.

856
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, a ganglion is a
small cyst filled with clear mucinous fluid. It may or may
not communicate with the joint cavity or tendon where it
is located.
Microscopically, the cyst has a wall composed of dense
or oedematous connective tissue which is sometimes lined
by synovial cells but more often has indistinct lining
(Fig. 28.28).
BURSITIS
Inflammation of bursa is termed bursitis. Bursae are synovial-
lined sacs found over bony prominences. Bursitis occurs
following mechanical trauma or inflammation. It may result
following a single injury such as olecranon bursitis and
prepatellar bursitis, but is more often due to repeated injuries
from excessive pressure such as in housemaid’s knee or tennis
elbow.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the bursal sac is
thick-walled and may contain watery, mucoid or granular
brown material.
Histologically, the bursal wall is composed of dense
fibrous tissue lined by inflammatory granulation tissue.
The wall is infiltrated by lymphocytes, plasma cells and
macrophages and may show focal calcium deposits.
SKELETAL MUSCLES
NORMAL STRUCTURE
Striated skeletal muscles consist of bundles of fibres called
fascicles, each of which is surrounded by connective tissue
sheath termed perimysium. Perimysium contains blood
vessels and nerve supply of the muscle fascicles. Each muscle
fibre is enveloped by delicate fibrous stroma called
endomysium.
Figure 28.28
Cyst of ganglion. The cyst wall is composed of dense
connective tissue lined internally by flattened lining. The cyst wall shows
myxoid degeneration.
Individual muscle fibre is an elongated multinucleated
syncytium-like cell about 100 μm in diameter and several
centimeters in length. The muscle nuclei are spindle-shaped
and lie at the periphery of fibre under the sarcolemma, the
plasma membrane of muscle fibre. The cytoplasm of the
muscle fibre contains myofilaments which are contractile
elements. Myofilaments are of 2 types—myosin comprising
thick filaments and actin constituting thin filaments. These
together produce cross-striations in muscle fibres seen in
longitudinal sections on light microscopy. Sarcomeres are the
partitions of myofilaments into equal zones. Each sarcomere
represents the distance between consecutive Z bands and
contains the central A (anisotropic) band, and the lateral I
(isotropic) bands.
The major functions of striated skeletal muscle are to
convert chemical energy into mechanical energy, to act as a
store of energy and proteins, and to play a role in the
metabolism of the body. The muscle, however, cannot
function as a contractile organ without a nerve supply. For
this purpose, there are motor units, each of which consists
of the following:
1.
Motor neuron cell body located in the spinal cord anterior
horn, or a cranial nerve nucleus.
2.
The axon of the motor neuron in the peripheral or cranial
nerve.
3.
The neuromuscular junction.
4.
The muscle fibres innervated by the motor neuron.
The muscle fibre contraction occurs by action potential
generated by chemical transmission of the impulse across
the synaptic gap by acetylcholine.
Skeletal muscles are affected in a number of systemic
diseases and pathologic processes such as ischaemia and
toxic (Zenker’s) necrosis; atrophy and hypertrophy;
degeneration and regeneration; and polymyositis, dermato-
myositis, and various forms of infective myositis (e.g. viral
myositis, pyogenic myositis, gas gangrene and parasitic
involvements such as cysticercosis). Most of the conditions
have been considered already in different chapters. Here, two
important groups of specific diseases—neurogenic and
myopathic diseases, are discussed. A classification of
neuromuscular disorders based on the part of the motor unit
involved is presented in Table 28.4.

CHAPTER 28
The Musculoskeletal System
NEUROGENIC DISEASES
The group of neurogenic diseases affecting skeletal muscles
is characterised by a combination of muscular weakness and
fatiguability. The most common of these is myasthenia
gravis; others are congenital myasthenia, an acquired Eaton-
Lambert syndrome associated with carcinoma of the lung,
and denervation atrophy.
MYASTHENIA GRAVIS
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disorder of
autoimmune origin in which the acetylcholine receptors
(AChR) in the motor end-plates of the muscles are damaged.
The term ‘myasthenia’ means ‘muscular weakness’ and ‘gravis’
implies ‘serious’; thus both together denote the clinical
characteristics of the disease. MG may be found at any age
but adult women are affected more often than adult men in
the ratio of 3:2. The condition presents clinically with
muscular weakness and fatiguability, initially in the ocular
musculature but later spreads to involve the trunk and limbs.
There is about 10% mortality in MG which is due to severe
generalised disease and involvement of respiratory muscles.
Several other autoimmune diseases have been found
associated with MG such as autoimmune thyroiditis,
rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, pernicious anaemia and collagen-
vascular diseases.
PATHOGENESIS. The pathogenesis of MG is best
understood in the context of normal muscle metabolism
(Fig. 28.29):
Normally, acetylcholine is synthesised in the motor nerve
terminal and stored in vesicles that are released
spontaneously when an action potential reaches the nerve
terminal. Acetylcholine from released vesicles combines with
AChRs, initiating an action potential which is propagated
along the muscle fibre triggering muscle contraction.
In MG, the basic defect is reduction in the number of
available AChRs at the postsynaptic muscle membrane. In
addition, the postsynaptic folds are flattened. These changes
result in decreased neuromuscular transmission leading to
failure to trigger muscle action potentials and consequent
weakened muscle contraction. The neuromuscular
abnormalities in MG are mediated by autoimmune response.
About 85-90% patients of MG have anti-AChR-antibodies in
their sera. These antibodies reduce the number of available
AChRs either by blocking the active sites of the receptors or
by damaging the post-synaptic muscle membrane in
collaboration with complement. The exact mechanism how
autoimmune response is initiated is not completely
understood but the thymus appears to play a role in this
process (page 388). Majority of patients of MG may have
either thymoma or thymic hyperplasia; thymectomy is
helpful in ameliorating the condition. The thymus possibly
sensitises B cells to produce anti-AChR antibodies.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the muscles
appear normal until late in the course of disease when
they become wasted.
By light microscopy, a few clumps of lymphocytes may
be found around small blood vessels. Degenerating
muscle fibres are present in half the cases.
Electron microscopy reveals reduction in synaptic area
of the motor axons due to flattening or simplification of
postsynaptic folds. The number of AChRs is greatly
reduced. By immunocytochemistry combined with
electron microscopy, it is possible to demonstrate the
complex of IgG and complement at the neuromuscular
junctions.
DENERVATION ATROPHY
If the muscle or a part of muscle is deprived of its motor
nerve supply, the affected muscle undergoes atrophy. In
demyelination, on the other hand, there is conduction block
in the nerve impulse but no denervation and hence muscle
atrophy does not occur.
Denervating diseases are characterised by axonal
degeneration and consequent muscle atrophy. These include
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as an example of anterior horn
cell disease, and peripheral neuropathy causing injury to
Figure 28.29
Neuromuscular junction in normal transmission (A) and in myasthenia gravis (B). The junction in MG shows reduced number of
AChRs, flattened and simplified postsynaptic folds, a widened synaptic space but a normal nerve terminal.

Systemic Pathology
myelinated axon. The clinical manifestations of denervation
atrophy are combination of muscular weakness and reduced
muscle bulk. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, there are
characteristic fasciculations of muscles of the shoulder and
tongue.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Denervation atrophy is
pathologically characterised by groups of small angulated
muscle fibres alternating with groups of plump, normal
or even hypertrophic fibres with intact innervation.
Further progression of the process may produce
superimposed changes of muscular dystrophy.

loss of fibres and replacement by interstitial fibrosis and adipose tissue.
MYOPATHIC DISEASES (MYOPATHIES)
Myopathies are primary skeletal muscle diseases resulting
in chronic muscle weakness. These are divided into 5 broad
groups: hereditary (muscular dystrophies), inflammatory,
endocrine, metabolic and toxic myopathies. Only the
hereditary myopathies, also termed muscular dystrophies,
are briefly considered below.
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHIES
Muscular dystrophies are a group of genetically-inherited
primary muscle diseases, having in common, progressive and

unremitting muscular weakness. Six major forms of muscular
dystrophies are described: Duchenne’s, Becker’s, myotonic,
facio-scapulohumeral, limb-girdle and oculopharyngeal type. Each
type of muscular dystrophy is a distinct entity having
differences in inheritance pattern, age at onset, clinical
features, other organ system involvements and clinical
course. These differences are summarised in Table 28.5.
However, in general, muscular dystrophies manifest in
childhood or in early adulthood. Family history of
neuromuscular disease is elicited in many cases.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Common to all forms of
muscular dystrophies are muscle fibre necrosis,
regenerative activity, replacement by interstitial fibrosis
and adipose tissue (Fig. 28.30).

Systemic Pathology
Soft Tissue Tumours
Chapter 29
Chapter 29
GENERAL FEATURES
INTRODUCTION. For the purpose of classification of this
group of tumours, the WHO has defined soft tissues as all
“non-epithelial extra-skeletal tissues of the body except the
reticuloendothelial system, the glia and the supporting
tissues of specific organs and viscera”. Thus, soft  tissues
included for the purpose of categorisation of their tumours
are: fibrous tissue, adipose tissue, muscle tissue, synovial
tissue, blood vessels and neuroectodermal tissues of the
peripheral and autonomic nervous system. The lesions of
these tissues are embryologically derived from mesoderm,
except those of peripheral nerve which are derived from ecto-
derm. Tumours of smooth muscle tissue, blood vessels and
nerves are described elsewhere in the book, while tumours
and tumour-like lesions composed of other soft tissues are
discussed in this chapter.
Benign soft tissue tumours are about 100 times more
common than sarcomas. Sarcomas rarely arise from malig-
nant transformation of a pre-existing benign tumour. Instead,
sarcomas originate from the primitive mesenchymal cells
having the capacity to differentiate along different cell path-
ways. As discussed in Chapter 8, soft tissue sarcomas
metastasise most frequently by the haematogenous route and
disseminate commonly to the lungs, liver, bone and brain.
Lymph node metastases are often late and are associated with
widespread dissemination of the tumour. Histologic differen-
tiation and grading of soft tissue sarcomas are important
because of varying clinical behaviour, prognosis and
response to therapy.
Majority of soft tissue tumours have following important
general features:
Superficially-located tumours tend to be benign while
deep-seated lesions are more likely to be malignant.
Large-sized tumours are generally more malignant than
small ones.
Rapidly-growing tumours often behave as malignant
tumours than those that develop slowly.
Malignant tumours have frequently increased vascularity
while benign tumours are selectively avascular.
Although soft tissue tumours may arise anywhere in the
body but in general more common locations are: lower
extremity (40%), upper extremity (20%), trunk and
retroperitoneum (30%) and head and neck (10%).
Generally, males are affected more commonly than
females.
Approximately 15% of soft tissue tumours occur in
children and include some specific examples of soft tissue
sarcomas e.g. rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS. Etiology of soft tissue
tumours remains largely unknown; however, a few common
features in etiology and pathogenesis apply to many soft
tissue tumours:
1. Frequently there is history of antecedent trauma which may
bring the tumour to attention of the patient.
2. Molecular and cytogenetic studies in many soft tissue
tumours reveal chromosomal abnormalities and mutations in
genes which can be used as a marker for diagnosis and
histogenesis e.g. translocations, various fusion genes etc.
3. Most of the soft tissue tumours occur sporadically; however
there are a few examples which are components of genetic
syndromes e.g. neurofibromatosis type 1, Li-Fraumeni
syndrome, Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome etc.
CLASSIFICATION.  Currently, the WHO classification
divides all soft tissue tumours into following 4 categories:
Benign: These soft tissue tumours generally do not recur and
are cured by complete excision. Common example is lipoma.
Intermediate, locally aggressive: These tumours are locally
destructive, infiltrative and often recur but do not
metastasise. Such tumours are generally treated by wide
excision; for example desmoid tumour.
Intermediate, rarely metstasising: This category of tumours
are also locally destructive, infiltrative and recurrent but in
addition about 2% cases may have clinical metastasis which
may not be predicted by morphology. Common example in
this category is dermtofibrosarcoma protuberans.
Malignant: Tumours in this category are clearly malignant—
they are locally destructive, infiltrative and metastasise in a
high percent of cases. The metastatic rate in low-grade
sarcomas is about 2-10% and in high-grade sarcomas is
20-100%.
DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA. Accurate pathological diagnosis
of soft tissue tumours is based on histogenesis which is
important for determining the prognosis and can be made
by the following plan:
1.
Cell patterns: Several morphological patterns in which
tumour cells are arranged are peculiar in different tumours
e.g.
i) Smooth muscle tumours: interlacing fascicles of pink staining
tumour cells.
ii) Fibrohistiocytic tumours: characteristically have storiform
pattern in which spindle tumour cells radiate from the centre
in a spoke-wheel manner.
iii) Herringbone pattern: is seen in fibrosarcoma in which
the tumour cells are arranged like the vertebral column of
seafish.

861
CHAPTER 29
Soft Tissue Tumours
iv) Pallisaded arrangement: is characteristically seen in
schwannomas in which the nuclei of tumour cells are piled
upon each other.
v) Biphasic pattern: is the term used for a combination
arrangement of two types—fascicles and epithelial-like e.g.
in synovial sarcoma.
2.
Cell types: After looking at the pattern of cells described
above, preliminary categorisation of soft tissue tumours is
done on the basis of cell types comprising the soft tissue
tumour:
i)
Spindle cells: These are the most common cell types in
most sarcomas. However, there are subtle differences in
different types of spindle cells e.g.
a) Fibrogenic tumours have spindle cells with light pink
cytoplasm and tapering-ended nuclei.
b) Neurogenic (Schwann cell) tumours have tumour cells similar
to fibrogenic cells but have curved nuclei.
c) Leiomyomatous tumours have spindle cells with blunt-ended
(cigar-shaped) nuclei and more intense eosinophilic
cytoplasm.
d) Skeletal muscle tumours have spindle cells similar to
leiomyomatous cells but in addition have cytoplasmic
striations.
ii) Small round cells: Some soft tissue sarcomas are
characterised by dominant presence of small round cells or
blue cells and are termed by various names such as malignant
small round cell tumours, round cell sarcomas, or blue cell
tumours (due to presence of lymphocyte-like round nuclear
size and dense blue chromatin). Examples of this group of
tumours are as under:
a) Rhabdomyosarcoma (embryonal and alveolar types)
b) Primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET)
c) Ewing’s sarcoma
d) Neuroblastoma
e) Malignant lymphomas.
A few examples of epithelial tumours such as small cell
carcinoma and malignant carcinoid tumours enter in the
differential diagnosis of small round cell tumours.
iii) Epithelioid cells: Some soft tissue tumours have either
epithelioid cells as the main cells (e.g. epithelioid sarcoma)
or have epithelial-like cells as a part of biphasic pattern of
the tumour (e.g. synovial sarcoma).
3. Immunohistochemistry: Soft tissue tumours are
distinguished by application of immunohistochemical stains.
Antibody stains are available against almost each cell
constituent. Based on differential diagnosis made on routine
morphology, the panel of antibody stains is chosen for
applying on paraffin sections for staining. Some common
examples are as under:
i) Smooth muscle actin (SMA): for smooth muscle tumours.
ii) Vimentin: as common marker to distinguish mesenchymal
cells from epithelium.
iii) Desmin: for skeletal muscle cells.
iv) S-100: for nerve fibres.
v) Factor VIII: antigen for vascular endothelium.
vi) LCA (leucocyte common antigen): common marker for
lymphoid cells.
4.
Electron microscopy: EM as such is mainly a research
tool and does not have much diagnostic value in soft tissue
tumours but can be applied sometimes to look for
tonofilaments or cell organelles.
5.
Cytogenetics: Many soft tissue tumours have specific
genetic and chromosomal changes which can be done for
determining histogenesis, or for diagnosis and prognosis.
GRADING. The number of pathological grades of soft tissue
tumours may vary according to different grading systems:
2 grade system (grade I-II as low and high grade), 3-grade
system (grade I, II, III as low, intermediate and high grade)
and 4 grade system (grade I-IV).  Pathological grading is
based on following 3 features:
i)
Tumour differentiation or degree of cytologic atypia
ii) Mitotic count
iii) Tumour necrosis
STAGING. Different staging systems for soft tissue sarcomas
have been described but two of the most accepted staging
systems are Enneking’s staging and American Joint Committee
(AJC) staging system:
Enneking’s staging: This staging system is accepted by most
oncologists and is based on grade and location of tumour as
under:
According to tumour location: T1 (intracompartmental) and
T2 (extracompartmental) tumours.
According to tumour grade : G1 (low grade) and G2 (high
grade) tumours.
Accordingly, the stages of soft tissue tumours vary from
stage I to stage III as under:
Stage I: G1 and T1-T2 tumours, but no metastases.
Stage II: G2 and T1 -T2 tumours, but without metstases.
Stage III: G1 or G2 , T1 or T2 tumours, but with metastases.
AJC staging: This AJC system of staging is similar to
staging for other tumours. It is based on TNM system in
which the primary tumor (T), the status of lymph nodes
(N) and presence or absence of metastases (M) are taken
into consideration for staging, besides the histologic grade
of the tumour.
After these brief general comments, some important
examples of tumours of different types of mesenchymal
tissue origin are described below.
TUMOURS AND TUMOUR-LIKE
LESIONS OF FIBROUS  TISSUE
Fibromas, fibromatosis and fibrosarcoma are benign, tumour-
like, and malignant neoplasms respectively, of fibrous
connective tissue.
FIBROMAS
True fibromas are uncommon tumours in soft tissues. Many
fibromas are actually examples of hyperplastic fibrous tissue
rather than true neoplasms. On the other hand, combinations
of fibrous growth with other mesenchymal tissue elements
are more frequent e.g. neurofibroma, fibromyoma etc.
Three types of fibromas are distinguished:

862
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
1.
Fibroma durum is a benign, often pedunculated and well-
circumscribed tumour occurring on the body surfaces and
mucous membranes. It is composed of fully matured and
richly collagenous fibrous connective tissue (Fig. 29.1).
2.
Fibroma molle or fibrolipoma, also termed soft fibroma,
is similar type of benign growth composed of mixture of
mature fibrous connective tissue and adult-type fat.
3.
Elastofibroma is a rare benign fibrous tumour located in
the subscapular region. It is characterised by association of
collagen bundles and branching elastic fibres.
FIBROMATOSIS
‘Fibromatosis’ is the term used for tumour-like lesions of
fibrous tissue which continue to proliferate actively and may
be difficult to differentiate from sarcomas. These lesions may,
therefore, be regarded as non-metastasising fibroblastic
tumours which tend to invade locally and recur after surgical
excision. In addition, electron microscopy has shown that
the cells comprising these lesions have features not only of
fibroblasts but of both fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells,
so called myofibroblasts. Depending upon the anatomic
locations and the age group affected, fibromatoses are
broadly grouped as under:
A. Infantile or juvenile fibromatoses include: fibrous
hamartoma of infancy, fibromatosis colli, diffuse infantile
fibromatosis, juvenile aponeurotic fibroma, juvenile
nasopharyngeal angiofibroma and congenital (generalised
and solitary) fibromatosis.
B. Adult type of fibromatoses are: palmar and plantar
fibromatosis, nodular fascitis, cicatricial fibromatosis, keloid,
irradiation fibromatosis, penile fibromatosis (Peyronie’s
disease), abdominal and extra-abdominal desmoid
fibromatosis, and retroperitoneal fibromatosis.
Obviously, it is beyond the scope of the present discus-
sion to cover all these lesions. Some of the important forms
of fibromatoses are briefly discussed here.
KELOID. A keloid is a progressive fibrous overgrowth in
response to cutaneous injury such as burns, incisions, insect
bites, vaccinations and others. Keloids are found more often
in blacks. Their excision is frequently followed by
recurrences.
Grossly, the keloid is a firm, smooth, pink, raised patch
from which extend claw-like processes (keloid-claw).
Histologically, it is composed of thick, homogeneous,
eosinophilic hyalinised bands of collagen admixed with
thin collagenous fibres and large active fibroblasts. The
adnexal structures are atrophic or destroyed.
There are some differences between a keloid and a
hypertrophic scar. A hypertrophic scar of the skin is more
cellular and has numerous fibroblasts than a keloid and is
composed of thinner collagenous fibres. A keloid is a
progressive lesion and liable to recurrences after surgical
excision.
NODULAR FASCITIS. Nodular fascitis, also called
pseudosarcomatous fibromatosis, is a form of benign and
reactive fibroblastic growth extending from superficial fascia
into the subcutaneous fat, and sometimes into the subjacent
muscle. The most common locations are the upper extremity,
trunk and neck region of young adults. Local excision is
generally curative. Less than 5% cases may have local
recurrence.
Grossly, the lesion appears as a solitary well-cirumscribed
nodule (true to its name) in the superficial fascia. The size
may vary from a centimeter to several centimeters in
diameter.
Microscopically, various morphologic patterns may be
seen but most common is a whorled or S-shaped pattern
of fibroblasts present in oedematous background. The
individual cells are spindle-shaped, plump fibroblasts
showing mild nuclear atypia. Typical mitoses are frequent
but atypical mitoses are not present.
PALMAR AND PLANTAR FIBROMATOSES. These
fibromatoses, also called Dupuytren-like contractures are the
most common form of fibromatoses occurring superficially.
Palmar fibromatosis is more common in the elderly males
occurring in the palmar fascia and leading to flexion
contractures of the fingers (Dupuytren’s contracture). It
appears as a painless, nodular or irregular, infiltrating,
benign fibrous subcutaneous lesion. In almost half the cases,
the lesions are bilateral.
Plantar fibromatosis is a similar lesion occurring on the
medial aspect of plantar arch. However, plantar lesions are
less common than palmar type and do not cause contractures
as frequently as palmar lesions. They are seen more often in
adults and are infrequently multiple and bilateral. Essentially
similar lesions occur in the shaft of the penis (penile
fibromatosis or Peyronie’s disease) and in the soft tissues of the
knuckles (knuckle pads).
Histologically, palmar and plantar fibromatoses have
similar appearance. The nodules are composed of
fibrovascular tissue having plump, tightly-packed fibro-
Figure 29.1
Fibroma of the oral cavity. The circumscribed lesion is
composed of mature collagenised fibrous connective tissue.

863
CHAPTER 29
Soft Tissue Tumours
blasts which have high mitotic rate. Ultrastructurally,
some of the fibroblasts have features of myofibroblasts
having contractile nature. The palmar lesions frequently
extend into soft tissues causing contractures. Both palmar
and plantar lesions may remain stationary at nodular
stage, progress, or regress spontaneously. Recurrence rate
after surgical excision in both forms is as high as 50-60%.
DESMOID FIBROMATOSES. Desmoid fibromatoses or
musculo-aponeurotic fibromatoses, commonly referred to as
desmoid tumours, are of 2 types: abdominal and extra-
abdominal. Both types are, however, histologically similar.
Clinically, both types behave in an aggressive manner and
have to be distinguished from sarcomas. Recurrences are
frequent and multiple. The pathogenesis of these lesions is
not known but among the factors implicated are the role of
antecedent trauma, genetic influences and relationship to
oestrogen as obsereved by occurrence of these lesions in
pregnancy.
Abdominal desmoids are locally aggressive infiltrating
tumour-like fibroblastic growths, often found in the musculo-
aponeurotic structures of the rectus muscle in the anterior
abdominal wall in women during or after pregnancy.
Extra-abdominal desmoids, on the other hand, are more
common in men and are widely distributed such as in the
upper and lower extremities, chest wall, back, buttocks, and
head and neck region.
Intra-abdominal desmoids present at the root of the small
bowel mesentery are associated with Gardner’s syndrome
(consisting of fibromatosis, familial intestinal polyposis,
osteomas and epidermal cysts).
Grossly, desmoids are solitary, large, grey-white, firm and
unencapsulated tumours infiltrating the muscle locally.
Cut surface is whorled and trabeculated.
Microscopically, their appearance is rather misleadingly
bland in contrast with aggressive local behaviour. They
are composed of uniform-looking fibroblasts arranged in
bands and fascicles. Pleomorphism and mitoses are
infrequent. The older regions of the tumour have hypo-
cellular hyalinised collagen.
FIBROSARCOMA
The number of soft tissue tumours diagnosed as fibrosarcoma
has now dropped, partly because of reclassification of
fibromatoses which have aggressive and recurrent behaviour,
and partly due to inclusion of many of such tumours in the
group of fibrous histiocytomas (described later).
Fibrosarcoma is a slow-growing tumour, affecting adults
between 4th and 7th decades of life. Most common locations
are the lower extremity (especially thigh and around the
knee), upper extremity, trunk, head and neck, and
retroperitoneum (Fig. 29.2). The tumour is capable of
metastasis, chiefly via the blood stream.
Figure 29.2
Fibrosarcoma, common clinical location.
Figure 29.3
Fibrosarcoma. Microscopy shows a  well-differentiated tumour composed of spindle-shaped cells forming interlacing fascicles
producing a typical Herring-bone pattern. A few mitotic figures are also seen.

864
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Grossly, fibrosarcoma is a grey-white, firm, lobulated and
characteristically circumscribed mass. Cut surface of the
tumour is soft, fishflesh-like, with foci of necrosis and
haemorrhages.
Histologically, the tumour is composed of uniform,
spindle-shaped fibroblasts arranged in intersecting
fascicles. In well-differentiated tumours, such areas
produce ‘herring-bone pattern’ (herring-bone is a sea fish)
(Fig. 29.3). Poorly-differentiated fibrosarcoma, however,
has highly pleomorphic appearance with frequent mitoses
and bizarre cells.
FIBROHISTIOCYTIC  TUMOURS
The group of fibrohistiocytic tumours is characterised by
distinctive light microscopic features that include presence
of cells with fibroblastic and histiocytic features in varying
proportion and identification of characteristic cart-wheel or
storiform pattern in which the spindle cells radiate outward
from the central focus. The histogenesis of these cells is
uncertain but possibly they arise from primitive
mesenchymal cells or facultative fibroblasts which are
capable of differentiating along different cell lines. The group
includes full spectrum of lesions varying from benign (benign
fibrous histiocytoma) to malignant (malignant fibrous
histiocytoma), with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans
occupying the intermediate (low-grade malignancy) position.
BENIGN FIBROUS HISTIOCYTOMA
Depending upon the location and predominant pattern,
benign fibrous histiocytomas include a number of diverse
entities such as dermatofibroma, sclerosing haemangioma,
fibroxanthoma, xanthogranuloma, giant cell tumour of
tendon sheath and pigmented villonodular synovitis. All
these tumours have mixed composition of benign fibroblastic
and histiocytic pattern of cells and have been described in
relevant sections already.
DERMATOFIBROSARCOMA PROTUBERANS
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a low-grade malignant
cutaneous tumour of fibrohistiocytic origin. The tumour
recurs locally, and in rare instances gives rise to distant
metastases. Most frequent location is the trunk.
Grossly, the tumour forms a firm, solitary or multiple,
satellite nodules extending into the subcutaneous fat and
having thin and ulcerated skin surface.
Histologically, the tumour is highly cellular and is
composed of fibroblasts arranged in a cart-wheel or
storiform pattern.
MALIGNANT FIBROUS HISTIOCYTOMA
Malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFH) represent approxi-
mately 20-30% of all soft tissue sarcomas. It is the most
common soft tissue sarcoma and is the most frequent sarcoma
associated with radiotherapy. The tumour occurs more
commonly in males and more frequently in the age group of
5th to 7th decades. Most common locations are the lower
and upper extremities and retroperitoneum. It begins as a
painless, enlarging mass, generally in relation to skeletal
muscle, deep fascia or subcutaneous tissue. The tumour is
believed to arise from primitive mesenchymal cells which
are capable of differentiating towards both fibroblastic and
histiocytic cell lines.
Grossly, MFH is a multilobulated, well-circumscribed,
firm or fleshy mass, 5-10 cm in diameter. Cut surface is
grey-white, soft and myxoid (Fig. 29.4).
Histologically, there is marked variation in appearance
from area to area within the same tumour. In general,
there is admixture of spindle-shaped fibroblast-like cells
and mononuclear round to oval histiocyte-like cells which
may show phagocytic function. There is tendency for the
spindle shaped cells to be arranged in characteristic cart-
wheel or storiform pattern. The tumour cells show
varying degree of pleomorphism, hyperchromatism,
mitotic activity and presence of multinucleate bizarre
tumour giant cells. Usually there are numerous blood
vessels and some scattered lymphocytes and plasma cells
(Fig. 29.5).  Important immunohistochemical markers for
MFH include vimentin, α-chymotrypsin, CD68 and
factor VIII-a.
Besides the storifrom pleomorphic MFH as the
prototype, a few morphologic variants of MFH having
bearing on prognosis include the following:
Myxoid MFH shows areas of loose myxoid stroma
in the cellular areas and has an overall better prognosis.
Inflammatory MFH is an undifferentiated high-grade
MFH having prominent neutrophilic infiltrate besides
the presence of eosinophils, histiocytes and xanthoma
cells.
Prognosis is determined by 2 parameters: depth of
location and size of the tumour. Deep-seated and large MFH

CHAPTER 29
Soft Tissue Tumours
such as of the retroperitoneum have poorer prognosis than
those small in size and located superficially which come to
attention earlier. Metastases are frequent, most often to the
lungs and regional lymph nodes. Five-year survival rate is
approximately 30-50%.
TUMOURS OF ADIPOSE  TISSUE
Lipomas and liposarcomas are the common examples of
benign and malignant tumours respectively of adipose tissue.
Uncommon varieties of adipose tissue tumours include
hibernoma, a benign tumour arising from brown fat, and
lipoblastoma (foetal lipoma) resembling foetal fat and found
predominantly in children under 3 years of age.
LIPOMA
Lipoma is the commonest soft tissue tumour. It appears as a
solitary, soft, movable and painless mass which may remain
stationary or grow slowly. Lipomas occur most often in 4th
to 5th decades of life and are frequent in females. They may
be found at different locations in the body but most common
sites are the subcutaneous tissues in the neck, back and
shoulder (Fig. 29.6,A). A lipoma rarely ever transforms into
liposarcoma.
Grossly, a subcutaneous lipoma is usually small, round
to oval and encapsulated mass. The cut surface is soft,
lobulated, yellowish-orange and greasy (Fig. 29.6, B).
Histologically, the tumour is composed of lobules of
mature adipose cells separated by delicate fibrous septa.
A thin fibrous capsule surrounds the tumour (Fig. 29.7).
A variety of admixture of lipoma with other tissue
components may be seen. These include: fibrolipoma
(admixture with fibrous tissue), angiolipoma (combination
with proliferating blood vessels) and myelolipoma
(admixture with bone marrow elements as seen in adrenals).
Infrequently, benign lipoma may infiltrate the striated muscle
(infiltrating or intramuscular lipoma). Spindle cell lipoma
and pleomorphic (atypical) lipoma are the other unusual
variants of lipoma. The latter type may be particularly
difficult to distinguish from well-differentiated liposarcoma.
Figure 29.5
Malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The tumour shows admixture of spindle-shaped pleomorphic cells forming storiform (cart-wheel)
pattern and histiocyte-like round to oval cells. Bizarre pleomorphic multinucleate tumour giant cells and some mononuclear inflammatory cells are
also present.

866
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
LIPOSARCOMA
Liposarcoma is one of  the most common soft tissue
sarcomas in adults, perhaps next in frequency only to
malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Unlike lipoma which
originates from mature adipose cells, liposarcoma arises
from primitive mesenchymal cells, the lipoblasts. The peak
incidence is in 5th to 7th decades of life. In contrast to
lipomas which are more frequently subcutaneous in
location, liposarcomas often occur in the deep tissues. Most
frequent sites are intermuscular regions in the thigh,
buttocks and retroperitoneum.
Grossly, liposarcoma appears as a nodular mass, 5 cm or
more in diameter. The tumour is generally circumscribed
but infiltrative. Cut surface is grey-white to yellow,
myxoid and gelatinous. Retroperitoneal masses are
generally much larger.
Histologically, the hallmark of diagnosis of liposarcoma
is the identification of variable number of lipoblasts which
may be univacuolated or multivacuolated (Fig. 29.4). The
vacuoles represent fat in the cytoplasm. Four major
histologic varieties of liposarcomas are distinguished:
well-differentiated, myxoid, round cell, and pleomorphic
(Fig. 29.8):
1.
Well-differentiated liposarcoma resembles lipoma but
contains uni- or multi-vacuolated lipoblasts.
2.
Myxoid liposarcoma is the most common histologic type.
It is composed of monomorphic, fusiform or stellate cells
representing primitive mesenchymal cells, lying dispersed
in mucopolysaccharide-rich ground substance. Occasional
tumour giant cells may be present. Prominent meshwork
of capillaries forming chicken-wire pattern is a
conspicuous feature.

photomicrograph shows close-up view of a typical lipoblast having multivacuolated cytoplasm indenting the atypical nucleus.

867
CHAPTER 29
Soft Tissue Tumours
3.
Round cell liposarcoma is composed of uniform, round
to oval cells having fine multivacuolated cytoplasm with
central hyperchromatic nuclei. Round cell liposarcoma
may resemble a signet-ring carcinoma but mucin stains
help in distinguishing the two.
4.
Pleomorphic liposarcoma is highly undifferentiated and
the most anaplastic type. There are numerous large
tumour giant cells and bizarre lipoblasts.
The prognosis of liposarcoma depends upon the location
and histologic type. In general, well-differentiated and
myxoid varieties have excellent prognosis, while
pleomorphic liposarcoma has significantly poorer prognosis.
Round cell and pleomorphic variants metastasise frequently
to the lungs, other visceral organs and serosal surfaces.
SKELETAL MUSCLE  TUMOURS
Rhabdomyoma and rhabdomyosarcoma are the benign and
malignant tumours respectively of striated muscle.
RHABDOMYOMA
Rhabdomyoma is a rare benign soft tissue tumour. It should
not be confused with glycogen-containing lesion of the heart
designated as cardiac rhabdomyoma which is probably a
hamartomatous lesion and not a true tumour. Soft tissue
rhabdomyomas are predominantly located in the head and
neck, most often in the upper neck, tongue, larynx and
pharynx.
Histologically, the tumour is composed of large, round
to oval cells, having abundant, granular, eosinophilic
cytoplasm which is frequently vacuolated and contains
glycogen. Cross-striations are generally demonstrable in
some cells with phosphotungstic acid-haematoxylin
(PTAH) stain. The tumour is divided into adult and foetal
types, depending upon the degree of resemblance of
tumour cells to normal muscle cells.
RHABDOMYOSARCOMA
Rhabdomyosarcoma is a much more common soft tissue
tumour than rhabdomyoma, and is the commonest soft tissue
sarcoma in children and young adults. It is a highly malignant
tumour arising from rhabdomyoblasts in varying stages of
differentiation with or without demonstrable cross-striations.
Depending upon the growth pattern and histology, 4 types
are distinguished: embryonal, botryoid, alveolar and
pleomorphic.
1.
EMBRYONAL RHABDOMYOSARCOMA. The
embryonal form is the most common of the rhabdo-
myosarcomas. It occurs predominantly in children under 12
years of age. The common locations are in the head and neck
region, most frequently in the orbit, urogenital tract and the
retroperitoneum.
Grossly, the tumour forms a gelatinous mass growing
between muscles or in the deep subcutaneous tissues but
generally has no direct relationship to the skeletal muscle.
Histologically, the tumour cells have resemblance to
embryonal stage of development of muscle fibres. There
is considerable variation in cell types. Generally, the
tumour consists of a mixture of small, round to oval cells
and spindle-shaped strap cells having tapering bipolar
cytoplasmic processes in which cross-striations may be
evident. The tumour cells form broad fascicles or bands.
Mitoses are frequent.
2.
BOTRYOID RHABDOMYOSARCOMA. Botryoid
variety is regarded as a variant of embryonal rhabdomyo-
sarcoma occurring in children under 10 years of age. It is
seen most frequently in the vagina, urinary bladder and nose
(page 724).
Grossly, the tumour forms a distinctive grape-like
gelatinous mass protruding into the hollow cavity.
Histologically, the tumour grows underneath the muco-
sal layer, forming the characteristic cambium layer of
tumour cells. The tumour is hypocellular and myxoid with
predominance of small, round to oval tumour cells
(Fig. 29.9).
3.
ALVEOLAR RHABDOMYOSARCOMA. Alveolar type
of rhabdomyosarcoma is more common in older children and
young adults under the age of 20 years. The most common
locations, unlike the embryonal variety, are the extremities.
Grossly, the tumour differs from embryonal type in arising
directly from skeletal muscle and grows rapidly as soft
and gelatinous mass.
Histologically, the tumour shows characteristic alveolar
pattern resembling pulmonary alveolar spaces. These
spaces are formed by fine fibrocollagenous septa. The
tumour cells lying in these spaces and lining the fibrous

Systemic Pathology
trabeculae are generally small, lymphocyte-like with
frequent mitoses and some multinucleate tumour giant
cells (Fig. 29.10). Cross-striation can be demonstrated in
about a quarter of cases.
4.
PLEOMORPHIC RHABDOMYOSARCOMA. This less
frequent 
variety 
of 
rhabdomyosarcoma 
occurs
predominantly in older adults above the age of 40 years. They
are most common in the extremities, most frequently in the
lower limbs.
Grossly, the tumour forms a well-circumscribed, soft,
whitish mass with areas of haemorrhages and necrosis.
Histologically, the tumour cells show considerable
variation in size and shape. The tumour is generally
composed of highly anaplastic cells having bizarre
appearance and numerous multinucleate giant cells.
Various shapes include racquet shape, tadpole appear-
ance, large strap cells, and ribbon shapes containing
several nuclei in a row.
Conventionally, the cross-striations can be demons-
trated with PTAH stain in a few rhabdomyosracomas.
Immunohistochemical stains include: myogenin, Myo-D1,
desmin, actin, myosin, myoglobin, and vimentin.
TUMOURS OF UNCERTAIN HISTOGENESIS
Some soft tissue tumours have a distinctive morphology but
their exact histogenesis is unclear. A few examples are
described below.
SYNOVIAL SARCOMA (MALIGNANT SYNOVIOMA)
Whether true benign tumours of synovial tissue exist is
controversial. Pigmented villonodular synovitis and giant
cell tumours of tendon sheaths, both of which are tumour-
like lesions of synovial tissues are discussed already on page
855. Synovial sarcoma or malignant synovioma, on the other
hand, is a distinctive soft tissue sarcoma arising from
synovial tissues close to the large joints, tendon sheaths,
bursae and joint capsule but almost never arising within
joint cavities. Most common locations are the extremities,
frequently the lower extremity. However, synovial sarcoma
is also found in regions where synovial tissue is not present
such as in the anterior abdominal wall, parapharyngeal
region and the pelvis. The tumour principally occurs in
young adults, usually under 40 years of age. The tumour
grows slowly as a painful mass but may metastasise via
blood stream, chiefly to the lungs.
The histogenesis of tumour is, believed to be from
multipotent mesenchymal cells which may differentiate
along different cell lines.
Grossly, the tumour is of variable size and is grey-white,
round to multilobulated and encapsulated. Cut surface
shows fishflesh-like sarcomatous appearance with foci of
calcification, cystic spaces and areas of haemorrhages and
necrosis.
Microscopically, classic synovial sarcoma shows a
characteristic biphasic cellular pattern composed of clefts
or gland-like structures lined by cuboidal to columnar
epithelial-like cells and plump to oval spindle cells
(Fig. 29.11). Reticulin fibres are present around spindle
cells but absent within the epithelial foci. The spindle cell
areas form interlacing bands similar to those seen in
fibrosarcoma. Myxoid matrix, calcification and
hyalinisation are frequently present in the stroma. Mitoses
and multinucleate giant cells are infrequent. Immuno-
histochemically, both types of tumour cells are positive
for cytokeratin.
An uncommon variant of synovial sarcoma is monophasic
pattern in which the epithelial component is exceedingly rare
and thus the tumour may be difficult to distinguish from
fibrosarcoma.
Figure 29.10
Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. The tumour is divided into alveolar spaces composed of fibrocollagenous tissue. The fibrous
trabeculae are lined by small, dark, undifferentiated tumour cells, with some cells floating in the alveolar spaces. A few multinucleate tumour giant
cells are also present.

CHAPTER 29
Soft Tissue Tumours
ALVEOLAR SOFT PART SARCOMA
Alveolar soft part sarcoma is a histologically distinct, slow-
growing malignant tumour of uncertain histogenesis. The
tumour may occur at any age but affects children and young
adults more often. Most alveolar soft part sarcomas occur in
the deep tissues of the extremities, along the musculofascial
planes, or within the skeletal muscles.
Grossly, the tumour is well-demarcated, yellowish and
firm.
Microscopically, the tumour shows characteristic alveo-
lar pattern. Organoid masses of tumour cells are separated
by fibrovascular septa. The tumour cells are large and
regular and contain abundant, eosinophilic, granular
cytoplasm which contains diastase-resistant PAS-positive
material. This feature distinguishes the tumour from
paraganglioma, with which it closely resembles.
GRANULAR CELL MYOBLASTOMA
Granular cell tumour is a benign tumour of unknown histo-
genesis. It may occur at any age but most often affected are
young to middle-aged adults. The most frequent locations
are the tongue and subcutaneous tissue of the trunk and
extremities.
Grossly, the tumour is generally small, firm, grey-white
to yellow-tan nodular mass.
Histologically, the tumour consists of nests or ribbons of
large, round or polygonal, uniform cells having finely
granular, acidophilic cytoplasm and small dense nuclei.
The tumours located in the skin are frequently associated
with pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia of the overlying
skin.
EPITHELIOID SARCOMA
This soft tissue sarcoma occurring in young adults is peculiar
in that it presents as an ulcer with sinuses, often located on
Figure 29.11
Classic synovial sarcoma, showing characteristic biphasic cellular pattern. The tumour is composed of epithelial-like cells lining
cleft-like spaces and gland-like structures, and spindle cell areas forming fibrosarcoma-like growth pattern.
the skin and subcutaneous tissues as a small swelling. The
tumour is slow growing but metastasising.
Grossly, the tumour is somewhat circumscribed and has
nodular appearance with central necrosis.
Microscopically, the tumour cells comprising the nodules
have epithelioid appearance by having abundant pink
cytoplasm and the centres of nodules show necrosis and
thus can be mistaken for a granuloma.
CLEAR CELL SARCOMA
Clear cell sarcoma, first described by Enginzer, is seen in
skin and subcutaneous tissues, especially of hands and feet.
Microscopically, it closely resembles malignant
melanoma, and is therefore also called melanoma of the
soft tissues.
TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS
Besides the soft tissue tumours, there are some proliferative
conditions of the soft tissues which resemble clinically and
morphologically with soft tissue tumours. Important
examples are nodular fascitis (pseudosarcomatous fascitis)
and myositis ossificans. The former condition has already
been described under fibromatous lesions while the latter is
discussed below.
MYOSITIS OSSIFICANS
Myositis ossificans is a benign, tumour-like lesion
characterised by osteoid and heterotopic bone formation in
the soft tissues. It is a misnomer since the lesion neither occurs
exclusively in the skeletal muscle as the name leads one to
believe, nor are the inflammation or ossification always
essential.
Myositis ossificans is generally preceded by history of
antecedent trauma to a skeletal muscle or its tendon. The
trauma may be minor and repetitive e.g. to the adductor

870

Systemic Pathology
muscles of the thigh of a horseman, or may be single injury
followed by haemorrhage into the muscle. The patient
generally complains of pain, tenderness and swelling.
Richly vascularised granulation tissue replaces the affected
muscle or tendon. Then follows development of osteoid
and bone at the periphery, giving characteristic X-ray
appearance.
Grossly, the lesion appears as unencapsulated, gritty mass
replacing the muscle.
Histologically, the central region of the mass shows
loosely-arranged fibroblasts having high mitotic activity.
Towards the periphery, there is presence of osteoid matrix
and formation of woven mineralised bone with trapped
skeletal muscle fibres and regenerating muscle (myogenic)
giant cells. The appearance is sufficiently atypical to
suggest osteosarcoma but osteosarcoma lacks maturation
phenomena seen in myositis ossificans. This is why the
condition is also called pseudomalignant osseous tumour of
the soft tissues.

The Nervous System
The Nervous System
Chapter 30
Chapter 30
CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The skull and the vertebrae form a rigid compartment
encasing the delicate brain and spinal cord. The average
weight of the brain is about 1400 gm in men and 1250 gm in
women. The two main divisions of the brain— the cerebrum
and the cerebellum, are quite distinct in structure. The brain
does not have lymphatic drainage. There are 2 types of tissues
in the nervous system:
1.
Neuroectodermal tissues which include neurons (nerve
cells) and neuroglia, and together form the predominant
constituent of the CNS.
2.
Mesodermal tissues are microglia, dura mater, the lepto-
meninges (pia-arachnoid), blood vessels and their
accompanying mesenchymal cells.
The predominant tissues comprising the nervous system
and their general response to injury are briefly considered
below:
1.
NEURONS. The neurons are highly specialised cells of
the body which are incapable of dividing after the first few
weeks of birth. Thus, brain damage involving the neurons is
irreversible. Neurons vary considerably in size and shape.
Their size may range from the small granular cells of the
cerebellum to large Betz cells of the motor cortex. Some
neurons are round, others oval or fusiform but the prototype
of cortical neuron is pyramidal in shape. A neuron consists
of 3 main parts: the cell body, an axon and numerous
dendrites (Fig. 30.1,A). The cell body (or perikaryon) is the
main constituent of the neuron from which an axon and
numerous dendritic processes extend. The cell bodies may
be arranged in layers as in the cerebral cortex, or may be
aggregated as in the basal ganglia. The cell body possesses a
large, round, centrally-placed nucleus having finely granular
nuclear chromatin and a prominent nucleolus. The cytoplasm
contains polygonal, basophilic structures called Nissl
substance. It consists of aggregates of RNA, sheaves of rough
endoplasmic reticulum and intervening groups of free
ribosomes. Besides Nissl substance, other special features of
the cytoplasm of neuronal cell body are the presence of
microtubules, synaptic vesicles and neurofilaments which
are a form of intermediate filaments specific to neurons.
Lipofuscin may be present due to ageing. Neuromelanin is
found in neurons in the substantia nigra and pigmented
nucleus of the pons.
Neurons respond to injury in a variety of ways depen-
ding upon the etiologic agent and the pathologic processes.
These include central chromatolysis, atrophy and
degeneration of neurons and axons, and intraneuronal
storage of substances.
Neuropil is the term used for the fibrillar network formed
by processess of all the neuronal cells.
2.
NEUROGLIA. The neuroglia provides supportive matrix
and maintenance to the neurons. It includes 3 types of cells:
astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and ependymal cells
(Fig. 30.1,B). Neuroglia is generally referred to as glia; the
Figure 30.1
Cells comprising the nervous system.

872
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
tumours originating from it are termed gliomas, and reactive
proliferation of the astrocytes being called gliosis.
i)
Astrocytes. The astrocytes are stellate cells with
numerous fine branching processes. In routine haematoxylin
and eosin stains, an astrocyte has round or oval vesicular
nucleus, but unlike neuron, lacks a prominent nucleolus. The
cytoplasm is generally scanty. The processes radiate from
the cell body. Depending upon the type of processes, two
types of astrocytes are distinguished:
Protoplasmic astrocytes have branched processes and are
found mostly in the grey matter.
Fibrous astrocytes have long, thin processes and are present
mainly in the white matter.
Some astrocytic processes are directed towards neurons
and their processes, which others surround capillaries by
terminal expansions called foot processes. The astrocytic
processes may not be visible by routine stains but can be
demonstrated by phosphotungstic acid haematoxylin
(PTAH) stain. Ultrastructurally, these processes are
composed of abundant intermediate filaments, mostly
vimentin.
The main functions of astrocytes in health are physio-
logical and biochemical support to the neurons and
interactions with capillary endothelial cells to establish blood
brain barrier. In case of damage to the brain, astrocytes act
like fibroblasts of other tissues. The astrocytes in respond to
injury undergo hyperplasia and hypertrophy termed ‘gliosis’
which is an equivalent of scar elsewhere in the body.
Gemistocytic astrocytes are early reactive astrocytes having
prominent pink cytoplasm. Long-standing progressive
gliosis results in the development of Rosenthal fibres which
are eosinophilic, elongated or globular bodies present on the
astrocytic processes.
Corpora amylacea are basophilic, rounded, sometimes
laminated bodies, present in elderly people in the white
matter and result from accumulation of starch-like material
in the degenerating astrocytes.
ii) Oligodendrocytes. Oligodendrocytes are so named
because of their short and fewer processes when examined
by light microscopy with special stains (oligo=short). In
haematoxylin-eosin stained sections, these cells appear as
small cells with a darkly-staining nucleus resembling that of
small lymphocyte. The cytoplasm appears as a clear halo
around the nucleus. Oligodendrocytes are present
throughout the brain in grey as well as white matter and are
most numerous of all other cells in the CNS. In grey matter,
they are clustered around the neurons and are called satellite
cells. In white matter, they are present along the myelinated
nerve fibres and are termed interfascicular oligodendroglia.
The major function of oligodendrocytes is formation and
maintenance of myelin. Thus, in this respect they are
counterparts of Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous
system. Diseases of oligodendrocytes are, therefore, disorders
of myelin and myelinisation such as inherited leucodys-
trophies and acquired demyelinating diseases.
iii) Ependymal cells. The ependymal cells are epithelium-
like and form a single layer of cells lining the ventricular
system, aqueduct, central canal of the spinal cord and cover
the choroid plexus. They are cuboidal to columnar cells and
have ciliated luminal surface, just beneath which are present
small bodies termed blepharoplasts.
The ependymal cells influence the formation and
composition of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by processes of
active secretion, diffusion, absorption and exchange. The
function of cilia is not very clear but probably they play a
role in the circulation of CSF. The ependymal cells respond
to injury by cell loss and the space left is filled by proliferation
of underlying glial fibres.
3.
MICROGLIA. Microglia is the nervous system counter-
part of the monocyte-macrophage system. Although the term
‘microglia’ is commonly used but it is inappropriate since
these cells, unlike neuroglia, are not of neuroectodermal
origin. Microglial cells (or Hortega cells) are not fixed but
are mobile cells. These cells are found throughout the brain
and are often present close to the blood vessels. Normally,
microglial cells appear as small inconspicuous cells with
bean-shaped vesicular nuclei, scanty cytoplasm and long
cytoplasmic processes (Fig. 30.1,C). In response to injury or
damage, however, these cells have capability to enlarge in
size, proliferate and develop elongated nuclei, so called rod
cells. Microglial cells may actually assume the shape and
phagocytic function of macrophages and form gitter cells. The
foci of necrosis and areas of selective hypoxic damage to the
neurons are surrounded by microglial cells which perform
phagocytosis of damaged and necrosed cells; this is known
as neuronophagia.
4.
DURA MATER. The dura mater is a tough fibrous
covering of the brain which is closely attached to the skull
on its inner layer of endocranial periosteum. In the region of
spinal canal, it encloses a potential space, the epidural space,
between the bone and the dura. The dura is composed of
dense collagen, fused with periosteum of the skull.
5. PIA-ARACHNOID (LEPTOMENINGES). The lepto-
meninges (lepto=thin, slender) consisting of the pia and
arachnoid mater form the delicate vascular membranous
covering of the central nervous system. The pia mater is
closely applied to the brain and its convolutions, while the
arachnoid mater lies between the pia mater and the dura
mater without dipping into sulci. Thus, a space is left between
the two layers of leptomeninges, known as subarachnoid space,
which contains the CSF. The major arteries and veins run in
the subarachnoid space and small nutrient arteries pass into
the cortex. Extension of the subarachnoid space between the
wall of blood vessels entering the brain and their pial sheaths
form a circumvascular space called Virchow-Robin space.
Another important potential space is enclosed between the
dura and the arachnoid membrane known as subdural space.
DEVELOPMENTAL ANOMALIES
These malformations are the result of various inherited and
acquired factors. The acquired conditions include viral
infections of the mother and foetus (e.g. rubella), intake of
drugs (e.g. thalidomide), exposure to ionising radiation and
foetal anoxia. There are a large number of developmental

873
CHAPTER 30
The Nervous System
malformations of the CNS but only a few important and
common ones are mentioned here. Congenital hydrocephalus
is considered separately along with other types of hydro-
cephalus.
Spinal Cord Defects
Spina bifida is the term applied to the malformations of the
vertebral column involving incomplete embryologic closure
of one or more of the vertebral arches (rachischisis), most
frequently in the lumbosacral region. The vertebral defect is
frequently associated with defect in the neural tube structures
and their coverings. The bony defect may be of varying
degree. The least serious form is spina bifida occulta in which
there is only vertebral defect but no abnormality of the spinal
cord and its meninges. The site of bony defect is marked by
a small dimple, or a hairy pigment mole in the overlying
skin. The larger bony defect, however, appears as a distinct
cystic swelling over the affected site called spina bifida
cystica. This is associated with herniation of the meninges
or the spinal cord, or both.
Herniation of the meninges alone through the bony
defect, meningocele, is a less common variety. The herni-
ated sac in meningocele consists of dura and arachnoid.
The commonest and more serious form is, however,
meningomyelocele in which the spinal cord or its roots also
herniate through the defect and are attached to the posterior
wall of the sac. In this defect, the dura and the skin in the sac
are deficient. A more serious variant of meningomyelocele
is associated with hydrocephalus and Arnold-Chiari
malformation.
A rare form of the defect is myelocele or syringo-
myelocele in which there is defective closure of the spinal
canal so that the sac consists of an open flat neural tissue
plate without skin covering and the CSF leaking through it.
Meningomyelocele and myelocele are frequently asso-
ciated with neurologic defects of varying degree which
include bladder and bowel dysfunction, motor and sensory
defects, and paraplegia.
The existence of defect in bony closure in the region of
occipital bone or fronto-ethmoid junction may result in
cranial meningocele and encephalocele.
Syringomyelia and Syringobulbia
These are congenital malformations which manifest clinically
later in life and often develop in association with certain
acquired lesions involving the CNS. Syringomyelia and
syringobulbia are characterised by development of a syrinx
or a tubular cavity in the spinal cord and medulla
respectively. The cavity may be fusiform or irregular. It
usually begins in the grey matter of the spinal cord dorsal to
the central canal. The syrinx is usually surrounded by glial
tissue. If the cavity communicates with the spinal canal, it is
lined by ependymal cells. Since the fibres of lateral spino-
thalamic tract are frequently involved in the cavity, the
clinical effects include loss of pain and temperature sensation
in the affected region.
Arnold-Chiari Malformations
Arnold-Chiari malformation is the term used for a group of
malformations of the brain involving the brainstem and
cerebellum. The primary defect is elongation of the medulla
and part of the vermis of the cerebellum resulting from failure
of the pontine flexure to form. Approximately 50% of children
with hydrocephalus have the Arnold-Chiari malformation.
Four types are described, of which type II malformation is
the most common and is most frequently associated with
congenital hydrocephalus. Most patients of Arnold-Chiari
malformation have, in addition, meningomyelocele. The
major components of type II Arnold-Chiari malformation are
as follows:
1.
Elongation of the medulla with part of fourth ventricle
in the cervical canal.
2.
Distortion of the medulla forming a characteristic S-
shaped bend at the junction with the cervical spinal cord.
3.
Lengthening and herniation of the cerebellar vermis and
cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum resulting in
formation of a mass over the upper cervical cord.
Combination of these abnormalities results in stenosis of
the aqueduct or obstruction of the foramina of Luschka and
Magendie causing internal hydrocephalus (discussed below).
HYDROCEPHALUS
Hydrocephalus is the term used for increased volume of CSF
within the skull, accompanied by dilatation of the ventricles.
In majority of cases of hydrocephalus, there is increased
intracranial pressure. This type of hydrocephalus involving
ventricular dilatation is termed internal hydrocephalus. A
localised collection of CSF in the subarachnoid space is called
external hydrocephalus. For better understanding of causes and
mechanisms involved in the hydrocephalus, it is essential to
briefly review the source and circulation of CSF.
Source and Circulation of CSF
CSF is mainly produced by choroid plexus in the lateral, third
and fourth ventricle, and a small part is formed on the surface
of the brain and spinal cord. The total volume of CSF is about
120-150 ml. CSF formed in the lateral ventricles flows through
the foramina of Munro to the third ventricle and from there
by the aqueduct of Sylvius to the fourth ventricle. The fluid
then passes through the foramina of Magendie and Luschka
of the fourth ventricle to reach the subarachnoid space of the
brain. It then spreads through the subarachnoid space over
the surface of the spinal cord. It is absorbed into the blood
by the arachnoid villi present along the dural venous sinuses
(Fig. 30.2).
Types and Etiopathogenesis
Hydrocephalus is classified into primary and secondary
types, the former being much more common, both types have
distinct etiology and pathogenesis.
PRIMARY HYDROCEPHALUS. Primary hydrocephalus is
defined as actual increase in the volume of CSF within the
skull along with elevated intracranial pressure. There are 3
possible mechanisms of primary hydrocephalus:

874
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
1.
Obstruction to the flow of CSF.
2.
Overproduction of CSF.
3.
Deficient reabsorption of CSF.
However, obstruction to the flow of CSF is by far the
commonest cause and is termed obstructive hydrocephalus. The
terms non-communicating and communicating hydrocephalus
are used to denote the site of obstruction:
Non-communicating hydrocephalus. When the site of
obstruction of CSF pathway is in the third ventricle or at the
exit foramina in the fourth ventricle, the ventricular system
enlarges and CSF cannot pass into the subarachnoid space.
This is termed as non-communicating hydrocephalus.
Among the common causes are the following:
i)
Congenital non-communicating hydrocephalus e.g. stenosis
of the aqueduct, Arnold-Chiari malformation, progressive
gliosis of the aqueduct and intra-uterine meningitis.
ii) Acquired non-communicating hydrocephalus may occur from
expanding lesion within the skull. These conditions are as
under:
Tumours adjacent to the ventricular system e.g.
ependymoma, choroid plexus papilloma, medullo-
blastoma and others.
Inflammatory lesions e.g. cerebral abscess, meningitis.
Haemorrhage e.g. parenchymal haemorrhage, intra-
ventricular haemorrhage, and epidural and subdural
haematoma.
Communicating hydrocephalus. When obstruction to the
flow of CSF is in the subarachnoid space at the base of the
brain, it results in enlargement of the ventricular system but
CSF flows freely between dilated ventricles and the spinal
canal. This is called communicating hydrocephalus. The
causes of communicating hydrocephalus are non-obstructive
which are as follows:
i)
Overproduction of CSF e.g. choroid plexus papilloma.
ii) Deficient reabsorption of CSF e.g. following meningitis, sub-
arachnoid haemorrhage and dural sinus thrombosis.
SECONDARY HYDROCEPHALUS. Secondary hydro-
cephalus is much less common and is defined as compen-
satory increase of CSF due to loss of neural tissue without
associated rise in intracranial pressure (normal pressure
hydrocephalus) e.g. from cerebral atrophy and infarction.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, there is dilatation
of the ventricles depending upon the site of obstruction.
There is thinning and stretching of the brain. The scalp
veins overlying the enlarged head are engorged and the
fontanelle remain open.
Histologically, severe hydrocephalus may be associated
with damage to ependymal lining of the ventricles and
periventricular interstitial oedema.
INFECTIONS
A large number of pathogens comprising various kinds of
bacteria, fungi, viruses, rickettsiae and parasites can cause
infections of the nervous system. The micro-organisms may
gain entry into the nervous system by one of the following
routes:
1.
Via blood stream. Spread of infection by the arterial route
from another focus is the most common mode of spread of
infection in the nervous system. Less often, the spread may
occur by retrograde venous route and by lodgement of septic
emboli in the brain.
2.
Direct implantation. Spread of infection by direct
implantation occurs following skull fractures or through
defects in the bony and meningeal coverings of the nervous
system.
3.
Local extension. Extension of infection from contiguous
focus such as otitis media and frontal or mastoid sinusitis
may occur.
4.
Along nerve. Certain viruses such as herpes simplex,
herpes zoster and rabies spread along cranial and peripheral
nerves and ascend to the CNS.
In general, resultant lesions are in the form of either
diffuse inflammation of the meninges (meningitis) and of
brain parenchyma (encephalitis), or combination of both
(meningoencephalitis). In addition, other inflammatory
lesions of CNS include: brain abscess, epidural abscess,
subdural empyema, septic thromboembolism of dural
sinuses and encephalomyelitis. Some of the morphologically
significant lesions are described below.
MENINGITIS
Meningitis is inflammatory involvement of the meninges.
Meningitis may involve the dura called pachymeningitis, or
the leptomeninges (pia-arachnoid) termed leptomeningitis.
The latter is far more common, and unless otherwise
specified, meningitis would mean leptomeningitis.
Pachymeningitis is invariably an extension of the inflam-
mation from chronic suppurative otitis media or from
fracture of the skull. An extradural abscess may form by
suppuration between the bone and dura. Further spread of
infection may penetrate the dura and form a subdural abscess.
Other effects of pachymeningitis are localised or generalised
leptomeningitis and cerebral abscess.
Figure 30.2
Normal circulation of CSF.

875
CHAPTER 30
The Nervous System
Leptomeningitis, commonly called meningitis, is usually
the result of infection but infrequently chemical meningitis
and carcinomatous meningitis by infiltration of the
subarachnoid space by cancer cells may occur. Infectious
meningitis is broadly classified into 3 types: acute pyogenic,
acute lymphocytic (viral, aseptic) and chronic (bacterial or
fungal).
Acute Pyogenic Meningitis
Acute pyogenic or acute purulent meningitis is acute infec-
tion of the pia-arachnoid and of the CSF enclosed in the
subarachnoid space. Since the subarachnoid space is
continuous around the brain, spinal cord and the optic
nerves, infection spreads immediately to whole of the
cerebrospinal meninges as well as to the ventricles.
ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The causative organisms vary with
age of the patient:
1.
Escherichia coli infection is common in neonates with
neural tube defects.
2.
Haemophilus influenzae is commonly responsible for
infection in infants and children.
3.
Neisseria meningitidis causes meningitis in adolescent and
young adults and is causative for epidemic meningitis.
4.
Streptococcus pneumoniae is causative for infection at
extremes of age and following trauma.
The routes of infection in acute pyogenic meningitis are
as follows:
1.
Most commonly by the blood stream.
2.
From an adjacent focus of infection.
3.
By iatrogenic infection such as introduction of micro-
organisms at operation or during lumbar puncture.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, pus accumulates
in the subarachnoid space so that normally clear CSF
becomes turbid or frankly purulent. The turbid fluid is
particularly seen in the sulci and at the base of the brain
where the space is wide. In fulminant cases, some degree
of ventriculitis is also present having a fibrinous coating
on their walls and containing turbid CSF. In addition,
purulent material may interfere with CSF flow and result
in obstructive hydrocephalus.
Microscopically, there is presence of numerous
polymorphonuclear neutrophils in the subarachnoid space
as well as in the meninges, particularly around the blood
vessels (Fig. 30.3). Gram-staining reveals varying number
of causative bacteria.
CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS. Acute bacterial
meningitis is a medical emergency. The immediate clinical
manifestations are fever, severe headache, vomiting,
drowsiness, stupor, coma, and occasionally, convulsions. The
most important clinical sign is stiffness of the neck on forward
bending.
The diagnosis is confirmed by examining CSF as soon as
possible. The diagnostic alterations in the CSF in acute
pyogenic meningitis are as under:
1.
Naked eye appearance of cloudy or frankly purulent CSF.
2.
Elevated CSF pressure (above 180 mm water).
3.
Polymorphonuclear neutrophilic leucocytosis in CSF
(between 10-10,000/μl).
4.
Raised CSF protein level (higher than 50 mg/dl).
5.
Decreased CSF sugar concentration (lower than 40 mg/
dl).
6.
Bacteriologic examination by Gram’s stain or by CSF
culture reveals causative organism.
Acute Lymphocytic (Viral, Aseptic) Meningitis
Acute lymphocytic meningitis is a viral or aseptic menin-
gitis, especially common in children and young adults.
Among the etiologic agents are numerous viruses such as
enteroviruses, mumps, ECHO viruses, coxsackie virus,
Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus-2, arthropode-borne
viruses and HIV. However, evidence of viral infection may
not be demonstrable in about a third of cases.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, some cases show
swelling of the brain while others show no distinctive
change.
Microscopically, there is mild lymphocytic infiltrate in
the leptomeninges.
CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS. The clinical
manifestations of viral meningitis are much the same as in
bacterial meningitis with features of acute onset meningeal
symptoms and fever. However, viral meningitis has a benign
and self-limiting clinical course of short duration and is
invariably followed by complete recovery without the life-
threatening complications of bacterial meningitis.
The CSF findings in viral meningitis are as under:
1.
Naked eye appearance of clear or slightly turbid CSF.
2.
CSF pressure increased (above 250 mm water).
3.
Lymphocytosis in CSF (10-100 cells/μl).

Chronic (Tuberculous and Cryptococcal) Meningitis
There are two principal types of chronic meningitis—one
bacterial (tuberculous meningitis) and the other fungal
(cryptococcal meningitis). Both types cause chronic
granulomatous reaction and may produce parenchymal
lesions.
Tuberculous meningitis occurs in children and adults
through haematogenous spread of infection from tuber-
culosis elsewhere in the body, or it may simply be a mani-
festation of miliary tuberculosis. Less commonly, the spread
may occur directly from tuberculosis of a vertebral body.
Cryptococcal meningitis develops particularly in debilitated
or immunocompromised persons, usually as a result of
haematogenous dissemination from a pulmonary lesion.
Cryptococcal meningitis is especially an important cause of
meningitis in patients with AIDS.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, in tuberculous
meningitis, the subarachnoid space contains thick exudate,
particularly abundant in the sulci and the base of the brain.
Tubercles, 1-2 mm in diameter, may be visible, especially
adjacent to the blood vessels. The exudate in cryptococcal
meningitis is scanty, translucent and gelatinous.
Microscopically, tuberculous meningitis shows exudate
of acute and chronic inflammatory cells, and granulomas
with or without caseation necrosis and giant cells. Acid-
fast bacilli may be demonstrated. Late cases show dense
fibrous adhesions in the subarachnoid space and
consequent hydrocephalus. Cryptococcal meningitis is
characterised by infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells,
an occasional granuloma and abundant characteristic
capsulated cryptococci.
CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS. Tuberculous
meningitis manifests clinically as headache, confusion,
malaise and vomiting. The clinical course in cryptococcal
meningitis may, however, be fulminant and fatal in a few
weeks, or be indolent for months to years.
The CSF findings in chronic meningitis are as under:
1.
Naked eye appearance of a clear or slightly turbid CSF
which may form fibrin web on standing.
2.
Raised CSF pressure (above 300 mm water).
3.
Mononuclear leucocytosis consisting mostly of lympho-
cytes and some macrophages (100-1000 cells/μl).
4.
Raised protein content.
5.
Lowered glucose concentration.
6.
Tubercle bacilli may be found on microscopy of centri-
fuged deposits by ZN staining in tuberculous meningitis.
Pathognomonic capsulated cryptococci with a halo are
appreciated in India ink preparation of CSF in cases of
cryptococcal meningitis, while the capsule is better
demonstrated by mucicarmine stain (Fig. 30.4).
Table 30.1 summarises the CSF findings in the three
important types of meningitis in comparison with those in
health.

CHAPTER 30
The Nervous System
ENCEPHALITIS
Parenchymal infection of brain is termed encephalitis.
Encephalitis may be the result of bacterial, viral, fungal and
protozoal infections.
Bacterial Encephalitis
Bacterial infection of the brain substance is usually secondary
to involvement of the meninges rather than a primary
bacterial parenchymal infection. This results in bacterial
cerebritis that progresses to form brain abscess. However,
tuberculosis and neurosyphilis are the two primary bacterial
involvements of the brain parenchyma.
BRAIN ABSCESS. Brain abscesses may arise by one of the
following routes:
1.
By direct implantation of organisms e.g. following
compound fractures of the skull.
2.
By local extension of infection e.g. chronic suppurative
otitis media, mastoiditis and sinusitis.
3.
By haematogenous spread e.g. from primary infection in
the heart such as acute bacterial endocarditis, and from lungs
such as in bronchiectasis.
Clinically, there is usually evidence of reactivation of
infection at the primary site preceding the onset of cerebral
symptoms. The features of abscess are fever, headache,
vomiting, seizures and focal neurological deficits depending
upon the location of the abscess. Brain abscess is most
common in cerebral hemispheres and less frequent in the
cerebellum and basal ganglia.
Grossly, it appears as a localised area of inflammatory
necrosis and oedema surrounded by fibrous capsule.
Microscopically, the changes consist of liquefactive
necrosis in the centre of the abscess containing pus. It is
surrounded by acute and chronic inflammatory cells,
neovascularisation, oedema, septic thrombosis of vessels,
fibrous encapsulation and zone of gliosis. The CSF and
overlying meninges also show evidence of acute and
chronic inflammation.
TUBERCULOMA. Tuberculoma is an intracranial mass
occurring secondary to dissemination of tuberculosis
elsewhere in the body. Tuberculomas may be solitary or
multiple.
Grossly, it has a central area of caseation necrosis
surrounded by fibrous capsule.
Microscopically, there is typical tuberculous granu-
lomatous reaction around the central caseation necrosis
(Fig. 30.5). A zone of gliosis generally surrounds the
tuberculoma. Advanced cases may show areas of
calcification.
NEUROSYPHILIS. Syphilitic lesions of the CNS used to be
common and serious, but more recently there is evidence of
atypical neurosyphilis in cases of HIV/AIDS. The lesions in
syphilis may be in the form of syphilitic meningitis found in
secondary syphilis, and neurosyphilis consisting of tabes
dorsalis and generalised paralysis of the insane occurring in
tertiary stage (page 161).
Syphilitic meningitis. This is a form of chronic meningitis
characterised by distinctive perivascular inflammatory
reaction of plasma cells and endarteritis obliterans.
Tabes dorsalis (Locomotor ataxia). There is slowly pro-
gressive degeneration of the posterior roots of the spinal
nerves and the posterior columns of the spinal cord by the
spirochaetes. These changes produce loss of coordination of
muscles and joints resulting in locomotor ataxia. These
changes produce loss of coordination of muscles and joints
resulting in locomotor ataxia. There is also loss of pain
sensation and presence of Argyll-Robertson pupils which
react to accommodation but not to light.
General paralysis of the insane. This is the result of diffuse
parenchymal involvement by the spirochaetes with
widespread lesions in the nervous system. The symptoms
consist of motor, sensory and psychiatric abnormalities.
Viral Encephalitis
A number of viruses can infect the CNS and produce either
aseptic meningitis (described already) or viral encephalitis,
but sometimes combination of both termed meningo-
encephalitis, is present. Most viral infections of the CNS are
the end-result of preceding infection in other tissues and
organs. There is usually a preceding phase of extraneural
viral replication before involvement of the nervous system
occurs.
Most of the viruses reach the nervous system via blood
stream before which they enter the body by various routes
e.g. infection of the skin and mucous membrane (in herpes
simplex and herpes zoster-varicella), by the alimentary tract
(in enteroviruses including polio virus), by arthropod bite
(in arbovirus), by transplacental infection (in cytomegalo-
virus), and through body fluids in AIDS (in HIV infection).
Figure 30.5
Tuberculous encephalitis of the brain.

878
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Rabies virus travels along the peripheral nerves to reach the
CNS. Herpes zoster-varicella is a distinct primary disease
(chickenpox) but the virus remains latent for a long time
before it gets reactivated to cause severe hyperalgesia and
pain along the distribution of nerve related to acutely
inflamed posterior root ganglia (herpes zoster). All these viral
infections enumerated so far cause acute viral encephalitis. Slow
virus diseases are another group of CNS infections in which
the agents have not only a long latent period but the disease
also develops slowly and may produce subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis, progressive multifocal leucoence-
phalopathy, progressive rubella panencephalopathy and
subacute spongiform encephalopathy.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Although histologic
changes vary from one viral infection of the CNS to the
other but, in general, the characteristic features of viral
diseases of the CNS are as under:
1.
Parenchymal infiltrate, chiefly in perivascular location,
of mononuclear cells consisting of lymphocytes, plasma
cells and macrophages.
2.
Microscopic clusters of microglial cells and presence
of neuronophagia.
3.
Intranuclear inclusion bodies in most viral diseases
and specific cytoplasmic inclusions of Negri bodies in
rabies.
HIV Encephalopathy (AIDS-Dementia Complex)
Next to knocking off of the immune system, HIV has profound
neurovirulence but unlike tropism for CD4+ T cells of the
immune system, HIV does not have neurotropism. HIV has
not been identified to infect the neuronal cells but instead
infects the cells of monocyte-macrophage cell line including
microglial cells. HIV infection then sets in a cascade of toxic
mediators and cytokines—TNF-α,IL-1, IL-6, TGF-β,
IFN-γ, platelet activating factor (PAF) and endothelin, all of
which cause damage to the neuroglial tissues.
Important forms of CNS diseases in patients with AIDS
are listed in Table 30.2. Late in the course of AIDS, a group
of signs and symptoms of CNS disease appear termed HIV
encephalopathy or AIDS-dementia complex. One major
clinical feature of this entity is the occurrence of dementia i.e.
fall in the cognitive ability of the individual compared to
previous level. The condition is believed to be the result of
direct effect of HIV on the CNS. Clinically, the disease
develops in about 25% cases of AIDS while autopsy studies
reveal presence of HIV-encephalopathy in 80-90% cases of
AIDS.
Histologically, the changes are more in subcortical area
of the brain and consist of gliosis, multinucleate giant cell
encephalitis, and vacuolar myelopathy.
Progressive Multifocal Leucoencephalopathy
Progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML) is a slow
viral infection of the CNS caused by a papovavirus called JC
virus (not to be confused with CJ disease or mad-cow disease;
JC virus here stands for the initials of the patient first
infected). PML develops in immunocompromised individual
like CMV and Toxoplasma encephalitis does, and is, therefore,
an important form of encephalitis due to increasing number
of cases of AIDS.
PML infects oligodendrocytes and causes progressive
demyelination at multifocal areas scattered throughout the
CNS.
Grossly, the lesions consist of focal, irregular gelatinous
areas most prominent at the junction of grey and white
matter. Main areas affected are cerebrum, brainstem,
cerebellum, and sometimes spinal cord.
Microscopically, the features are as under:
Focal areas of demyelination.
Many lipid-laden macrophages in the centre of foci.
Enlarged oligodendroglial nuclei containing purple
viral inclusions at the periphery of the lesion.
Spongiform Encephalopathy
(Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease)
Spongiform encephalopathy, also called Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (CJD) or mad-cow disease, though included under
the group of viral encephalitis but is caused by accumulation
of prion proteins. Prion proteins are a modified form of normal
structural proteins present in the mammalian CNS and are
peculiar in two respects: they lack nucleic acid (DNA or
RNA), and they can be transmitted as an infectious proteina-
ceous particles (Dr Prusiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in
medicine in 1997 for his discovery on prion proteins).
Majority of cases occur sporadically though familial
predisposition with autosomal dominant inheritance has also
been reported in 5-15% cases. Other methods of transmission
are by iatrogenic route (e.g. by tissue transplantation from
an infected individual) and by human consumption of BSE
(bovine spongiform encephalopathy)-infected beef, also
called as mad-cow disease.
Clinically, CJD is characterised by rapidly progressive
dementia with prominent association of myoclonus. CJD is
invariably fatal with mean survival of about 7 months after
diagnosis.

CHAPTER 30
The Nervous System
Grossly, the changes are too rapid to become noticeable
but brain atrophy may be seen in long-standing cases.
Microscopically, the hallmark is spongiform change i.e.
there are small round vacuoles in the neuronal cells. These
changes are predominantly seen in the cortex and other
grey matter areas. Spongiform changes result in neuronal
loss and glial cell proliferation but significantly without
any inflammation or white matter involvement.
Fungal and Protozoal Encephalitis
Mycotic diseases of the CNS usually develop by blood stream
from systemic deep mycoses elsewhere in the body. They
are particularly more common in immunosuppressed
individuals such as in AIDS, patients of lymphomas and
other cancers. Some of the fungi which may disseminate to
the CNS are Candida albicans, Mucor, Aspergillus fumigatus,
Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum and
Blastomyces dermatitidis. These fungal infections may produce
one of the three patterns: fungal chronic meningitis, vasculitis
and encephalitis.
Besides fungal infections, CNS may be involved in
protozoal diseases such as in malaria, toxoplasmosis,
amoebiasis, trypanosomiasis and cysticerosis (Fig. 30.6).
CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES
Cerebrovascular diseases are all those diseases in which one
or more of the blood vessels of the brain are involved in the
pathologic processes. Various pathologic processes commonly
implicated in cerebrovascular diseases are: thrombosis,
embolism, rupture of a vessel, hypoxia, hypertensive
arteriolosclerosis, atherosclerosis, arteritis, trauma, aneurysm
and developmental malformations. These processes can result
in 2 main types of parenchymal diseases of the brain:
A. Ischaemic brain damage:
a) Generalised reduction in blood flow resulting in global
hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy
b) Local vascular obstruction causing infarcts.
B. Intracranial haemorrhage:
a) Haemorrhage in the brain parenchyma (intracerebral
haemorrhage)
b) Haemorrhage in the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid
haemorrhage).
The stroke syndrome is the cardinal feature of cere-
brovascular disease. The term stroke is used for sudden and
dramatic development of focal neurologic deficit, varying
from trivial neurologic disorder to hemiplegia and coma.
Other less common effects of vascular disease include:
transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), vascular headache (e.g. in
migraine, hypertension and arteritis), local pressure of an
aneurysm and increased intracranial pressure (e.g. in
hypertensive encephalopathy and venous thrombosis).
A few important forms are discussed below.
A. ISCHAEMIC BRAIN DAMAGE
Ischaemic necrosis in the brain results from ischaemia caused
by considerable reduction or complete interruption of blood
supply to neural tissue which is insufficient to meet its
metabolic needs. The brain requires sufficient quantities of
oxygen and glucose so as to sustain its aerobic metabolism,
mainly by citric acid (Krebs’) cycle which requires oxygen.
Moreover, neural tissue has limited stores of energy reserves
so that cessation of continuous supply of oxygen and glucose
for more than 3-4 minutes results in permanent damage to
neurons and neuroglial cells.
Deprivation of oxygen (anoxia) to the brain may occur in
4 different ways:
1.
Anoxic anoxia, in which there is low inspired pO2.
2.
Anaemic anoxia, in which the oxygen-carrying haemo-
globin is reduced.
3.
Histotoxic anoxia, in which there is direct toxic injury as
occurs in cyanide poisoning.
4.
Stagnant (ischaemia) anoxia, in which the damage is caused
by cessation of blood with resultant local accumulation of
metabolites and changes in pH.
In all these different forms of anoxia, the end-result is
ischaemic brain damage which may have one of the following
two patterns:
1.
Global hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, resulting from
generalised cerebral hypoperfusion.
2.
Cerebral infarction, resulting from severe localised
reduction or cessation of blood supply.
Global Hypoxic-Ischaemic Encephalopathy
The brain receives 20% of cardiac output for maintaining its
vital aerobic metabolism. A number of factors determine the
maximum length of time the CNS can survive irreversible
ischaemic damage. These are as under:
i)
Severity of the hypoxic episode.
ii) Presence of pre-existing cerebrovascular disease.
iii) Age of the patient.
iv) Body temperature.
In normal individuals, the brain continues to be perfused
adequately up to systolic arterial pressure of 50 mmHg by
an auto-regulatory vascular control mechanism. However,
Figure 30.6
Neurocysticercosis. The sliced surface of the cerebral
hemisphere of the brain shows may tiny whitish nodules and cysts about
1 cm in diameter.

880
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
fall of systemic arterial systolic pressure below this critical
value results in rapid fall in cerebral perfusion pressure and
eventual ischaemic encephalopathy. Such types of medical
emergencies occur at the time of cardiac arrest followed by
relatively delayed resuscitation, severe episode of hypo-
tension, carbon monoxide intoxication and status epilepticus.
Hypoxic encephalopathy may be followed by a post-
ischaemic confusional state and complete recovery or a state
of coma and even a persistent vegetative life and brain death.
Depending upon the proneness of different cells of the
brain to the effects of ischaemia-hypoxia, three types of lesion
may occur:
1. Selective neuronal damage: Neurons are most vulnerable
to damaging effect of ischaemia-hypoxia and irreversible
injury. In particular, oligodendroglial cells are most
susceptible, followed by astrocytes while microglial cells and
vascular endothelium survive the longest. The reason for
undue vulnerability of neurons to hypoxia can be explained
by various factors:
i)
Different cerebral circulatory blood flow.
ii) Presence of acidic excitatory neurotransmitters called
excitotoxins.
iii) Excessive metabolic requirement of these neurons.
iv) Increased sensitivity of neurons to lactic acid.
2. Laminar necrosis: Global ischaemia of cerebral cortex
results in uneven damage because of different cerebral
vasculature which is termed laminar or pseudolaminar
necrosis. In this, superficial areas of cortical layers escape
damage while deeper layers are necrosed.
3. Watershed infarcts: Circulatory flow in the brain by
anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries has
overlapping circulations. In ischaemia-hypoxia, perfusion of
overlapping zones, being farthest from the blood supply,
suffers maximum damage. This results in wedge-shaped
areas of coagulative necrosis called watershed or borderzone
infarcts. Particularly vulnerable is the border zone of the
cerebral cortex between the anterior and middle cerebral
arteries, producing para-sagittal infarction.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The pathologic appear-
ance of the brain in hypoxic encephalopathy varies
depending upon the duration and severity of hypoxic
episode and the length of survival.
Survival for a few hours: No pathologic changes are
visible.
Survival 12-24 hours: No macroscopic change is
discernible but microscopic examination reveals early
neuronal damage in the form of eosinophilic cytoplasm
and pyknotic nuclei, so called red neurons.
After 2-7 days: Grossly, there is focal softening. The
area supplied by distal branches of the cerebral arteries
suffers from the most severe ischaemic damage and may
develop border zone or watershed infarcts in the junctional
zones between the territories supplied by major arteries.
Microscopically, the nerve cells die and disappear and
are replaced by reactive fibrillary gliosis. There are minor
variations in the distribution of neuronal damage to the
cortex; the loss of pyramidal cell layer is more severe than
that of granular cell layer producing laminar necrosis.
Longer duration: Use of modern ventilators has led
to maintenance of cardiorespiratory function in the
presence of total brain necrosis unassociated with vital
reaction.
Cerebral Infarction
Cerebral infarction is a localised area of tissue necrosis caused
by local vascular occlusion—arterial or venous. Occasionally,
it may be the result of non-occlusive causes such as
compression on the cerebral arteries from outside and from
hypoxic encephalopathy. Clinically, the signs and symptoms
associated with cerebral infarction depend upon the region
infarcted. In general, the focal neurologic deficit termed
stroke, is present. However, significant atherosclerotic
cerebrovascular disease may produce transient ischaemic
attacks (TIA).
1.
Arterial occlusion. Occlusion of the cerebral arteries by
either thrombi or emboli is the most common cause of
cerebral infarction. Thrombotic occlusion of the cerebral
arteries is most frequently the result of atherosclerosis, and
rarely, from arteritis of the cranial arteries. Embolic arterial
occlusion is commonly derived from the heart, most often
from mural thrombosis complicating myocardial infarction,
from atrial fibrillation and endocarditis. The size and shape
of an infarct are determined by the extent of anastomotic
connections with adjacent arterial branches as under:
Circle of Willis provides a complete collateral flow for
internal carotid and vertebral arteries.
Middle and anterior cerebral arteries have partial
anastomosis of their distal branches. Their complete
occlusion may cause infarcts.
Small terminal cerebral arteries, on the contrary, are end-
arteries and have no anastomosis. Hence, occlusion of these
branches will invariably lead to an infarct.
2.
Venous occlusion. Venous infarction in the brain is an
infrequent phenomenon due to good communications of the
cerebral venous drainage. However in cancer, due to
increased predisposition to thrombosis, superior sagittal
thrombosis may occur leading to bilateral, parasagittal,
multiple haemorrhagic infarcts.
3.
Non-occlusive causes. Compression of the cerebral arte-
ries from outside such as occurs during herniation may cause
cerebral infarction. Mechanism of watershed (border zone)
cerebral infarction in hypoxic encephalopathy has already
been explained above.
In any case, the extent of damage produced by any of the
above causes depends upon:
i)
rate of reduction of blood flow;
ii) type of blood vessel involved; and
iii) extent of collateral circulation.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, cerebral infarcts
may be anaemic or haemorrhagic. An anaemic infarct

881
CHAPTER 30
The Nervous System
becomes evident 6-12 hours after its occurrence. The
affected area is soft and swollen and there is blurring of
junction between grey and white matter. Within 2-3 days,
the infarct undergoes softening and disintegration.
Eventually, there is central liquefaction with peripheral
firm glial reaction and thickened leptomeninges, forming
a cystic infarct (Fig. 30.7). A haemorrhagic infarct is red and
superficially resembles a haematoma. It is usually the
result of fragmentation of occlusive arterial emboli or
venous thrombosis.
Histologically, the sequential changes are as under:
1.
Initially, there is eosinophilic neuronal necrosis and
lipid vacuolisation produced by breakdown of myelin.
Simultaneously, the infarcted area is infiltrated by
neutrophils.
2.
After the first 2-3 days, there is progressive invasion
by macrophages and there is astrocytic and vascular
proliferation.
3.
In the following weeks to months, the macrophages
clear away the necrotic debris by phagocytosis followed
by reactive astrocytosis, often with little fine fibrosis
(Fig. 30.8). A haemorrhagic infarct has some phagocytes
containing haemosiderin.
4.
Ultimately, after 3-4 months an old cystic infarct is
formed which shows a cyst traversed by small blood
vessels and has peripheral fibrillary gliosis. Small cavi-
tary infarcts are called lacunar infarcts and are commonly
found as a complication of systemic hypertension.
B. INTRACRANIAL HAEMORRHAGE
Haemorrhage into the brain may be traumatic, non-trau-
matic, or spontaneous. There are two main types of
spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage:
1.
Intracerebral haemorrhage, which is usually of hyper-
tensive origin.
2.
Subarachnoid haemorrhage, which is commonly aneu-
rysmal in origin.
In addition to hypertension and rupture of an aneurysm,
other causes of spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage
include vascular malformations which produce mixed
intracerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhage, haemorrhagic
diathesis and haemorrhage into tumours.
Intracerebral Haemorrhage
Spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage occurs mostly in
patients of hypertension. Most hypertensives over middle
age have microaneurysms in very small cerebral arteries in
the brain tissue. Rupture of one of the numerous
microaneurysms is believed to be the cause of intracerebral
haemorrhage. Unlike subarachnoid haemorrhage, it is not
common to have recurrent intracerebral haemorrhages.
The common sites of hypertensive intracerebral haemor-
rhage are the region of the basal ganglia (particularly the
putamen and the internal capsule), pons and the cerebellar
cortex. Clinically the onset is usually sudden with headache
and loss of consciousness. Depending upon the location of
the lesion, hemispheric, brainstem or cerebellar signs will
be present. About 40% of patients die during the first 3-4
days of haemorrhage, mostly from haemorrhage into the
ventricles. The survivors tend to have haematoma that
separates the tissue planes which is followed by resolution
and development of an apoplectic cyst accompanied by loss
of function.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly and micros-
copically, the haemorrhage consists of dark mass of
clotted blood replacing brain parenchyma. The borders
of the lesion are sharply-defined and have a narrow rim
of partially necrotic parenchyma. Small ring haemor-
rhages in the Virchow-Robin space in the border zone are
commonly present. Ipsilateral ventricles are distorted and
compressed and may contain blood in their lumina.
Rarely, blood may rupture through the surface of the brain
into the subarachnoid space. After a few weeks to months,
the haematoma undergoes resolution with formation of a

Systemic Pathology
slit-like space called apoplectic cyst which contains
yellowish fluid. Its margins are yellow-brown and have
haemosiderin-laden macrophages and a reactive zone of
fibrillary astrocytosis.
Subarachnoid Haemorrhage
Haemorrhage into the subarachnoid space is most comm-
only caused by rupture of an aneurysm, and rarely, rupture
of a vascular malformation.
A general discussion of aneurysms is given on page 405.
Of the three types of aneurysms affecting the larger
intracranial arteries—berry, mycotic and fusiform, berry
aneurysms are most important and most common.
BERRY ANEURYSMS are saccular in appearance with
rounded or lobulated bulge arising at the bifurcation of
intracranial arteries and varying in size from 2 mm to 2 cm
or more. They account for 95% of aneurysms which are liable
to rupture. Berry aneurysms are rare in childhood but
increase in frequency in young adults and middle life. They
are, therefore, not congenital anomalies but develop over the
years from developmental defect of the media of the arterial
wall at the bifurcation of arteries forming thin-walled saccu-
lar bulges. Although most berry aneurysms are sporadic in
occurrence, there is an increased incidence of their presence
in association with congenital polycystic kidney disease and
coarctation of the aorta. About a quarter of berry aneurysms
are multiple.
In more than 85% cases of subarachnoid haemorrhage,
the cause is massive and sudden bleeding from a berry
aneurysm on or near the circle of Willis. The four most
common sites are as under (Fig. 30.9):
1.
In relation to anterior communicating artery.
2.
At the origin of the posterior communicating artery from

and anterior cerebral arteries.
The remaining 15% cases of subarachnoid haemorrhage
are the result of rupture in the posterior circulation, vascular
malformations and rupture of mycotic aneurysms that occurs
in the setting of bacterial endocarditis. In all types of
aneurysms, the rupture of thin-walled dilatation occurs in
association with sudden rise in intravascular pressure but
chronic hypertension does not appear to be a risk factor in
their development or rupture.
Clinically, berry aneurysms remain asymptomatic prior
to rupture. On rupture, they produce severe generalised
headache of sudden onset which is frequently followed by
unconsciousness and neurologic defects. Initial mortality
from first rupture is about 20-25%. Survivors recover
completely but frequently suffer from recurrent episodes of
fresh bleeding.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Rupture of a berry aneu-
rysm frequently spreads haemorrhage throughout the
subarachnoid space with rise in intracranial pressure and
characteristic blood-stained CSF. An intracerebral
haematoma may develop if the blood tracks into the brain
parenchyma. The region of the brain supplied by the
affected artery frequently shows infarction, partly
attributed to vasospasm.
TRAUMA TO THE CNS
Trauma to the CNS constitutes an important cause of death
and permanent disability in the modern world. Important
causes of head injuries are: motor vehicle accidents,
accidental falls and violence. Traumatic injuries to the CNS
may result in three consequences which may occur in
isolation or in combination:
epidural haematoma;
subdural haematoma; and
parenchymal brain damage.
A. Epidural Haematoma
Epidural haematoma is accumulation of blood between the
dura and the skull following fracture of the skull, most
commonly from rupture of middle meningeal artery. The
haematoma expands rapidly since accumulating blood is
arterial in origin and causes compression of the dura and
flattening of underlying gyri (Fig. 30.10). The patient
develops progressive loss of consciousness if haematoma is
not drained early.
B. Subdural Haematoma
Subdural haematoma is accumulation of blood between the
dura and subarachnoid and develops most often from
rupture of veins which cross the surface convexities of the
cerebral hemispheres. Subdural haematoma may be acute
or chronic.
Acute subdural haematoma. Acute subdural haematoma
develops following trauma and consists of clotted blood,
often in the frontoparietal region. There is no significant
compression of gyri (Fig. 30.11). Since the accumulated blood
is of venous origin, symptoms appear slowly and may
become chronic with passage of time if not fatal.

(saccular) aneurysms. The serial numbers indicate the frequency of

CHAPTER 30
The Nervous System
Chronic subdural haematoma. Chronic subdural haema-
toma occurs often with brain atrophy and less commonly
following trauma. Chronic subdural haematoma is composed
of liquid blood. Separating the haematoma from underlying
brain is a membrane composed of granulation tissue.
C. Parenchymal Brain Damage
Trauma to the CNS may result in damage to brain paren-
chyma and includes the following forms:
1.
Concussion. Concussion is caused by closed head injury
and is characterised by transient neurologic dysfunction and
loss of consciousness. Invariably, there is complete neurologic
recovery after some hours to days.
No significant morphologic change is noticed but more
severe concussion may cause diffuse axonal injury
(discussed below).
2.
Diffuse axonal injury. Diffuse axonal injury is the most
common cause of persistent coma or vegetative state
following head injury. The underlying cause is sudden
angular acceleration or deceleration resulting in widespread
axonal shearing in the deep white matter of both the
hemispheres.
Grossly, the changes are minimal to small multiple
haemorrhages.
3.
Contusions and lacerations. Contusions and lacerations
are the result of direct damage to the brain parenchyma,
particularly cerebral hemispheres, as occurs in the soft
tissues. Most often, they are the result of blunt trauma. The
overlying skull may or may not be fractured. Traumatic
subarachnoid haemorrhage invariably accompanies cerebral
contusions.
Microscopically, brain parenchyma at the affected site is
haemorrhagic, necrotic and fragmented. On healing, these
lesions appear as shrunken areas with golden brown
haemosiderin pigment on the surface.
4.
Traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage. On trauma to the
CNS, the parenchymal vessels of the hemispheres may get
torn and cause multiple intracerebral haemorrhages.
5.
Brain swelling. Head injury may be accompanied by
localised or diffuse brain swelling.
DEMYELINATING DISEASES
Demyelinating diseases are an important group of
neurological disorders which have, in common, the
pathologic features of focal or patchy destruction of myelin
sheaths in the CNS accompanied by an inflammatory
response. Demyelination may affect peripheral nervous
system as well. Some degree of axonal damage may also
occur but demyelination is the predominant feature. The
exact cause for demyelination is not known but currently
viral infection and autoimmunity are implicated in its
pathogenesis.
Loss of myelin may occur in certain other conditions as
well, but without an inflammatory response. These
conditions have known etiologies such as: genetically-
determined defects in the myelin metabolism (leucodys-
trophies), slow virus diseases of oligodendrocytes (pro-
gressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy), and exposure to
toxins (central pontine myelinolysis). All these entities are
currently not classified as demyelinating diseases. Only those
conditions in which the myelin sheath or the myelin-forming
cells (i.e. oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells) are primarily
injured and are associated with considerable inflammatory
exudate are included under the term ‘demyelinating
diseases’. Pathologically and clinically, two demyelinating
diseases are distinguished:
1.
Multiple or disseminated sclerosis
2.
Perivenous encephalomyelitis.
Multiple (Disseminated) Sclerosis
Multiple or disseminated sclerosis is the most common of
the CNS demyelinating diseases. The usual age at onset is
20 to 40 years. The disease presents as recurrent attacks of
focal neurologic disorder with predilection for involvement
Figure 30.10
Epidural haematoma often results from rupture of
artery following skull fracture resulting in accumulation of arterial blood
between the skull and the dura.
Figure 30.11
Subdural haematoma often results from rupture of
veins crossing the cerebral convexities and is characterised by
accumulation of venous blood between the dura and the arachnoid.

884
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
of the spinal cord, optic nerve and brain. The first attack
usually begins with a single sign or symptom, most
commonly optic neuritis, followed by recovery. As the
disease becomes more progressive, remissions become
infrequent and incomplete. The etiology of multiple sclerosis
remains unknown but a role for genetic susceptibility,
infectious agent and immunologic mechanism has been
proposed.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The pathologic hallmark
is the presence of many scattered discrete areas of
demyelination termed plaques.
Grossly, plaques appear as grey-pink, swollen, sharply
defined, usually bilaterally symmetric areas in the white
matter.
Microscopically, the features vary according to the age
of the plaque:
1.
ln active enlarging plaques, the histologic features are
accumulation of lymphocytes and macrophages around
venules and at the plaque margin where demyelination
is occurring. In addition, there is loss of oligodendrocytes
and presence of reactive astrocytosis with numerous lipid-
laden macrophages (microglia) in the plaque. The axons
in the plaque are generally intact.
2.
In old inactive plaques, there is no perivascular inflam-
matory cell infiltrate and nearly total absence of
oligodendrocytes. Demyelination in the plaque area is
complete as there is only limited regeneration of myelin.
Gliosis is well-developed but astrocytes are less
prominent. Some axonal loss may be present.
Perivenous Encephalomyelitis
Perivenous encephalomyelitis includes two uncommon
diseases: acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and acute
necrotising haemorrhagic leucoencephalitis. Both are monophasic
diseases characterised by perivenous mononuclear
inflammatory cell infiltration. Both diseases occur following
a viral infection, vaccination or a respiratory illness. Both
these conditions are looked upon as human counterpart of
experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and are
considered to be allergic reaction against myelin antigen.
Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis occurs usually
following viral infection (measles, mumps, rubella,
chickenpox), whooping cough or vaccination. The disease
begins abruptly with headache and delirium followed by
lethargy and coma. Signs of meningeal irritation and fever
may be present. Prognosis for recovery is generally good.
Acute necrotising haemorrhagic leucoencephalitis is a
rare disease occurring more often after a respiratory infection.
The clinical course is similar to that of acute disseminated
encephalomyelitis except for its suddenness of onset and
rapidity of progression, sometimes leading to death within
48 hours.
MISCELLANEOUS DISEASES
Included under the heading of miscellaneous diseases of the
CNS are degenerative, metabolic and nutritional diseases.
These groups along with the list of diseases included in each
group are briefly outlined below without going into the
details of individual diseases for which the interested reader
may consult pertinent text on neuropathology and neurology.
Degenerative Diseases
Degenerative diseases are disorders of unknown etiology
and pathogenesis, characterised pathologically by prog-
ressive loss of CNS neurons and their processes accom-
panied by fibrillary astrocytosis. The identification of these
diseases depends upon exclusion of diseases with known
etiologies such as metabolic disturbances, vascular
diseases, nutritional deficiencies or infection. A consider-
able proportion of degenerative disorders are genetic in
origin, with either dominant or recessive inheritance;
others occur sporadically. Family history is, of course, of
great importance.
The degenerative disorders usually begin insidiously and
have a gradual progressive course over many years. In
virtually all cases, the lesions have characteristic bilaterally
symmetric distribution. Another striking characteristic of the
degenerative disorders is that particular anatomic or
physiologic system of neurons may be selectively affected,
leaving others entirely intact.
Classification of degenerative diseases into individual
syndromes is based on clinical aspects and anatomic
distribution of the lesions. Some of the more common
degenerative diseases are listed in Table 30.3. Two of the
important examples—Alzheimer’s disease and parkin-
sonism, are considered below.
ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE. Alzheimer’s disease is the most
common cause of dementia in the elderly. The condition
occurs after 5th decade of life and its incidence progressively
increases with advancing age. The exact cause is not known
but a few factors are implicated in its etiology which include
positive family history and deposition of Aβ amyloid derived
from amyloid precursor protein (APP) forming neuritic ‘senile’
plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.
Grossly, the brain is often reduced in weight and
bilaterally atrophic.
Microscopically, the main features are as under:
i)
Senile neuritic plaque is the most conspicuous lesion and
consists of focal area which has a central core containing
Aβ amyloid.
ii) Neurofibrillary tangle is a filamentous collection of
neurofilaments and neurotubules within the cytoplasm
of neurons.
iii) Amyloid angiopathy is deposition of the same amyloid
in the vessel wall which is deposited in the amyloid core
of the plaque.
iv) Granulovacuolar degeneration is presence of multiple,
small intraneuronal cytoplasmic vacuoles, some of which
contain one or more dark granules called Hirano bodies.
PARKINSONISM. Parkinsonism is a syndrome of chronic
progressive disorder of motor function and is clinically
characterised by tremors which are most conspicuous at rest
and worsen with emotional stress; other features are rigidity

885
CHAPTER 30
The Nervous System
and disordered gait and posture. Parkinsonism is caused by
several degenerative diseases, the most important being
Parkinson’s disease; other causes of parkinsonism are
trauma, toxic agents, and drugs (dopamine antagonists).
Grossly, the brain is atrophic or may be normal externally.
Microscopically, the hallmark is depigmentation of
substantia nigra and locus ceruleus due to loss of
neuromelanin pigment from neurons and accumulation
of neuromelanin pigment in the glial cells. Some of the
residual neurons in these areas contain intracytoplasmic,
eosinophilic, elongated inclusions called Lewy bodies.
Metabolic Diseases
Metabolic diseases of the CNS result from neurochemical
disturbances which are either inherited or acquired.
Hereditary metabolic disorders predominantly manifest in
infancy or childhood and include genetically-determined
disorders of carbohydrate, lipid, amino acid and mineral
metabolism. Acquired or secondary metabolic diseases are the
disturbances of cerebral function due to disease in some other
organ system such as the heart and circulation, lungs and
respiratory function, kidneys, liver, endocrine glands and
pancreas. In addition, endogenous metabolic diseases may
be caused by toxic injuries induced by metals, gases,
chemicals, and drugs. The pathologic changes in each of these
conditions are quite diverse and include oedema, neuronal
storage, degenerative changes, and sometimes parenchymal
necrosis.
The predominant types of hereditary and acquired
metabolic disorders are as under:
A. HEREDITARY METABOLIC DISEASES:
1. Neuronal storage diseases—characterised by storage of
a metabolic product in the neurons due to specific enzyme
deficiency. Common examples are: gangliosidoses (e.g.
Tay-Sachs disease or GM2 gangliosidosis), mucopoly-
saccharidoses, Gaucher’s disease and Niemann-Pick
disease). These conditions are described on page 262.
2.
Leucodystrophies—are diseases of white matter charac-
terised by diffuse demyelination and gliosis. They are caused
by deficiency of one of the enzymes required for formation
and maintenance of myelin. That is why these conditions
are also called dysmyelinating diseases. Common types of
leucodystrophies are: sudanophilic leucodystrophy,
adrenoleucodystrophy, metachromatic leucodystrophy and
globoid cell leucodystrophy (Krabbe’s disease).
3.
Other inborn errors of metabolism—e.g. Wilson’s
disease (hepatolenticular degeneration), glycogen-storage
diseases, phenylketonuria and galactosaemia.
B. ACQUIRED METABOLIC DISEASES:
These include the following:
1.
Anoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy
2.
Hypoglycaemic encephalopathy
3.
Hyperglycaemic coma
4.
Acute hepatic encephalopathy (Reye’s syndrome)
5.
Chronic hepatic encephalopathy
6.
Kernicterus
7.
Uraemic encephalopathy
8.
Encephalopathy due to electrolyte and endocrine
disturbances.
All these conditions have already been discussed in the
relevant chapters.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Nutritional Diseases
Neurologic disorders may be caused by malnutrition from
lack of adequate diet in many developing countries and many
poor socio-economic groups. In the United States and Europe,
however, nutritionally-induced disease is chiefly found in
association with chronic alcoholism or due to defect in
absorption, transport or metabolism of dietary nutrients.
The general aspects of deficiency diseases have been
covered in Chapter 9. Some of the common neurologic
diseases included in the category of deficiency diseases are
as under:
1.
Wernicke’s encephalopathy and Korsakoff’s psychosis
(vitamin B1 or thiamine deficiency).
2.
Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord
(vitamin B12 deficiency).

TUMOURS OF THE CNS
Tumours of the CNS may originate in the brain or spinal
cord (primary tumours), or may spread to the brain from
another primary site of cancer (metastatic tumours). More
than one-quarter of the CNS tumours are secondary meta-
stases arising in patients undergoing treatment for systemic
cancer. Primary CNS tumours are the second commonest
form of cancer in infants and children under the age of 15
years, exceeded in frequency only by leukaemia. Both benign
and malignant CNS tumours are capable of producing
neurologic impairment depending upon their site.
Primary CNS tumours or intracranial tumours include:
tumours arising from constituent cells of the brain (with the
sole exception of microglial cells) and from the supporting
tissues. Childhood brain tumours arise from more primitive
cells (e.g. neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma).
A classification of intracranial tumours abbreviated from
the WHO classification is given in Table 30.4. The anatomic
distribution of common intracranial tumours is illustrated
in Fig. 30.12. Among the primary brain tumours, gliomas
constitute 50-60%, meningiomas 25%, schwannomas 10%
and other primary tumours comprise the remainder.
Some of the important morphologic types are described
below.
GLIOMAS
The term glioma is used for all tumours arising from
neuroglia, or more precisely, from neuroectodermal epithelial
tissue. Gliomas are the most common of the primary CNS
tumours and collectively account for 40% of all intracranial
tumours. They include tumours arising:
from astrocytes (astrocytomas and glioblastoma
multiforme);
from oligodendrocytes (oligodendroglioma);
from ependyma (ependymoma); and
from choroid plexus (choroid plexus papilloma).
Gliomas may be well-differentiated or poorly-differen-
tiated. However, gliomas are never truly well-demarcated
or encapsulated and thus all grades of gliomas infiltrate the
adjacent brain tissue.  Gliomas are disseminated to other
parts of the CNS by CSF but they rarely ever metastasise
beyond the CNS.

CHAPTER 30
The Nervous System
Astrocytomas (including Glioblastoma Multiforme)
Astrocytomas are the most common type of gliomas. In
general, they are found in the late middle life with a peak in
6th decade of life. They occur predominantly in the cerebral
hemispheres, and occasionally in the spinal cord. In children
and young adults, pilocytic astrocytomas arise in the optic
nerves, cerebellum and brainstem. Astrocytomas have
tendency to progress from low grade to higher grades of
anaplasia. Low-grade astrocytomas evolve slowly over
several years whereas higher grades (anaplastic astrocytoma
and glioblastoma multiforme) bring about rapid clinical
deterioration of the patient.
The diagnosis of various types of astrocytomas can be
generally made by routine H & E morphology but in difficult
situations and poorly differentiated cases, immunohisto-
chemical staining with glial fibrillary protein (GFAP) or by
electron microscopic demonstration of glial filaments can be
done.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Pathologically, astrocyto-
mas have been conventionally divided into 3 progressive
histologic grades: fibrillary (most common), gemistocytic
and protoplasmic. However, currently WHO classification
of astrocytomas is widely used which divides them into 4
grades from grade I (low grade)  to grade IV (glioblastoma
multiforme) as under.
WHO GRADE I ASTROCYTOMA. Also called as diffuse
astrocytoma, it is a low-grade tumour having good
prognosis and includes special histologic entities which
mainly occur in children as under:
i) Juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma. It occur in children and
young adults in the cerebellum, third ventricle and optic
nerve pathway.
Grossly, it is usually cystic or solid and circumscribed.
Microscopically, it is predominantly composed of
fusiform pilocytic astrocytes having unusually long, wavy
fibrillary processes.
ii) Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. It looks histologically
pleomrphic and alarming but has favourable prognosis.
WHO GRADE II (WELL-DIFFERENTIATED) ASTRO-
CYTOMA. It is also called as fibrillary astrocytoma and
is the most common form of glioma occurring in 3rd to
4th decades of life.
Grossly, it is a poorly defined, grey-white tumour of
variable size. The tumour distorts the underlying brain
tissue and merges with the surrounding tissue.
Histologically, it is composed of well-differentiated
astrocytes separated by variable amount of fibrillary
background of astrocytic processes. Based on the type of
astrocytes, three subtypes are distinguished: fibrillary,
protoplastic and gemistocytic astrocytoma.
WHO GRADE III (ANAPLASTIC) ASTROCYTOMA.
It generally evolves from lower grade of astrocytoma.
Grossly, it may not be distinguishable from the low-grade
astrocytoma.
Histologically, it contains features of anaplasia such as
hypercellularity, pleomorphism, nuclear hyper-
chromatism and mitoses. Another characteristic feature
of anaplastic variety of astrocytoma is the proliferation of
vascular endothelium (Fig. 30.13).
WHO GRADE IV ASTROCYTOMA (GLIOBLAS-
TOMA MULTIFORME). Although its nomenclature
means its origin from embryonal cells but now it is
known that this tumour arises by neoplastic transfor-
mation of mature astrocytes. It is the most aggressive of
astrocytomas.
Grossly, it shows variegated appearance, with some areas
showing grey-white appearance while others are yellow
and soft with foci of haemorrhages and necrosis. The
surrounding normal brain tissue is distorted and
infiltrated by yellow tumour tissue.
Figure 30.13

background. Areas of necrosis are also present.

888
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Histologically, the features are as under (Fig. 30.14):
i)
It has highly anaplastic and cellular appearance. The
cell types show marked variation consisting of fusiform
cells, small poorly-differentiated round cells, pleomorphic
cells and giant cells. Mitoses are quite frequent and glial
fibrils are scanty.
ii) It shows areas of tumour necrosis around which
tumour cells may form pseudopalisading.
iii) Microvascular endothelial proliferation is marked.
Oligodendroglioma
Oligodendroglioma is an uncommon glioma of oligo-
dendroglial origin and may develop in isolation or may be
mixed with other glial cells. The tumour commonly presents
in 3rd to 4th decades of life. It occurs in the cerebral
hemispheres, most commonly in the frontal lobes or within
the ventricles. X-ray examination and CT scan reveal a well-
defined mass with numerous small foci of calcification. The
tumour is generally slow-growing.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, oligodendro-
glioma is well-circumscribed, grey-white and gelatinous
mass having cystic areas, foci of haemorrhages and
calcification.
Microscopically, the tumour is characterised by uniform
cells with round to oval nuclei surrounded by a clear halo
of cytoplasm and well-defined cell membranes.  Tumour
cells tend  to cluster around the native neurons forming
satellitosis. Typically, there are varying degree of endo-
thelial cell hyperplasia and foci of calcification. Anaplastic
change may occur as in other gliomas.
Ependymoma
Ependymoma is not an uncommon tumour, derived from
the layer of epithelium that lines the ventricles and the central
canal of the spinal cord. It occurs chiefly in children and
young adults (below 20 years of age). Typically, it is
encountered in the fourth ventricle (posterior fossa tumour).
Other locations are the lateral ventricles, the third ventricle,
and in the case of adults, the spinal cord in the region of
lumbar spine. Clinically, by virtue of their frequent location
in the floor of the fourth ventricle, ependymomas are asso-
ciated with obstructive hydrocephalus. The usual biologic
behaviour is of a slow-growing tumour over a period of years.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, ependymoma is
a well-demarcated tumour but complete surgical removal
may not be possible due to close proximity to vital
structures in the medulla and pons.
Microscopically, the tumour is composed of uniform
epithelial (ependymal) cells forming rosettes, canals and
perivascular pseudorosettes. By light microscopy under
high magnification, PTAH-positive structures, blepharo-
plasts, representing basal bodies of cilia may be
demonstrated in the cytoplasm of tumour cells (Fig. 30.15).
Figure 30.14
Glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV astrocytoma).
The tumour is densely cellular having marked pleomorphism.
Characteristically, the tumour has areas of necrosis which are surrounded
by a palisade layer of tumour cells.

889
CHAPTER 30
The Nervous System
Most tumours are well-differentiated but anaplastic
variants are also recognised.
Two variants of ependymoma deserve special
mention: myxopapillary type and subependymoma.
Myxopapillary ependymoma. It is a special variant of
ependymoma which is common and occurs in adults.
Characteristically, it occurs in the region of cauda equina
and originates from the filum terminale. True to its name,
it contains myxoid and papillary structures interspersed
in the typical ependymal cells. It is a slow-growing tumour
having a better prognosis.
Subependymoma. It occurs as a small, asymptomatic,
incidental solid nodule in the fourth and lateral ventricle
of middle-aged or elderly patients. Areas of microcysts
and calcification may be encountered.
Histologically, it is composed of nests of uniform
ependymal cells in a stroma of very dense, acellular, finely
fibrillar background. Subependymoma is typically a very
slow-growing tumour.
Choroid Plexus Papilloma
Tumours derived from choroid plexus epithelium are
uncommon intracranial tumours. They are found in the
distribution of the choroid plexus. In children, they occur
most frequently in the lateral ventricles, whereas in adults
fourth ventricle is the most common site. They are invariably
benign tumours and rarely ever undergo malignant
transformation.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour
projects as rounded, papillary mass into one of the
ventricles.
Histologically, choroid plexus papilloma is a papillary
tumour resembling normal choroid plexus with a vascular
connective tissue core covered by a single layer of cuboidal
epithelium which lies upon a basement membrane.
POORLY-DIFFERENTIATED AND
EMBRYONAL TUMOURS
CNS tumours composed of primitive undifferentiated cells
include medulloblastoma and glioblastoma, and rarely,
neuroblastoma (page 800) and retinoblastoma (page 512).
Except for medulloblastoma, other examples of these
tumours have been described elsewhere in the text.
Medulloblastoma
Medulloblastoma is the most common variety of primitive
neuroectodermal tumour. It comprises 25% of all childhood
brain tumours but a quarter of cases occur in patients over
the age of 20 years. The most common location is the
cerebellum in the region of roof of fourth ventricle, in the
midline of cerebellum, in the vermis, and in the cerebellar
hemispheres. Medulloblastoma is a highly malignant tumour
and spreads to local as well as to distant sites. It invades
locally and by the CSF to meninges, ventricles and
subarachnoid space and has a tendency for widespread
metastases to extraneural sites such as to lungs, liver,
vertebrae and pelvis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour typi-
cally protrudes into the fourth ventricle as a soft, grey-
white mass or invades the surface of the cerebellum.
Microscopically, medulloblastoma is composed of small,
poorly-differentiated cells with ill-defined cytoplasmic
processes and a tendency to be arranged around blood
vessels and occasionally forms pseudorosettes (Homer-
Wright rosettes). Another characteristic of the tumour is
differentiation into glial or neuronal elements.
OTHER PRIMARY INTRAPARENCHYMAL TUMOURS
Important examples of some other primary  intraparen-
chymal are haemangioblastoma, CNS lymphoma and germ
cell tumours.
Haemangioblastoma
Haemangioblastoma is a tumour of uncertain origin and
constitutes about 2% of all intracranial tumours. It is seen
more commonly in young adults and is commoner in males.
It may occur sporadically or be a part of von Hippel-Lindau
syndrome (along with cysts in the liver, kidney, and benign/
malignant renal tumour). About a quarter of haemangio-
blastomas secrete erythropoietin and cause polycythaemia.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
usually a circumscribed cystic mass with a mural nodule.
The cyst contains haemorrhagic fluid.
Microscopically, the features are as under:
i) Large number of thin-walled blood vessels lined by
plump endothelium.
ii) Vascular spaces are separated by groups of polygonal
lipid-laden foamy stromal cells.
Primary CNS Lymphoma
Lymphomas in the brain may occur as a part of disseminated
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (Chapter 14) or may be a primary
CNS lymphoma. The incidence of the primary CNS
lymphoma has shown a rising  trend in patients of AIDS
and other immunosuppressed conditions. They occur in men
above 5th decade of life. Primary CNS lymphoma has a poor
prognosis.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is
frequently periventricular in location and may appear
nodular or diffuse.
Microscopically, the features are as under:
i) Characteristically, the tumour grows around blood
vessels i.e. has an angiocentric growth pattern. Reticulin
stain highlights this feature well.
ii) Typically, CNS lymphomas are diffuse, large cell type
with high mitotic activity.
iii) They are generally β-cell type.

SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
Germ Cell Tumours
Rarely, germ cell tumours may occur in the brain, especially
in children. Common locations are suprasellar region and
pineal area. Some common examples of such tumours are
germinoma (seminoma/dysgerminoma), teratoma and
embryonal carcinoma. Morphologically, they are similar to
their counterparts elsewhere.
TUMOURS OF MENINGES
The most common tumour arising from the pia-arachnoid is
meningioma accounting for 20% of intracranial tumours.
Meningioma
Meningiomas arise from the cap cell layer of the arachnoid.
Their most common sites are in the front half of the head
and include: lateral cerebral convexities, midline along the
falx cerebri adjacent to the major venous sinuses
parasagittally, and olfactory groove. Less frequent sites are:
within the cerebral ventricles, foramen magnum, cerebello-
pontine angle and the spinal cord. Meningiomas are generally
solitary. They have an increased frequency in patients with
neurofibromatosis 2 and are often multiple in these cases.
They are usually found in 2nd to 6th decades of life, with
slight female preponderance. Most meningiomas are benign
and can be removed successfully. Rarely, a malignant
meningioma may metastasise, mainly to the lungs.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, meningioma is
well-circumscribed, solid, spherical or hemispherical mass
of varying size (1-10 cm in diameter). The tumour is
generally firmly attached to the dura and indents the
surface of the brain but rarely ever invades it (Fig. 30.16).
The overlying bone usually shows hyperostosis. Cut
surface of the tumour is firm and fibrous, sometimes with
foci of calcification.
Microscopically, meningiomas are divided into 5 sub-
types: meningotheliomatous (syncytial), fibrous
(fibroblastic), transitional (mixed), angioblastic and
anaplastic (malignant).
1.
Meningotheliomatous (syncytial) meningioma. This
pattern of meningioma resembles the normal arachnoid
cap cells. The tumour consists of solid masses of polygonal
cells with poorly-defined cell membranes (i.e. syncytial
appearance). The cells have round to oval, central nuclei
with abundant, finely granular cytoplasm. Some amount
of collagenous stroma is present that divides the tumour
into irregular lobules.
2.
Fibrous (fibroblastic) meningioma. A less frequent
pattern is of a spindle-shaped fibroblastic tumour in which
the tumour cells form parallel or interlacing bundles.
Whorled pattern and psammoma bodies are less common
features of this type.
3.
Transitional (mixed) meningioma. This pattern is
characterised by a combination of cells with syncytial and
fibroblastic features with conspicuous whorled pattern of
tumour cells, often around central capillary-sized blood
vessels. Some of the whorls contain psammoma bodies
due to calcification of the central core of whorls (Fig. 30.17).
Other forms of degenerative changes like xanthomatous
and myxomatous degeneration may also be encountered,
in transitional variety.
These first three histologic patterns constitute a
spectrum of lesions rather than three distinct entities.
4.
Angioblastic meningioma. An angioblastic menin-
gioma includes 2 patterns: haemangioblastic pattern
resembling haemangioblastoma of the cerebellum, and
haemangiopericytic pattern which is indistinguishable from
haemangiopericytoma elsewhere in the body. Both types
of angioblastic meningiomas have high rate of recurrences.
Figure 30.16
Meningioma, The tumour mass is circumscribed (arrow) with irregular surface convolutions and prominent blood vessels. It is
firm in consistency with peripherally adherent thick firm dural tissue. Cut surface of the mass is firm and fibrous.

891
CHAPTER 30
The Nervous System
5.
Anaplastic (malignant) meningioma. Rarely, a
meningioma may display features of anaplasia and invade
the underlying brain or spinal cord. This pattern of
meningioma is associated with extraneural metastases,
mainly to the lungs.
METASTATIC  TUMOURS
Approximately a quarter of intracranial tumours are
metastatic tumours. The clinical features are like those of a
primary brain tumour. Most common primary tumours
metastasising to the brain are: carcinomas of the lung, breast,
skin (malignant melanoma), kidney and the gastrointestinal
tract and choriocarcinoma. Infiltration from lymphoma and
leukaemias may also occur.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the metastatic
deposits in the brain are usually multiple, sharply-defined
masses at the junction of grey and white matter
(Fig. 30.18). A less frequent pattern is carcinomatous
meningitis or meningeal carcinomatosis in which there is
presence of carcinomatous nodules on the surface of the
brain and spinal cord, particularly encountered in
carcinomas of the lung and breast.
Histologically, metastatic tumours in the brain
recapitulate the appearance of the primary tumour of
origin with sharp line of demarcation from adjoining brain
tissue. It is usually surrounded by a zone of oedema.
PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM
NORMAL STRUCTURE
The peripheral nervous system (PNS) consists of cranial and
spinal nerves, sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic
nervous system and the peripheral ganglia. The PNS is
involved in electric transmission of sensory and motor
impulses to and from the CNS. A peripheral nerve is
surrounded by an outer layer of fibrous tissue, the epineurium.
Each nerve is made of several fascicles enclosed in
multilayered membrane of flattened cells, the perineurium.
Each fascicle is composed of bundles of connective tissue,
the endoneurium. There are 2 main types of nerve fibres or
axons comprising a peripheral nerve—myelinated and non-
myelinated. Myelinated axons are thicker (diameter greater
than 2 μm) and are surrounded by a chain of Schwann cells
which produce myelin sheath. Non-myelinated axons have
diameter of 0.2-3 μm and about ten non-myelinated fibres
may be enclosed by a Schwann cell. Nodes of Ranvier on myeli-
nated fibres are the boundaries between each Schwann cell
surrounding the fibre (Fig. 30.18). Myelinated axons have
their origin from neurons in the posterior root ganglia and
the anterior horn cell of the spinal cord, whereas non-
myelinated axons arise from neurons in the posterior root
ganglia and in the autonomic ganglia.
PATHOLOGIC REACTIONS TO INJURY
The peripheral nerves, unlike brain, have regenerative
capacity as has been discussed on page 172. The pathologic
reactions of the PNS in response to injury may be in the
Figure 30.17
Meningioma, transitional type. The cells have features of both syncytial and fibroblastic type and form whorled appearance.
Some of the whorls contain psammoma bodies.
Figure 30.18
Metastatic tumour deposits in the brain. They are
commonly multiple, well-defined and usually located at the grey and
white matter junction.

892
SECTION III
Systemic Pathology
form of one of the types of degenerations causing peripheral
neuropathy or formation of a traumatic neuroma. There are
3 main types of degenerative processes in the PNS—
Wallerian degeneration, axonal degeneration and segmental
demyelination (Fig. 30.19):
WALLERIAN DEGENERATION. Wallerian degeneration
occurs after transection of the axon which may be as a result
of knife wounds, compression, traction and ischaemia.
Following transection, initially there is accumulation of
organelles in the proximal and distal ends of the transection
sites. Subsequently, the axon and myelin sheath distal to the
transection site undergo disintegration upto the next node
of Ranvier, followed by phagocytosis. The process of regene-
ration occurs by sprouting of axons and proliferation of
Schwann cells from the proximal end.
AXONAL DEGENERATION. In axonal degeneration,
degeneration of the axon begins at the peripheral terminal
and proceeds backward towards the nerve cell body. The
cell body often undergoes chromatolysis. There is Schwann
cell proliferation in the region of axonal degeneration. The
loss of axonal integrity occurs, probably as a result of some
primary metabolic disturbance within the axon itself.
Changes similar to those seen in Wallerian degeneration are
present but regenerative reaction is limited or absent.
SEGMENTAL DEMYELINATION. Segmental demyeli-
nation is similar to demyelination within the brain (page 884).
Segmental demyelination is loss of myelin of the segment
between two consecutive nodes of Ranvier, leaving a
denuded axon segment. The axon, however, remains intact.
Schwann cell proliferation generally accompanies demyeli-
nation. This results in remyelination of the affected axon.
Repeated episodes of demyelination and remyelination are
associated with concentric proliferation of Schwann cells
around axons producing ‘onion bulbs’ found in hypertrophic
neuropathy.
TRAUMATIC NEUROMA. Normally, the injured axon of
a peripheral nerve regenerates at the rate of approximately
1 mm per day. However, if the process of regeneration is
hampered due to an interposed haematoma or fibrous scar,
the axonal sprouts together with Schwann cells and
fibroblasts form a peripheral mass called as traumatic or
stump neuroma.
PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY
Peripheral neuropathy is the term used for disorders of the
peripheral nerves of any cause. It may be polyneuropathy,
mononeuropathy multiplex, and mononeuropathy.
Polyneuropathy is characteristically symmetrical with
noticeable sensory features such as tingling, pricking,
burning sensation or dysaesthesia in feet and toes. Motor
features in the form of muscle weakness and loss of tendon
reflexes may be present. Involvement of the autonomic
nervous system may be associated. Most cases have origin
in acquired metabolic and toxic causes such as thiamine
deficiency, diabetes, amyloidosis, autoimmune demyelinat-
ing disease (Guillain-Barré syndrome), and administration
of toxins and certain therapeutic agents (e.g. vincristine,
isoniazid). Besides these, a number of hereditary polyneuro-
pathies are described.
Pathologically, polyneuropathy may be the result of
axonal degeneration (axonopathy) or segmental
demyelination (demyelinating polyneuropathy). In each
type, acute, subacute and chronic forms are distinguished.
Guillain-Barré syndrome is the classical example of acute
demyelinating polyneuropathy which has probably an
autoimmune etiology.
Figure 30.19
Pathologic reaction of peripheral nerve to injury.

893
CHAPTER 30
The Nervous System
Mononeuropathy multiplex or multifocal neuropathy
is defined as simultaneous or sequential multifocal
involvement of nerve trunks which are not in continuity. The
involvement may be partial or complete and may evolve over
days or years. Multifocal neuropathy represents part of
spectrum of chronic acquired demyelinating neuropathy.
Mononeuropathy, on the other hand, is focal involve-
ment of a single nerve. It is generally the result of local causes
such as direct trauma, compression and entrapment.
NERVE SHEATH TUMOURS
Tumours of the peripheral nerves are commonly benign and
include schwannoma (neurilemmoma) and neurofibroma.
Both of them arise from Schwann cells but neurofibroma
contains large amount of collagen. Rarely, their malignant
counterpart, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour,
develops particularly in patients with von Recklinghausen’s
neurofibromatosis.
Schwannomas (Neurilemmomas)
Schwannomas or neurilemmomas arise from cranial and
spinal nerve roots. An acoustic schwannoma or acoustic neuroma
is an intracranial schwannoma located within the internal
auditory canal originating from vestibular portion of the
acoustic nerve (page 515). Intraspinal schwannomas are found
as intradural tumours in the thoracic region. In the peripheral
nerves, they occur as solitary nodule on any sheathed
sensory, motor, or autonomic nerve. Multiple schwannomas
are uncommon and occur in von Recklinghausen’s disease
(see below). Schwannomas are tumours of adults except in
von Recklinghausen’s disease.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, a schwannoma
is an encapsulated, solid, sometimes cystic, tumour that
produces eccentric enlargement of the nerve root from
where it arises.
Figure 30.20
Schwannoma (neurilemmoma), showing whorls of densely cellular (Antoni A) and loosely cellular (Antoni B) areas with characteristic
nuclear palisading (Verocay bodies).
Microscopically, the tumour is composed of fibrocellular
bundles forming whorled pattern. There are areas of dense
and compact cellularity (Antoni A pattern) alternating with
loose acellular areas (Antoni B pattern). Areas of Antoni A
pattern show palisaded nuclei called Verocay bodies
(Fig. 30.20). Nerve fibres are usually found stretched over
the capsule but not within the tumour. Areas of
degeneration contain haemosiderin and lipid-laden
macrophages. Schwann cells characteristically express
S-100 protein. A schwannoma rarely ever becomes
malignant.
Neurofibromas and von Recklinghausen’s Disease
Neurofibromas may occur as solitary, fusiform cutaneous
tumour of a single nerve, but more often are multiple
associated with von Recklinghausen’s disease. Solitary
neurofibroma is a tumour of adults but multiple
neurofibromas or neurofibromatosis is a hereditary disorder
with autosomal dominant inheritance. Solitary neurofibroma
is generally asymptomatic but patients with von
Recklinghausen’s disease have a triad of features:
Multiple cutaneous neurofibromas.
Numerous pigmented skin lesions (‘cafe au lait’ spots).
Pigmented iris hamartomas.
Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disorder having
mutation in chromosome 17 while type 2 has mutation in
chromosome 22.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, neurofibroma is
an unencapsulated tumour producing fusiform enlarge-
ment of the affected nerve. Neurofibromatosis in von
Recklinghausen’s disease is characterised by numerous
nodules of varying size, seen along the small cutaneous
nerves but may also be found in visceral branches of
sympathetic nerves. Neurofibromatosis may involve a

Systemic Pathology
group of nerves or may occur as multiple, oval and
irregular swellings along the length of a nerve (plexiform
neurofibroma) (Fig. 30.21).
Microscopically, a neurofibroma is composed of bundles
and interlacing fascicles of delicate and elongated spindle-
shaped cells having wavy nuclei. The cellular area is
separated by loose collagen and mucoid material. Residual
nerve fibres (neurites) may be demonstrable (Fig. 30.22).
Histologic appearance of Antoni B pattern of schwannoma
may be seen in neurofibroma and cause diagnostic
difficulty. Immunohistochemically, neurofibroma is
positive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and some
tumours express S-100 protein as schwannomas do.
Figure 30.21
Plexiform neurofibromatosis. The main mass is
multilobulated with increased fat while lower part of the image shows a
separate encapsulated gelatinous mass. Cut surface of both the masses
shows circumscribed, gelatinous, lobulated grey-white firm masses.
Figure 30.22
Neurofibroma, showing interlacing bundles of spindle-shaped cells separated by mucoid matrix. The cells have wavy nuclei and
a residual nerve fibre (neurite) is also identified.
Neurofibromas have tendency for local recurrences
after excision. Neurilemmoma virtually never turns
malignant, while sarcomatous transformation in neuro-
fibroma, particularly in neurofibromatosis, is not unusual.
It is estimated that about 3% of patients with von
Recklinghausen’s neurofibromatosis develop malignant
transformation of one of the nodules. Rarely, neurogenic
sarcoma may develop spontaneously in the absence of pre-
existing von Recklinghausen’s disease.
The contrasting features to distinguish neurofibroma
from schwannoma are listed in Table 30.5.
Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumour
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) is a
poorly differentiated spindle cell sarcoma of the peripheral
nerves occurring most often in adults. The tumour may arise
de novo or from malignant transformation of a pre-existing
neurofibroma than a schwannoma, generally at an early age
(20-40 years). About 50% of the tumours are seen in patients
with neurofibromatosis type 1 with chromosomal deletion
17p and p53 gene mutations, while some develop at sites of
previous irradiation.
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour
appears as an unencapsulated fusiform enlargement of a
nerve.
Microscopically, the tumour has the general appearance
of tumour cells resembling a fibrosarcoma. The tumour
has frequent mitosis and areas of necrosis. Triton tumour
is the name used for MPNST which has areas of poorly-
differentiated rhabdomyosarcoma, cartilage and bone.
Epithelioid MPNST has plump cells resembling
epithelioid cells and is positive for HMB-45 immuno-
stain. Most of the recurrent forms of MPNST are of
epithelioid type.

weight and measurement of an organ in disease, it is
important to be familiar with the normal values. In the

LABORATORY VALUES OF
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Currently, the concept of ‘normal values’ and ‘normal ranges’
is replaced by ‘reference values’ and ‘reference limits’ in
which the variables for establishing the values for the
reference population in a particular test are well defined.
Reference ranges are valuable guidelines for the clinician.
However, the following cautions need to be exercised in their
interpretation:
Firstly, they should not be regarded as absolute indicators
of health and ill-health since values for healthy individuals
often overlap with values for persons afflicted with disease.
Secondly, laboratory values may vary with the method
and mode of standardisation used; reference ranges given
below are based on the generally accepted values by the
standard methods in laboratory medicine.
Thirdly, although in most laboratories in the West and in
all medical and scientific journals, international units (IU)
conforming to the SI system are followed, but conventional
units continue to be used in many laboratories in the
developing countries of the world.
The WHO as well as International Committee for
Standardisation in Haematology (ICSH) have recommended
adoption of SI system by the scientific community throughout
world. In this section, laboratory values are given in both
conventional and international units. Conversion from one
system to the other can be done as follows:
mmol/L × atomic weight
mg/dl = __________________________________
     10
  mg/dl × 10
mmol/L = ___________________
  atomic weight
According to the SI system, the prefixes and conversion
factors for metric units of length, weight and volume are
given in Table A-2.
The laboratory values given here are divided into three
sections: clinical chemistry of blood (Table A-3), other body
fluids (Table A-4), and haematologic values (Table A-5). In
general, an alphabetic order has been followed.
